"However it is not simply those who are traditions away option plans to help you wedding just who declare that the college has started to become outdated. Particular 42% away from worry about-demonstrated conservatives (compared with 38% of liberals and 34% out-of moderates) say a comparable- regardless of if conservatives are not likely than moderates or liberals so you’re able to features ever cohabited. Also the most appropriate of one’s about three ideology communities to say that this new expanding diversity during the members of the family preparations was a good crappy thing.
Gender Positions; Members of the family Money
Back in 1977, survey respondents were almost similarly divided anywhere between individuals who told you marriages be a little more rewarding in the event the spouse produces a living additionally the spouse protects the household and you can youngsters (43%) and those who said marriages work best whenever both partners enjoys services and one another keep up with the home and you may students (48%).
From the 2010, public-opinion managed to move on heavily in favor of the dual money/common housewife model, that have survey participants favoring which layout by 62% in order to 31% over the plan that was far more common 50 years before.
Zero significant subgroup off questionnaire participants likes the newest older model, however be much more disposed like that than others. Eg, 42% regarding self-explained conservatives, 42% out-of Republicans and you will 37% of people age 65 and you can earlier state the standard plan will trigger more satisfying existence.
And additionally, quite far more guys (33%) than female (26%) end up being this way. While the married (35%) much more more likely than the solitary (24%) to say it.
Inspite of the public’s strong taste for the a couple-earner/mutual housewife relationship, the public has never totally abandoned the concept that folks play additional opportunities within the a marriage. In fact, when it comes to contrasting brand new getting power regarding future friends, the general public still has one practical to have potential husbands and you can a beneficial other you to definitely to have upcoming spouses.
Asked essential it’s to have men in an effort to help with a family economically in the event that he would like to wed, fully 67% of your own personal state it is “crucial.” Nevertheless when an identical question is asked about a woman, simply 33% state you will need to.
There are some variations because of the gender within these answers, but they do not change the basic development. Certainly men participants, 70% state men that is about to ily, when you find yourself just 27% say the same on the a woman. Certainly one of women respondents, 64% declare that about one and you can 39% regarding the a woman.
Competition and you will Relationships
You can find large distinctions about question by the battle. Fully 88% out of black respondents (compared to 62% off whites and you will 77% regarding Hispanics) declare that to become able to have ily economically. As well, 50% from black respondents (compared to 47% from Hispanics and you can twenty-eight% regarding whites) declare that a female https://lovingwomen.org/no/polske-kvinner/ can assistance a family group financially to be ready to own matrimony.
In short, blacks certainly are the racial category most tempted to believe financial safety a prerequisite so you can wedding. But, thanks to their apparently lowest median income, of several blacks do not see one pub.
The fresh rates off matrimony in the black colored community mirror this mismatch. Under one-3rd out-of mature blacks (32%) are currently partnered, compared with 50 % of Hispanics and you may 56% regarding whites, predicated on Census Bureau analysis. On the other hand, 44% off blacks have not been married, weighed against just 23% regarding whites. The fresh racial matrimony gap failed to was previously so it large. Within the 1960, 17% off mature blacks and you can fourteen% out of mature whites have been never ever married-a space of merely step 3 fee things.
An equivalent trend applies to education and you may marriage. University students are more almost certainly than those instead a college education to-be hitched now (64% compared to. as much as fifty%). Studying the show ones who’ve never ever married, in the you to definitely-third (32%) from adults with degree and 30% of them with high college training or less have never hitched, compared to just 21% out-of people with a college education. Half a century ago, the reverse is genuine: college or university students was more likely than simply people with high university diploma otherwise smaller getting never been hitched (18% vs.13%).",<urn:uuid:8cd4575d-befe-45c5-9dea-9d76a6b1a93c>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://199cr.com/archives/25628,2024-02-20T21:54:18Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9637834429740906,1001,1.6656570434570312,2
"That is to say, it’s a major departure from the authoritative air and hard-edged beauty of Singapore – in the best possible way.
The most eventful thing we did in Manila was buy our suits for Trevor’s wedding. I’ll get to that in a follow-up post. But there were some remarkable charms to this place, despite its rough exterior.
For instance, we stayed at a great little hotel/hostel, about a quarter mile from the ocean, called the Buoy. The owner was a domineering asshole, but fortunately we only met him once. His staff, on the other hand, were a delight. The all-female staff of the attached restaurant/bar were especially sweet and great to be around, and this led us to favor the hotel for our near-constant drinking during the few days we were there. We’d sit and drink buckets of beer, and work on this stupid little website we have (maybe you’ve heard of it), and play pool, and hang out with the Buoy girls. We spent a lot of time that way. (Hi girls!)
I’m pleased to report that we also reconnected with our old college pal Cat “I just keep getting prettier” Tolentino. Her family hails from ’round Manila way, so she happened to be there on a vacation. We met a number of her family members, whose names and relationships I forgot as soon as I learned them. Cat was also the one who recommended that we go to Boracay, which turned out to be one of the crazier experiences of our whole trip (post forthcoming).
We also spent some time hanging out with an American ex-military guy named Jack, now living in Cebu, who was absolutely insane. And we were lucky for it – he took us around to places we never would have seen, and told us stories that kept us laughing for days afterward. Jack, if you’re reading this, it was a real pleasure and we hope to see you again down the road.
Enough of the sentimental stuff. Some other distinctions of note for Manila:
- Worst food – Vince and I joked that the Filipino national dish seemed to be an unadorned boiled hotdog on a plate with some rice. (The burger I had at the place we went with Cat was excellent, but that was the exception. And that sucker was like $15.)
- Most McDonald’s eaten (see #1 above)
- Most beer ordered/consumed in bucket form
- Best Wingman Ever (title awarded to Franklin Page). I’m not going to write the story out here. You’ll just have to ask us sometime.

"A game by Ismael Rodriguez for PC, originally released in 2021.
Below the Ocean is a subaquatic puzzle-platformer centered around discovering four ancient treasures deep beneath the ocean’s depths. You take on the role of an explorer who drops to the ocean floor using a diving bell, and then dons a pressure suit to explore his surroundings… all the while tied to a tether that feeds oxygen to his suit. Many dangers await, in the form of hostile sea creatures, genre staple spikes, mysterious technology, and a nasty death by suffocation should he take too many risks.The game is divided into four areas, all of which are accessible from the start, and each area begins with a diving bell sequence, during which time the diver ruminates over the stories he has heard throughout his life of great treasures, strange secrets, and places that exist below the water itself. And each time, he repeats the phrase, “This abyss is my destiny.” Each area represents a single descent to find one of four treasures: The Queen's Pearl, The Cardinal's Grail, The Nobleman's Crest, and The Soldier's Spade.
As is common in puzzle-platformers, controls are simple, but the ways in which you use your abilities become more complex as the game goes on. To start, you have slow movement and a floaty jump, due to the fact that you are moving underwater, and you have the ability to wall jump along most surfaces. Grabbing a bubble gives you a one-time double jump – after which the bubble pops – and there are different kinds of bubbles to be found later in the game (more on this in a bit). When inside a bubble, you are pushed along by air currents, often allowing you to reach higher areas, but sometimes pushing you toward danger, requiring you to pop the bubble before you are killed.
What makes this game truly unique as a puzzle platformer is the air hose that tethers you back to a nearby oxygen tank. First of all, the tether limits your movement to a short range, often (but not always) extending about two-thirds of the width of the screen. This limited range is the basis for most puzzles as the only way to continue moving forward is to reach another oxygen tank, thereby giving you a new tether point. Oxygen tanks also act as checkpoints.
Secondly, when you reach the full length of your tether, you are tugged backward with a small amount of elasticity. More importantly, when pressing in the opposite direction of the tether, you can swing yourself upward, allowing you to reach higher platforms, switches, and new oxygen tanks. Sometimes you need to wrap your tether around a block to shorten its range. There are a variety of ways you can wrap the tether around blocks to reach new platforms, hang off of ledges, or even swing yourself to distant points.
Puzzle solutions are generally apparent or may be discovered through a bit of experimentation, so puzzle platforming veterans can expect to make it through the game fairly quickly. However, there’s a secondary challenge in the form of diamonds that are spread throughout the four areas. Collecting all of these diamonds is more difficult and often requires the use of advanced techniques. Similar to the strawberries in Celeste, diamonds don’t count as being collected until you reach a safe area, which in this case is the next oxygen tank checkpoint. Reaching the end of each area displays a summary showing your completion time, number of deaths, and number of diamonds collected.
Things start out simply enough in the opening area, with the player primarily tasked with moving from one oxygen tank to the next as he learns the controls for wall jumping, swinging on the tether, and using bubbles to double jump (bubble jump?). Diamonds in the first area are placed generally along the player’s path, and these are not too difficult to collect. Toward the end of the area, the player encounters yellow blocks that imbue the tether and the diver with electricity. The player must wrap his tether around these energy blocks, activate a switch to open the door to the exit, and then unwind the tether to actually leave the room.
The second area introduces new gameplay concepts more quickly than the first, requiring players to make use of more complex techniques, but these all build off of one another, creating a sudden yet smooth difficulty curve. The first new gameplay element comes in the form of small oxygen tanks that merely extend the total length of the player’s tether, and these do not act as checkpoints. Here, the player must string together multiple successful movements to move between several oxygen tanks and reach the exit. Notably, tethers from these small tanks tend to be shorter, allowing the player less freedom of movement. Reaching large oxygen tanks breaks all of the previous tethers and grants the player a new one, just as in the first area.
The player also encounters sea life in this area, including turtles that can be used as springboards, hermit crabs that can be kicked around, and blue crabs that will kill him if he touches them. From this point forward, any blue lifeforms are deadly to the player.
This area also introduces blue bubbles. Instead of simply allowing for a double jump, these allow the player to move in any direction for a couple of seconds, allowing for quick jets upward, at angles, or across gaps. These bubbles are also pushed along by air currents, allowing for more complex sequences where the player must allow himself to be pushed in one direction before quickly making use of his multi-directional speed boost.
At the end of the first area, the player drops into an area below the water. Here, he runs around unencumbered by a tether or the need for oxygen, but while his movement speed is greatly increased, his jump height is tiny and he cannot wall jump or use bubbles. In the second area, new elements are introduced where the player enters air pockets that work in the same way, but things quickly become more complex when he encounters tether tie-offs that aren’t oxygen tanks. From these points, the player has 10 seconds to reach an air pocket or another oxygen tank before he is killed.
This area also introduces springboards that launch you into the air, tether tie-offs that let you fire yourself in a chosen direction like a slingshot, smooth surfaces where you can’t wall jump, and the ability to kill enemies by electrifying your tether. Future areas don’t pile on quite so many new gameplay elements in such a short span.
The third area introduces yellow angular bits that must be collected in sets of four in order to activate tether tie-offs (again giving you 10 seconds to get to safety). There are also launchers that send you along in a given direction and claws that reach out to grab you and connect you to new oxygen tanks. The biggest gameplay change comes in the form of clear tanks (helium tanks?) that allow you to jump between the floor and the ceiling and build up momentum to break rock walls.
The final area introduces electrified bubbles that let you speed along in a given direction, just like the blue bubbles, and this can be used to stretch your tether further. If you kill an enemy while electrified – or hit certain designated nodes – your charge is restored, leading to sequences where you must quickly zip between multiple targets to stay aloft. There are also some speed-based sequences where you must outrun rows of falling spikes. Unfortunately, there is no ending upon completing the fourth and final area, and you are simply returned to the area select interface, just as you are when completing any other area.
Visually, the game is presented with chunky low-rez sprites and a very limited color palette consisting of white, grey, blue, and yellow, with black as the background color. The game is accompanied by low tempo music that fits well with the underwater theme. There isn’t any kind of narrative to tie the experience together, outside of the vague (and grammatically problematic) monologues that introduce each area. Nothing more is made of the mysterious treasures nor the area that exists below the ocean’s water.
Below the Ocean was developed by Ismael Rodriguez, who is based in Connecticut. The game was originally developed for Ludum Dare 48, which had a theme of “deeper and deeper”, and essentially consisted of this game’s first area. Three new areas were added to expand the game into a more complete experience. This was Ismael’s first retail release.",<urn:uuid:74c46249-3a4e-43ec-9be4-579b7ef7ded8>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://8bithorse.blogspot.com/2021/12/below-ocean.html,2024-02-20T21:23:36Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9593459367752075,1757,1.5798628330230713,2

"Whether your Veterans Affairs (VA) claim or appeal is likely to succeed or not, the wait can be painful. Wear and tear from military service, combat injuries and accidents on the job can create agony that won't wait for an answer from the VA. If you're waiting for a response or working on a new appeal, don't assume that you need to suffer or spend lots of money out of pocket to make the situation better. Keep a few services and options in mind as you wait for the VA's decision and be prepared no matter the outcome.
The VA Clinic Welcome You
When you filed your first VA claim, you should have been called in for a visit to a local VA facility. If everything went right, you should have been enrolled in VA healthcare services before leaving the VA facility.
Veterans involved in VA claims as of 2014 are told about the new VA identification card that allows easier identification and some civilian-based clinic care depending on what benefits you qualify for.
The card helps by making veteran identification easier, but the attached benefits have been part of the system for many years. Between major military campaigns, a ""lost generation"" of sorts exists that may not learn of certain services.
If you've been waiting on an appeal or stopped trying before these new services arrived, you can enjoy the new benefits by confirming your eligibility for benefits on this information page. Although there are multiple categories and exceptions, the basic benefits are given to veterans with an honorable discharge.
If you need cold medication or a medical checkup because of a strange feeling or many other forms of medical assistance not related to surgery, you can walk into the VA to receive assistance. The downside of this service is that there are long wait times at some clinics, which means appointments could take weeks while walk-in visits may take hours for the main doctor consultation.
A Lawyer Can Help You Expand Services
With access tot he VA clinic, you can do a bit of extra research about your VA claim. Set appointments that are related to the problems listed on your complaint in order to get new evidence in the form of examination results.
Eventually, you may need a second opinion. The VA may not be able to give you referral if you're not having an emergency, but a lawyer can help you push through the VA's resistance. By outlining your need for medical care and negotiating with VA officials, a personal injury lawyer can organize a team of medical professionals that can develop the evidence you need for a successful claim.
The need for a lawyer in this case is unfortunate, but the long wait times related to VA services means that you may need to get aggressive to get the attention you need. Once you have the attention, your lawyer can work on designing a new appeal or adding additional information that may be more likely to succeed. Contact a personal injury lawyer to begin planning strategies for better medical treatment and a more robust VA injury claim.",<urn:uuid:b4079e96-fa2c-40ee-9df5-ad029698f3ea>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://badiabeaute.com/2015/08/20/getting-additional-health-and-legal-help-during-va-appeals/,2024-02-20T21:12:10Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9617775082588196,588,1.0155878067016602,1

"Adversary Proceedings are not that common in bankruptcy cases but when they do happen, you will want a professional with experience handling Adversary Proceedings. The process is a very unique and only used in bankruptcy cases. Adversary Proceedings are not the same as a state collection court action or a Federal District Court complaints. Rather, the Adversary Proceeding is a specialized complaint with specific rules to follow that only experienced attorneys know how to manage.
What does an Adversary Proceedings do? In general, Adversary Proceedings are complaints filed in Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 cases alleging that a debt should be non-dischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C §523 or 11 U.S.C §727 or other qualified legal liability. These claims are brought by a creditor in the case because the creditor believes that the debtor received money or services from the creditor due to misrepresentation, fraud and etc. The general concept is that it would be wrong for the debtor to be allowed to discharge the debt because of the alleged bad acts that the debtor committed.
The Phillips Law Offices, LLC provides both Plaintiff and Defense services in Adversary Proceedings:
Creditors often think that there is nothing that can be done once a debtor files a bankruptcy case in order to collect a debt. If the debtor has acted in bad faith in order to ascertain the debt, creditors have a lot of rights to pursue the debtor, including filing an Adversary Proceeding. Many collection attorneys only understand state court proceedings and do not understand the opportunities for a creditor in filing an Adversary Proceeding against the debtor. Creditors need seasoned bankruptcy attorneys like the Phillips Law Offices, LLC to file an Adversary Proceeding for it is a unique process that many state collection lawyers simply are not equipped or experienced enough to handle. It is important to remember that Adversary Proceedings can allow creditors protection from discharge of the entire debt the debtor owes plus any interest that the creditors are entitled too.
Debtors who are sued by a creditor in an Adversary Proceeding need to be concern and do need to defend themselves. Many attorneys who file bankruptcy cases do not know or have the experience in defending Adversary Proceedings. Debtors will need a firm like the Phillips Law Offices, LLL to properly defend them against these actions. Debtor can face if the Adversary Proceeding is successful non-dischargeability of a debt or even more serious a complete denial of their bankruptcy case for life. Either way, creditors will still be entitled to collect on the debt owed by the debtors.
Stakes are extremely high with Adversary Proceedings for either creditors or debtors. The Phillips Law Offices, LLC experience in bringing Adversary Proceedings and defending Adversary Proceedings will increase the margin of success in dealing with these high stakes.",<urn:uuid:01d3770b-8345-4913-b070-f120e9e062cb>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://bankruptcyfixesdebt.com/services/bankruptcy-litigation/,2024-02-20T22:26:44Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9490294456481934,581,1.1926060914993286,1

Bhutan is a landlocked mountainous country in the eastern Himalaya. To the north lies China and to its south is India. It is a country roughly the size of Switzerland with a population of nearly seven hundred thousand. People of the north and central parts of Bhutan belong to the mongoloid race while the people from the south belong to the Aryan race. Buddhism and Hinduism are two major religions practiced by the people of the land though other religious beliefs are gaining grounds too. The hereditary monarchy of the past has given way to the democratic constitutional monarchy of the present. Dzongkha is its national language. “Gho” and “Kira” are the national dresses worn by men and women respectively.
Bhutan is a must visit holiday destination for people who are in search of real peace and solitude. It is also an emerald paradise for the seekers of wilderness and wild adventures. The land is proud of the world highest unclimbed peak, its rich floral and faunal diversity, culture like nowhere else and architecture and cuisines which are indeed unique. Another popular brand made in Bhutan is GNH or Gross National Happiness which is the country’s guiding development philosophy-the brainchild of the fourth king. For all these reasons Bhutan is indeed a must visit place on earth.

"- It means objects are Garbage Collected more quickly. (Incorrect).
- Its a good way to make sure all your references are set to null. (Not necessary).
- Its good practice to implement all the time. (Incorrect).
- The Garbage Collector calls IDisposable.Dispose() automatically. (Incorrect).
- Its a good idea when you are creating lots of objects in a short period of time. (There is a better way).
What is it?
The IDisposable interface seems to be a commonly misunderstood and misused interface. Some developers like to implement it as a matter of course thinking it is good practice. But it is absolutely not necessary when dealing with managed objects (native .Net objects). In .Net the Garbage Collector (GC) is more than capable of finding and disposing all objects quickly and efficiently.
To quote Andrew Troelsen: ""Allocate an object onto the heap using the new keyword and forget about it"".
The GC stores lists of objects in generations ""young"" objects have a lower generation number than longer lived objects. The lists of young generation objects are examined more frequently than higher generation lists of objects. Commonly there are many more short lived objects than long lived ones. The IDisposable interface is more than an interface, you could argue its more of a design pattern. To use it correctly requires more than just merely implementing the interface and satisfying the compiler.
When to use it?
The interface is only necessary to properly clean up resources and release memory when a class references unmanaged code. Commonly this boils down to:
- When a class references or calls a COM object.
- When a class references or calls a C++ object, (or Win32).
- When a class has an OS File Handle to a file resource that needs to be closed when the object is destroyed.
- You inherit from a class that implements IDisposable.
- You have a long lived field reference to an IDisposable class.
Just to reiterate, you do not need to implement it when only referencing .Net native types (managed types) or types that you have created yourself that are based on other .Net types etc. You also do not need to implement it if one of the classes you reference has a reference to unmanaged code, only worry about the code in the current class (OO design principle ""encapsulation"").
You also do not need to set objects to null; you may have once upon a time in COM and preceding technologies, but not in .Net. By doing so you are merely adding an unnecessary assignment to your code which if used everywhere will ultimately slow down your application.
So, how to use it properly?
REMEMBER: If you do choose to implement IDisposable you are declaring to any consumers of your class that its life cycle needs to be carefully managed. 99% of the time it should be used within a using block. It should never be returned as a result of a function. If you consume a class that implements IDisposable, then ideally you need enclose it in a using block and not keep a field reference. If you need to keep a field reference, then your class should also implement IDisposable. In addition if you inherit from a class that implements IDisposable then your new class also needs to consider reimplementing IDisposable.
Best shown with an example. Here's an example of how to implement the interface correctly.
Its also important to note that there are a few best practice guidelines for IDisposable (from the Framework Design Guidelines book).
When a class implements IDisposable, it is declaring to the outside world that you must use it with care. You must use it and it is your responsibility to call Dispose, only you will call Dispose it doesn't auto-magically get called. Generally most experienced senior developers I know will agree you should always use a IDisposable object wrapped in a Using block.
Secondly you avoid returning an IDisposable object as the result of a function, the consumer more than likely will not check to see if it needs to be disposed; leading to IDisposable.Dispose() not being called. Hello memory leak. This follows the first rule above, you cannot wrap an IDisposable object in a Using block and return it from a function.
What if you are creating lots of objects in a short period of time and only need them very briefly?
If doing nothing means there will be a lot of memory locked for a time until the GC collects them, then simply call GC.Collect() every so often periodically to kick the collector into checking for resources to free immediately. Alternatively you can use the GC.AddMemoryPressure() and GC.RemoveMemoryPressure() functions to tell the GC there is a higher demand on memory than is usual and it should consider collection more frequently. These two options are better than implementing IDisposable, because its less work, and by implementing IDisposable your code has more work to do because you are running another method on each of the large number of objects you have created and will more than likely be slower.
Be careful with these methods however, as with anything like this you should only use these if you have already proved with testing that it is better to use them than to not.
As a side issue, when calling GC.Collect() you should also call GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers().
When you manually force a collection, you should call WaitForPendingFinalizers() to cause the current thread to wait for all finalizers to finish running. This prevents you from calling any code on an object while it is being destroyed. Once this method returns (synchronously) you can check for null reference as per normal and then safely invoke a method if the pointer is non-null.
So how do you stop IDisposable from spreading through your code like a cancer?
There's a good topic on Stack Overflow on this very topic here. The short answer is its not easy. The long and short of it is:
- Only implement IDisposable if you are using unmanaged resources or keeping a reference to an IDIsposable and your class is responsible for creating it. (The class creating it should be the class responsible for destroying it).
- Prefer to consume IDisposable classes inside a using block.
- Avoid returning an IDisposable class as a return object.
- Keep expensive resource management in one place.
- Prefer a create-on-demand pattern over singletons or long lived IDisposables.",<urn:uuid:90507c78-9312-4631-88d3-6ac553e4e590>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://blog.rees.biz/2010/08/idisposable-what-is-it-when-to-use-it.html,2024-02-20T22:06:22Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9242141842842102,1381,3.2892746925354004,3
"Which Premiership player has scored the most goals without winning an international cap?
Certainly for some time it was Kevin Campbell, who also appeared on a list originally published by the Guardian, of the 10 best players in the Premier League never to get a full cap.
I’m not sure if Campbell’s record has been overtaken but I am sure he still is up there as one of the players who scored a lot and never got a cap.
But despite his work in winning the 1991 title he is not, it seems to me, that fondly remembered at Arsenal – which is a shame because he did make a valuable contribution, especially to that league championship.
Kevin Campbell scored 76 Premiership goals for Arsenal. He was born 4 February 1970 who played for Arsenal, Nottm Forest, Everton and WBA, as well as Trabzonspor, Leyton Orient, Leicester City and Cardiff City.
He signed for Arsenal in 1985 and made his debut in the first team against Everton in an end of season outing on 7 May 1988.
Having been a top scorer in the youth team he showed his ability again in 1989 on loan with Orient, with nine goals in 16, but after a few starts in 1989-90 he went to Leicester on loan before breaking into the Arsenal team near the end of the campaign, joining in the championship winning 1990/1 season, scoring eight in ten.
Arsenal then signed Ian Wright in 1991 but Campbell stayed in the team making 22 league starts and 9 appearances as a sub that season with 13 goals. He was also part of the FA Cup and League Cup double. In 1993/4 he had his best goal scoring season getting 19 in all competitions and won the Cup Winners’ Cup, but in 1994/5 despite 19 starts and four appearances as a sub in the league he only got four goals. The management changed, John Hartson and Dennis Bergkamp turned up and that was that.
He made his last appearance for us on his birthday on 4 February 1995 in Sheffield Wednesday 3 Arsenal 1. He had played 224 times for Arsenal, scoring 59 goals in all major competitions.
So in the summer break of 1995 he was sold to Nottingham Forest who were European Champions. The side were relegated and promoted back during his three years there.
He then went to Trabzonspor but only stayed seven months, getting what was at the time the inevitable racist attacks on him. Indeed remembering that era I recall thinking, “did no one tell him that is what happened in Turking football?” It is reported that the club president was among those engaging in rampant racism.
He returned to England to sign for Everton in March 1999 on loan – later turned into a permanent deal. To seemingly everyone’s surprise, after not scoring in this first two games he got nine goals in the next seven. At the same moment Francis Jeffers came to life for Everton, and the partnership was a huge success – albeit for a very short while.
But still he became the club captain but he started to be hampered by injuries, and once more seemed to be fading out as a player until David Moyes reactivated his career in 2002/3 – before replacing Campbell with Marcus Bent as the solo striker – and ultimately discovering Wayne Rooney.
Campbell is still highly regarded in Everton circles, although his goal totals there were not huge (but he was their top scorer several times, once with just ten goals.)
In January 2005 Campbell went to WBA as club captain and helped them avoid relegation. However they did go down the following season and he moved on to Cardiff in the Championship in August 2006. He scored but one goal for them in the Welsh Cup against Carmarthen Town, and played his last game on 20 February 2007: Cardiff v WBA.
Since retirement he has owned a record label, appeared on Sky Sports and Premier League TV stations in Asia, and run a security company.
Overall for Arsenal he played 124 league games, made 42 appearances as sub, and scored 46 goals. Although he never hit the absolute heights for Arsenal, he’ll always be remembered (at least in the Arsenal History Society) for his work in helping us to the title in the 1990/1 season.",<urn:uuid:db9053fe-f85d-4ccc-8fb4-245e60713e18>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://blog.woolwicharsenal.co.uk/archives/9427,2024-02-20T22:32:07Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9913655519485474,865,1.0375235080718994,1
"I wish that batteries would improve, especially for cell cellphones.
It feels love every successive new model of the major smartphones available are consistently maxing out limits of what new battery technology can achieve.
As soon as they get a better battery that lasts longer, the cellphone engineers utilize the additional capacity plus then your cellphone has the same battery performance as the previous one. I realize that there is a tradeoff between features plus battery performance. That’s why our Chromebook has a 10 hour battery life, as it runs as a lite-version of a normal ipad. Since I just need it for internet plus typing, it’s a phenomenal unit for how cheap it was. Cannabis vaporizer pens are similar when it comes to batteries. A basic oil cartridge can run on a pen battery without much trouble. It only needs more than one to more than three volts of electricity to get a nice vaporized hit of cannabis oil. However, dab pens need more watts because the concentrate needs to be decarboxylated first, which requires more power. And to get a strong plus dense vapor, you’re also going to need more watts. That’s why you see those big looking batteries for the vaporizer atomizers that can handle concentrates love bubble hash plus live rosin. The cannabis cartridge products are easy enough to run on the cheap batteries as long as you match them with a battery that will recognize them, otherwise they’re extremely finicky. That’s one reason I switched to dabbing cannabis concentrates plus quit buying cannabis vaporizer cartridges. My sibling prefers the pre-filled cartridges because they already have the cannabis oil ready to go, making it much easier than dabbing.",<urn:uuid:49562677-334b-4e53-b6ed-6437c0b34418>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://cannabisforweightloss.com/2022/07/cannabis-cartridge-products-can-be-finicky-depending-on-what-kind-of-battery-you-use-5/,2024-02-20T21:39:36Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9377194046974182,350,1.1589932441711426,1

"Insights into my 2022 paper “Interdependence of Growth, Structure, Size and Resource Consumption of the Economy”
December 5, 2021
Carey W. King
This blog summarizes outcomes from my most recent publication:
King, Carey W. (2022) Interdependence of Growth, Structure, Size and Resource Consumption During an Economic Growth Cycle, Biophysical Economics and Sustainability, volume 7, Article number: 1. Free online access: website link and pdf.
The purpose of this paper is to discuss the dynamic interdependencies among growth, size, and structure of an economy using outputs from an updated version of the Human and Resources with MONEY (HARMONEY) model that was published in 2020. This new version is HARMONEY v1.1.
Because of its structure, the HARMONEY model helps “narrow the differences” between economic and ecological viewpoints, which as the late Martin Weitzmann suggested, provides value by creating enhanced understanding of economic dynamics. That is to say, because the model simultaneously tracks physical and monetary stocks and flows, by including physical resources and constraints along with macroeconomic accounting and debt, HARMONEY speaks the language of both economists and physical and natural scientists.
I summarize the following insights from the paper:
- Insight #1: Efficiency begets more consumption and accumulation, not less (Jevons Paradox)
- Insight #2: Economy Shows Same Energy-Size Scaling as Biological Growth
- Insight #3: Enhanced Interpretation of Decoupling Resource Consumption from GDP
- Insight #4: Labor (wage share) vs. Capital (capital share) vs. Resource Consumption Tradeoff
- Insight #5: Evolution of Economic Structure and Complexity
See below for “How the Model Works” and of course you can read the full paper for free.
Insight #1: Efficiency begets more consumption and accumulation, not less (Jevons Paradox)
One of the frustrating aspects of reading most journal papers and discussions of economic modeling is the treatment of the concept of energy efficiency. Given the HARMONEY v1.1 assumption that higher profits translate to increased investment, increasing energy efficiency clearly enables increased natural resource depletion (Fig. 1a), while enabling the economy to achieve higher resource extraction rates (Fig. 1b), population (Fig. 1c), capital accumulation (Fig. 1d), and net output (or GDP, not shown). In other words, the HARMONEY model supports the Jevons Paradox, or backfire effect, in that higher fuel efficiency in operating capital increases overall economic size and consumption. This theoretical finding is consistent with studies supporting the evidence for a strong rebound effect, as well as the general observation that over the course of industrialization to date, the human economy has indeed invented and employed more efficient processes while at the same time consumed more energy decade to decade.
Figure 1. HARMONEY shows how increased resource efficiency of capital (e.g., as fuel) enables more growth and resource depletion.
Insight #2: Economy Shows Same Energy-Size Scaling as Biological Growth
Figure 2 (Figure 4 in the paper) demonstrates an additional explanation of the relationship between natural resources consumption and growth by making an explicit comparison to biological growth. Figure 2a compares a typical metabolism versus mass trend (for a cow starting from birth per West et al. 2001) to corresponding results from the HARMONEY model. Here I’m explicitly comparing two things.
First, an animal’s metabolism compares to the natural resources consumption in HARMONEY, and to total primary energy consumption in the real world data: animal metabolism compares to economy energy consumption.
Second, animal mass compares to physical capital (like cars and buildings) in the economy: animal mass compares to economic (physical) capital. In the real economy there is a problem with adding up all the capital, but that is a much-discussed longer story, so I won’t go into that here. Thus, most existing studies that make the economic-biological growth comparison plot primary energy versus gross domestic product (GDP), which is not as consistent of a comparison. However, in HARMONEY, capital is a well-defined concept that can be summed consistently so I plot resource consumption versus both capital and GDP.
Figure 2a displays curves for an animal (e.g., a cow) total metabolic power and basal metabolic power, scaling with mass to the 0.5 and 0.75 power, respectively. The difference between “total” and “basal” is the metabolic power allocated to growth of new mass (shown at the bottom of the chart). One important point is that most organisms grow only to a certain size, with the trajectory of Fig. 2a moving up and to the right, eventually stopping at some point (indicated by the big red dot). The HARMONEY scenarios (assuming full cost pricing) show the same type of trajectory.
Figure 2. A comparison of patterns between (a) biological growth (metabolism and mass) and (b and c) economic growth (natural resources consumption and (b) capital and (c) GDP.
Figures 2b and 2c show the full cost pricing simulation for HARMONEY to compare to biological growth. Just like in growth of an animal, the economy grows until a point at which it stops and remains at a steady state value of resource extraction, GDP, and capital. Also, total and “basal” metabolism (for animals) and resource consumption (for the economy) come together at the end of growth (which is pretty much the definition of the end of growth).
Figure 2c shows the gray line from a simulation which assumes increases in resource efficiency of capital (like fuel efficiency, same as results in Figure 1). Again, you can see that the final values of GDP and resource consumption rates are higher if the economy can operate capital at higher efficiency. We can also see that the resource extraction scales pretty similarly to both capital and GDP. It is an open question as to how insightful it is to relate economic metabolism to GDP instead of capital; perhaps both are useful.
Insight #3: Enhanced Interpretation of Decoupling Resource Consumption from GDP
This paper has much to say on the issue of relative decoupling defined as increasing GDP faster than increasing resources consumption. Decoupling can be envisioned by plotting data as in Figure 3 which shows the growth rate (e.g., the rate of increase) of energy and resources consumption versus the growth rate of GDP. Global data use real gross world product (GWP) and global primary energy consumption.
Figure 3. (a) Global data showing the growth rate of primary energy consumption versus growth rate of real gross world product. (b) Comparable data from the HARMONEY model for growth rate of resources consumption versus growth rate of GDP.
Relative decoupling occurs when the growth rate data are below the 1:1 sloped line, in the shaded area (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Relative decoupling occurs when the growth rate data are below the 1:1 sloped line, in the shaded area.
Figure 5 shows that both the global data and the HARMONEY simulations show the same temporal trend which is to move in a clockwise direction in the figure. First the both energy and resources consumption increases at nearly the same rate as GDP, and they both increase growth rates (which is to say grow faster over time). This is to say the growth rates move up and to the right along the 1:1 line. Second, once growth rates no longer increase, they move down and to the left into the relative decoupling zone. For the global data since the mid-1970s, GWP has grown at about 3%/year and primary energy consumption at about 2%/year.
Figure 5. Both the (a) global data and (b) HARMONEY simulations show the same clockwise trend over time.
One important interpretation of this trend in growth rates goes against how most people think of the role of energy efficiency in relative decoupling. A common interpretation of relative decoupling is that it occurs because the economy becomes more efficient in its consumption of energy in producing the goods and services of which GDP is composed. However, when the HARMONEY model results reside in the decoupling zone, there is no change in any parameters of the model that can be associated with resource efficiency! In fact, the opposite is the case: due to resource depletion, in the relative decoupling phase the dominant feedback is one of decreasing efficiency in that more resource consumption is required to extract a higher rate of resources.
The HARMONEY model moves from the 1:1 “full coupling” line to the relative decoupling zone because the GDP and resources consumption can no longer increase at increasingly high rates. That is to say, not only does a stage of relative decoupling occur during periods with no perceivable increase in device energy efficiency, the shift to this stage of growth is evidence for limits to growth, not evidence against limits to growth. In HARMONEY v1.1, resource limits eventually constrain growth to go slower, and eventually go to zero, due to the definition of the forest-like natural resource in the model.
However, this is not to say that increasing resource efficiency is completely unassociated with higher levels of relative decoupling. Figure 6 shows that increasing the resource consumption efficiency of machines, the economy can move more deeply into a state of relative decoupling.
Figure 6. HARMONEY results highlighting that while relative decoupling is not definitively associated with increasing resource efficiency, an increase in resource operating efficiency of capital does move the results more deeply into relative decoupling.
Insight #4: Labor (wage share) vs. Capital (capital share) vs. Resource Consumption Tradeoff
Income inequality has been foremost in the minds of many people for the last 10-15 years. The contemporary explanation is that there is a battle between “labor” (wages) and “capital’ (profits). One way to measure this “battle” is to compare the share of GDP gong to wages (wage share) versus profits (capital or profit share).
The claim is that since the 1970s workers have lost “bargaining power”, or the legitimacy and support to ask for higher wages, largely because of the decline in support (including from elected officials) for union membership. I tested this idea in this paper, and the HARMONEY supports this general premise, but suggests there is more to the story: resource consumption rates.
I model workers having full bargaining power when their wages can increase with inflation. Figure 7 shows that wage share declines during the growth phase as companies acquire some profit share. However, once resource extraction rates level off (refer back to Figure 1), wage share rebounds back to its initial higher level and profit share declines to zero.
Figure 7. When resource consumption rates peak (and no longer increase), and when workers can bargain for wages, (a) wage share (the fraction of GDP going to wages) can stay high and rebound while (b) profit share of companies declines to zero.
Figure 8 shows that if we slowly remove bargaining power (by no longer allowing wages to increase with inflation) when resource extraction per person peaks (just as the trend begins in the U.S. economy), then wage share either declines (for the “full cost” scenario) as companies continue to invest in capital or wage share remains low (for the “marginal cost scenario). See the full paper for descriptions of two different assumptions for production costs.
Figure 8. When resource consumption rates peak (and no longer increase), and when workers can bargain for wages, (a) wage share (the fraction of GDP going to wages) can stay high and rebound while (b) profit share of companies declines to zero.
These results show that nature of the distribution of economic proceeds changes once the economy stops growing. As one might guess, it is harder to make profits in a time a stagnant energy and resource consumption rates, and in the face of that slowdown or stagnation, profits can be maintained with the sacrifice of wages. The HARMONEY model suggests this might be what happened to U.S. labor starting in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Yes Ronald Reagan was elected President and he was a “union buster”, but we might also ask about the forces that propelled Reagan (and other business friendly legislators) to office and supported a reduction in labor-friendly policies.
Insight #5: Evolution of Economic Structure and Complexity
In a 2016 paper (pre-print and blog) I tracked the changing dynamic structure of the U.S. economy since 1947 using (information theoretic) metrics that quantify the distribution of the flow of money within the economy (specifically the input-output “Use” tables). In Figure 9 I show two images that summarize some of the simulated HARMONEY scenarios as compared to the calculations from the U.S. data.
Figure 9a provides two metrics (mutual constraint & conditional entropy) that when added together form a third metric (information entropy) that is plotted in Figure 9b.
Why should we care about these metrics? Many people view information entropy as a metric of complexity. Higher information entropy means higher complexity, where complexity in the economic context means the economy is performing a more diverse set of activities with each activity associated with more equal contributions.
Figure 9. Information theoretic metrics that quantify the internal structure of the economy over time. The data with large red circles and dashed lines show calculations from my previous 2016 paper. The lines without circles are simulated trajectories using HARMONEY v1.1. NOTE: mutual constraint + conditional entropy = information entropy.
Figure 10(a-left) shows that both the U.S. data and the HARMONEY simulations show a counter-clockwise pattern during an expansion (fast-growth phase) that eventually leads to a slower-growth phase (after 1997 in U.S. data).
Figure 10(b-right) shows information entropy over time, and both the U.S. data and the HARMONEY model show three successive trends from increasing to constant to then decreasing information entropy. Importantly (the paper describes more fully) the change in trends in Figures 9 and 10 relate to changes in both (i) the rate of resources (or energy) consumption and (ii) the cost of energy. That is to say there are similar reasons why there are changes in trends in Figures 9 and 10 for both the U.S. economy and the HARMONEY model.
Figure 10. Same as Figure 9 but with added red shaded arrow to emphasize the broad trend.
The comparison on Figures 9 and 10 provides evidence that HARMONEY accurately represents internal changes in structure and complexity of a real-world economy during a growth cycle.
Conclusion & Takeaways
The key takeaways are that both animals and the economy require energy consumption and resource to (1) operate their existing mass and capital, (2) make new mass and capital, and (3) distribute and acquire energy. If you put these concepts into an economic model, as done in HARMONEY, you are a big step towards enabling your model to realistically describe energy-economic interactions. This type of consistent modeling is important, for example, for the modeling of a low-carbon energy transition. A low-carbon transition will very likely require major shifts in economic structure due to shifts (downward) in energy efficiency (think CO2 capture plants) and increase allocation of resources to make new capital (such several terawatts of wind, solar, and battery capacity across the globe). I continue to work on HARMONEY to inform the structural dynamics of economic growth in ways that are not possible using the usual (e.g., neoclassical growth) methods.
How the Model Works
HARMONEY v1.1 is a system dynamics model centered on simulating a set of ordinary differential equations using stock-flow consistent tracking of monetary flows. HARMONEY v1.1 is still a toy model, which is to say it is not yet calibrated (we’re working on it!) to a real economy, such as the United States. Nonetheless, it has critical features and structural assumptions that make it applicable and valuable for comparing its trends to long-term trends in real-world data.
This is to say, an important part of HARMONEY is that it has a conservation of flow principle for both mass (as physical resources, energy or minerals, extracted from the environment) and money (at any given instant flows of money are tracked between firms, households, and private banks). While this idea has been around for many decades, this is still relatively unique for macroeconomic models.
Here are several assumptions in the design of the model that help explain why it can mimic long-term real-world trends relating energy consumption and economic variables
- The resource that supports the economy is a regenerative renewable resource stock, such as a forest.
- Resource (mass, energy) consumption is required for three purposes in the model, just like the real world:
- To operate machines (as fuel)
- To become new machines when they are manufactured (embodied in new capital)
- To “operate” or feed people to keep them alive (as food)
- Money is effectively defined as all of the following
- the compensation labor (workers) receive,
- the profits received by companies,
- money (as credit) is created when banks give loans to companies to invest in capital at levels beyond their profits, and the money is destroyed when companies pay back debt, and

"What would it profit a man to placate a silent and inscrutable God, yet lose his humanity and family in so doing?
More to the point - what parent would ask such a sacrifice of their own children?
Religions on the whole are rife with variants on the same principle - The Creator building the world out of blocks, not liking the end result, breaking everything down and starting again.
This is a Creator that demands immutable perfection and dependence, requiring his constructs to pay homage.
But then there's this whole thing about God the (strict) Father.
As a parent, it is always, always my goal to ensure my children develop their independence. I don't want to tell them why they need me - I want them to go forth and confidently create on their own.
It's more than a little ironic that questions like this are being raised at a time when the world over, people are questioning their confidence in government as unassailable leader. It's a movement we've seen before, but this time, it's even wider-reaching.
Which is why I wonder sometimes if we've got things backwards.

Leave My Dash Cam On Overnight
Having a dash cam is becoming increasingly popular among drivers due to its ability to capture valuable footage during accidents or other unforeseen incidents. While most people use their dash cam primarily while driving, there is a growing trend of leaving the dash cam on overnight. In this article, we will explore the reasons why some drivers choose to keep their dash cams running overnight, along with the benefits and considerations that come with this practice.
Benefits of Leaving Your Dash Cam On Overnight
Leaving your dash cam on overnight offers a range of benefits that can help protect you and your vehicle. Here are some of the key advantages:
1. Capture incidents while parked
One of the main reasons people leave their dash cams on overnight is to capture potential incidents that may occur when their vehicle is parked. These incidents could include vandalism, hit and runs, or break-ins. By having your dash cam running, you can obtain valuable footage that can aid in identifying the culprits and assist law enforcement in their investigation.
2. Monitor your vehicle’s surroundings
Leaving your dash cam on overnight allows you to monitor your vehicle’s surroundings, providing an extra layer of security. You can keep an eye on any suspicious activities or unauthorized access to your car. This surveillance can be especially beneficial for those who live in high-crime areas or frequently park their vehicles on the street.
3. Document wildlife encounters
If you live in an area with abundant wildlife, leaving your dash cam on overnight can provide you with interesting footage of nocturnal animals such as raccoons, deer, or foxes. Not only can this be entertaining, but it can also serve as an opportunity to document the presence of certain species in your area.
4. Protect yourself against false accusations
In some unfortunate cases, drivers may face false accusations for incidents that occurred while their vehicles were parked overnight. By having your dash cam running, you can easily provide video evidence to prove your innocence and protect yourself from potential legal troubles.
5. Improve driving habits
Some dash cams come with additional features that allow you to monitor your driving habits. Leaving your dash cam on overnight enables you to review the footage the next day and analyze any reckless driving behavior or habits that need improvement. This self-reflection can help you become a safer and more responsible driver.
Considerations When Leaving Your Dash Cam On Overnight
While leaving your dash cam on overnight can be beneficial, there are some important factors to consider:
1. Power source
Before deciding to leave your dash cam on overnight, ensure that you have a reliable power source. Most dash cams require constant power to operate, so you will need to connect it to a power outlet in your vehicle or utilize a separate battery pack designed specifically for dash cams.
2. Memory capacity
Extended recording periods may require a larger memory card. Check the specifications of your dash cam to determine the maximum supported memory capacity. If necessary, consider investing in a high-capacity memory card to accommodate overnight recording.
3. Privacy concerns
While monitoring your vehicle’s surroundings is beneficial, it is crucial to respect privacy laws and not invade anyone else’s privacy. Ensure that your dash cam is positioned correctly to capture incidents relevant to your vehicle without infringing on others’ privacy.
4. Legal implications
It is essential to familiarize yourself with local laws regarding dash cam usage. Some states or countries have specific regulations governing the use of dash cams, particularly when it comes to recording overnight. Ensure you comply with any legal requirements to avoid potential penalties or legal issues.
5. Power drain
Leaving your dash cam on overnight may drain your vehicle’s battery, especially if it is an older or less powerful battery. Consider using a dash cam with a low-power standby mode or connecting it to a separate power source to minimize the impact on your vehicle’s battery.
Leaving your dash cam on overnight can provide numerous benefits, such as capturing incidents while parked, monitoring your vehicle’s surroundings, documenting wildlife encounters, protecting yourself against false accusations, and improving your driving habits. However, make sure to consider the power source, memory capacity, privacy concerns, legal implications, and power drain before deciding to leave your dash cam running overnight. Follow local laws and regulations, and position your dash cam appropriately to respect others’ privacy. With these considerations in mind, leaving your dash cam on overnight can enhance your overall vehicle security and peace of mind.",<urn:uuid:5c43c9a3-7f30-4ec6-9cbe-274583f31477>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://cfbaltimore.com/1147/leave-my-dash-cam-on-overnight/,2024-02-20T22:52:58Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9355487823486328,983,0.6990402936935425,1
"If you have already read my
Soaking and Sprouting - Planning my Weekly Menu post, you would be aware for my habit of making menu plans for the week. While cooking a rather quick and a nutritious meal is never an issue for me, what stumps me is not having a plan. I am not among those who can just see their fridge/pantry, conjure up recipes in their head and whip up a meal with ease. I am kinda lost without having a plan and while I could manage with something, it comes with some amount of stress. I love cooking and hence I try to minimize/eliminate whatever is my pain point - hence my diligence with
Weekly Menu planning.
Preparing Weekly Staples
Once the weekly menu is in place, I cook some of the ingredients before hand to save me some time. While I belong to the old school of believing that freshly chopped and cooked food is at its optimal best nutrition wise, I find that few ingredients do not lose either flavour or nutrition with advance prepping. For a vegetarian, Legumes form a strong protein backbone. Hence, these are advance prepped. The picture above shows cooked Moong Dal, Green Lentils, Cannellini Beans, Toor Dal (Pigeon Peas), Pinto Beans, Chickpeas, BLack Beans,
Tamarind Paste and Ginger Garlic Paste.
Important Storage Tip - Before you start
Unpreserved food is prone to harmful bacteria and contamination. Hence care should be taken in handling and storing them in the fridge. Never store them in a open can or in a improperly sealed container. The temperature of your fridge should be at or less than 40F or 4C. Avoid using your hands in cooked food before storing since it increases the chances of spoilage. At the end of the day, your sense of smell and sight is the best judge. If your legumes smell awful, feel slimy
How to Store Cooked Legumes
It is best to store the cooked legumes in the fridge (or freezer) within one hour of cooking. It would have cooled down by then as well. Use a well sealed/airtight container to keep out moisture and other contaminants. I use
Mason Jars for this purpose and they have worked extremely well for me. I have stored legumes with and without liquid. But I find when you are freezing, cooking liquid helps.
How long do the cooked lentils last in the fridge?
I usually cook lentils just enough to last me as per my weekly menu plan. But from my past experiences, I find that my cooked lentils (moong dal, masoor dal, green/french lentils and toor dal) easily last me a week in the fridge. I once forgot to use a little bit of leftover Toor dal and it was its 10th day and found that it was still good to go! I would recommend 1 week in the fridge and about easily for 6 months in the freezer.
How long do the cooked (dried)beans last in the fridge?
I have easily had cooked beans last me 10 days in the fridge. It would probably have lasted a couple of days more but I have always consumed it within that period to know more. So in best conditions, I would say possibly 2 weeks maximum in the fridge (in California weather at least). If you think you need to store more for a longer period, freezing is the best option. Frozen beans lasts very easily to 8 months.
How to ensure longer shelf life of your cooked legumes?
As mentioned earlier, never use your hands in your beans since it helps in multiplying the bacteria easily and thereby spoilage. Use clean spoons if you have to. Refrigerate within 1 hour after cooking. Also, using salt to season your cooked beans acts as a natural preservative and thereby increases shelf life. You can season your dish accordingly later.",<urn:uuid:d88e720f-435d-4120-819f-d6af96678366>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://chefinyou.com/article/how-to-store-cooked-beans-lentils,2024-02-20T23:05:27Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9541935920715332,806,1.3831696510314941,1

NOTE:Don""t use brown or roasted vermicelli.
NOTE: If you want it gluten free,then use rice vermicelli.
NOTE: If you want you can deep fry it,for that don\""t apply oil in mold,just spread the vermicelli in it,in hot oil place it and on medium heat fry it,keep pouring oil in mold,then with tong just pick it twist down wards in Kadhai or Vok,till all oil drops from basket ,then with the help of knife,remove it,when it is still hot,other wise it will break.",<urn:uuid:6e8bc013-b883-472e-8d38-d4f93f058074>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://chefinyou.com/member-recipes/vermicelli-basket/,2024-02-20T21:40:23Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.8747307658195496,326,1.3555290699005127,1

"– Computer viruses are parasitic programs which are able to replicate themselves, attach themselves to other executables in the computer, and perform some unwanted and often malicious actions. A virus is not able to spread itself to another computers, some user actions are needed for it to infect a new computer. Downloading and running software from untrusted sources, inserting an USB drive without a previous scan–remember always disable the AutoRun feature for the drives as CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs– , downloading and running emails or IM attachments even from known persons, can put you in the nasty situation to have an infected computer. Always when you deal with these situations and to prevent computer infections, scan before to run.
The best scanners in my opinion are multi-engine online scanners like virustotal.com or novirusthanks.org. The links of these scanners and many more are on the home page.
The main three features of a virus are :
– the replication mechanism search and find other executable files in your computer, check if the files are already infected–it has a special mechanism for that and if the file is clean then append itself to the file. It can append to the front, middle or end of the executable file thus changing the file size. This is also the reason why the number of new created viruses decreased in the last years, the AntiViruses has a very simple mechanism for “checking and compare” the files size –checksums at different period of times and a file bigger in size than at a previous date is a sign of infection.
A special category of viruses are “Bacteria” viruses, they replicate themselves so quickly and in a such percentage that the harddisk will run very soon out of free space.
– a trigger is designed to activate a task of the virus, as displaying strange messages, deleting files, sending emails, begin the replicate process or whatever the programmer write in his malicious code. The trigger can be a certain date in calendar–formerly know as Time Bombs, the time when some event occur, opening a certain program or other users actions. The trigger is very important for the virus spreading, because once infected the user will notice nothing strange in his computer, and will continue to spread the virus without to suspect anything. Other reason of this delaying of infection symptoms is for viruses to hide its tracks, the user simply does not know when and how it get infected.
– the task or “payload” can differ from inoffensive ones like displaying joke messages, to deleting or editing important system files like hosts file , deleting or editing registry entries, sometimes making the computer unbootable.
Using polymorphic engines, the viruses change the “virus signature”–their binary code each time when they infect a new computer making very difficult for AntiViruses to detect them using traditional “signature based” scanners.
Macro Viruses can attach themselves to the executable portion of a spreadsheet documents in AutoOpen, AutoClose, AutoExit, or other file macros. The words processors are the most affected by these viruses, so to prevent the computer infections, always perform an AntiVirus scan for documents received as emails attachments, or received by another methods from another computers.
– Computer worms are a special category of viruses with a very important feature added : they can spread themselves between computers, without the user interaction, exploiting some networks vulnerabilities or facilities as network shares or remote file executions. It’s recommended by some experts to disable the Windows Remote Assistance feature, seeing this as a possibly vulnerability. Once it infect a computer it looks forward for other computers connected to the network–LAN or Internet continuing to search for possibly victims.
– Trojans are malicious executable files, masquerading as beneficial programs and tricking users to run their code. Very often they are embedded into other programs as setup or installers file and shared into the forums or blogs as pirated software(warez), so when the user run the installer of a program, the trojan will run in parallel infecting the computer. It’s a server-client software and once infecting a computer, it gives to the hacker where it connects the full power over the computer.
The hacker can see screenshots of the victims computer, can see the webcam in real time, can download and upload files or run other malware.
They are very trendy in nowdays and deserve a special attention, so a more detailed description of this type of malware will be given in the part 2 of this article.
– Spyware is a malicious code able to gather private data from an infected computer and send it to the hacker. The data can be passwords, credit card numbers, login credentials and other private data. They accomplish their mission by using various mechanisms for decrypting passwords previously saved in web-browsers, keyloggers or screenshots.

On the drawing board: During my apprenticeship I spent time in the Jaguar Chassis drawing office, working for the late Stan Paskin, on ABS systems and suspension components, before moving to the Body Drawing Office where I focused on production detailing and full size car body layout.
Working on design submissions from Bertone and Guigiaro in the mid 70s exposed me to the new concepts end of engineering and I began to look for a way to get more directly involved.
After 10 years in engineering I took six months out to consider my next career move. Travelling for several months across the Amazon in South America I made a documentary about life in the rainforest, painted and sketched trees and buildings and made the decision to return to the design side of the automotive industry.
Working in the design studio after a background in body engineering and production meant I approached design from the point of view of manufacturability above everything else.
Development of magic marker rendering techniques, heavily influenced by the artwork of George Thomson and Roger Zrimec: The ""underlay"" for this sketch was based on a CAD print out of the XJ40, with a model standing in front of the car scaled at 5'8"" tall.
Group B Jaguar racing car project: developing the design in M.I.R.A.'s moving ground wind tunnel rig, simulating negative pressure (downforce)
under the car with single and double diffusers, and through calibrated model radiators.
The key stages of the design process that we were involved with were concept sketches, engineering feasibility, aerodynamic evaluation, presentation models and photography. This was the meat in the Product planning/Marketing sandwich . . . .
Launch my first series of Limited Edition prints in 1989, the Ground Level Collection, using styling studio marker techniques and featuring Porsche and Ferrari sports cars. Advertising in several car magazines, the prints sell world wide!!
Investigation into using CAD for design as well as Engineering. Using Computervision visualisation tools to create dramatic
on screen images.
Fact finding mission to Wavefront in Santa Barbara in 1988, on behalf of Jaguar and Computervision, to look at their high end rendering tools; taking with me some sample CADDS4X models. As my first real exposure to the design software industry, this visit was instrumental in my decision to move into the computer graphics industry.
Using Alias Studio V3.0.1 design software, it is possble to replicate Sir William Lyon's creation of the Jaguar XK120 by creating
cross-sectional profiles and blending the body surfaces through them, in real time!! Finishing off with a photo-realistic rendering.
Design consultancy for various companies including Reliant, DCA and TWR Jaguar Sport, using marker rendering techniques.
Launch second series of Limited Edition prints in 1992, the Classic Evolution series; each print is a visual portrayal of the evolution of each of these famous racing cars.

Complete a Jaguar Retrospective in 2021, drawing some of the secret projects I worked on in the 80s that never saw the light of day.

"Rare it is to witness the birth of a classic. Presumptuous it is of me to think that this new cocktail I've concocted will become a classic, but, I rather like it, and I have high hopes for it. I've even decided to call it by my own name: The Talcroft. Here is the recipe.
1 oz quality Vodka
1/2 oz Gin (I prefer Bluecoat American)
1/2 oz Dry Vermouth (I prefer Noilly)
1/4 oz Averna Amaro Siciliano
1/4 oz Malibu Coconut rum (but see below)
Combine ingredients in a mixing glass with ice. Stir until thoroughly chilled. Strain into a well-chilled martini glass. Garnish with a paper-thin wheel of lemon.
This drink, like a classic Manhattan, perfectly balances the sweet and the dry, and spicy herbal flavors (in this case, the gin and the dry vermouth) with the sweet and the exotic (the Averna and the coconut rum). In short, it is a delectable opposition of disparate flavors. Making cocktails, I've decided, is very much like painting, but it's an exercise in painting with flavors rather than colors and textures.
Important note: the proportions above assume the use of the very distinctively flavored Bluecoat gin. A more neutral gin might require using a little less vodka and a little more of the gin. (The Bluecoat is delicious in martinis, too).
I imagine this drink could be made with a coconut-flavored vodka instead of the coconut-flavored Malibu rum, but I don't want to buy a whole bottle of coconut vodka just to try that out, and I suspect that using only coconut Vodka would make the coconut flavor too strong. The thing to remember is that the coconut should be in the background; its presence should be just apparent. It should be the sort of flavor that sends the mind searching for a name--something familiar but not immediately obvious. It should add an element of mystery rather than make a statement.
[Update: I bought a bottle of Bacardi Coconut Rum following this post and compared it to the Malibu Coconut Rum. The latter seems coarse and excessively sweet in comparison. I tried the Talcroft using the Bacardi Coconut Rum and it results in a drier, altogether more subtle drink. I would now recommend making this drink using Bacardi Coconut Rum rather than the Malibu Coconut Rum.]",<urn:uuid:7170b0d3-ee7c-4b0f-a9aa-25a8de8c7a49>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://colintalcroft.blogspot.com/2012/02/miscellaneous-yet-another-new-cocktail.html,2024-02-20T22:18:54Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9347419738769531,511,0.8926901817321777,1

"For those unfamiliar with Cornish, it is classed as a p-Celtic member of the family of Celtic languages, which was once spoken across much of Europe, and is now restricted to the insular world and Brittany: the only surviving languages being Cornish, Welsh and Breton (all p-Celtic), and Manx, Scots Gaelic and Irish (all q-Celtic).
The relationship between these two branches is illustrated by p-Celtic words such as peduar W and their q-Celtic equivalents: cethar [Ir].
The etymology, morphology, syntax and phonology of Cornish and the other Celtic languages ultimately derive from a putative proto-Indo European or proto-Celtic language or family of languages spoken in Britain in pre-history.
Cornish Onomastics is the study of onomastics (personal name data) and toponymics (place name data) in relation to Cornwall in the Early Medieval Period (350 CE to 1000 CE). These names are almost completely in the Cornish language (the Brittonic used in Cornwall and a relative of Welsh and Breton.
Sometime before C6 the closely related South-western British and Western British languages started to look less like Gaulish and more like the modern p-Celtic languages, and Cornish, Welsh, Breton and Cumbric (extinct) began taking shape as modern European languages. Cornish and Breton (from South-western British) eventually diverged from each other during the last part of the Early Medieval Period.
There will have been dialectic differences in these regions of Brittonic usage as well as differences in naming practice between them, but the structure and many name elements of Early Cornish personal names broadly follows that of early names found in Britain, Ireland, Gaul and Celt-Iberia. It is these names that have come down (with modification) to Cornish today including well known names such as Arthur, Gerent and Winwaloe.
Cornish is one of the oldest indigenous languages of Britain, with its roots stretching back thousands of years and to the first settlements of Britain (believed to be the Late Neolithic, when farming was established).",<urn:uuid:884ad21f-b27f-4e51-bc59-b8f46710aea0>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://cornishonomastics.net/2021/07/16/werwerewr/,2024-02-20T21:24:14Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9605072140693665,459,3.962344169616699,4
"Now also available in a limited-edition 2022 ""shit mix‚ÄĚ colored vinyl edition for all of you distinguished aesthetes out there.
In 2016 year of our lord, it's almost unfathomable that this rare beast could have once stalked the face of the earth. But when I need a real social palette cleanser, I turn to the late 80s GG Allin stuff. And this motherfucker is top of the pile, one of the filth-king's rattiest and nastiest albums. The fifth album from Allin and originally released on Gerard Cosloy's Homestead Records, Freaks captures the beast during my favorite period of his career: with this particular expression of his monstrous Id, Allin enlisted the talents of Bulge, who otherwise belched out a couple of rippin' thrashcore releases on Ax/ction and Fudgeworthy in the early 90s, and who featured members of Gonkulator, Jesus Chrust, and Psycho. Bulge's drummer Charlie Infection had already previously worked with Allin by including the song ""I Wanna Suck Your Cunt"" on the Welcome To Ax/ction Island compilation. Bulge was a relatively tighter, more ""stable"" band compared to Allin's previous backing group, so the team-up made sense.
That said, this album is a warzone: a pitch-shifted GG lays down the law with the spoken word intro ""My Revenge"", then throws us headfirst into a nineteen-song orgy of drug-damaged blues riffs and monstrously fucked-up hardcore punk. His vocals sound totally scorched here, like the man has been swilling gasoline in between vocal takes. ""Be My Fuckin Whore""' offers a litany of degradation and misogynistic abuse set to primitive hardcore, with some almost Greg Ginn-level guitar warp going on when it rips into a solo, followed by the thirty-second noisecore-esque blast-chaos of ""Suck My Ass It Smells"". ""Dog Shit"" delivers what is possibly my favorite line from the guy, ""...Get the fuck outta my bread line..."", and that general mean-spirited, ragged hardcore attack makes up the bulk of Freaks.
Other scorchers include sickoid mid-tempo rippers like ""Anti Social Masterbator"" (sic)and ""Last In Line For The Gang Bang"" that collectively climb right into your head and won't leave. You've got a nod to David Allan Coe via ""Outlaw Scumfuc"". And with the messed-up and overtly brain-damaged moments like the lumbering, tuneless skull-beating on ""Wild Riding"" and ""Crash & Burn"" , Allin and crew puke up a kind of Flipper / Kilslug / Black Flag-style scum-dirge that's swarming with gruesome guitar skronk, grating atonal synthesizer, go-nowhere sludgepunk riffing, and some of the more unsettling and orgasmic vocals we've heard from Allin. Goddamn awesome stuff. The closer ""My Bloody Mutilation"" is a drawn-out, industrial nightmare, a fog of clanking, metallic atonality and tortured invective screams, raving madness set to a oily black shimmer of deformed ambience, almost Abruptum-like in it's sheer abject hideousness. But if I had to give you just one reason to pick up this atrocity, it's the song ""Die When You Die"" (actually itself a sort-of cover of Destroy All Monsters's proto-punk classic ""You're Gonna Die"" ), a perfectly formed piece of anti-social, anti-human punk rock that has gone on to be covered by countless punk and black metal bands in the decades since. It's one of the greatest Allin songs of all time.
Bottom line is this- fans of fucked-up and demented 80s' hardcore who haven't heard this stuff are missing out. This is hanging out on the most terrible fringes of hardcore. The height of anti-social art-psychosis and chaos-invocation in the latter half of the 1980s. The Freaks album could sit nicely alongside other albums that I would term ""outsider hardcore"", in spite of some probable pushback from members of the punk scene. But GG and the Bulge beasts were not interested in working within the parameters of the then-current hardcore scene. This is so much more transgressive, more bizarre, more genuinely deranged and incontrovertibly misanthropic, more dissident and self-destroying in every possible way. Allin himself considered this album to be one of the best of his career. A sodomatic , Dionysian immolation rite, pursuing ultimate physical transcendence in a manner not unlike the Aghori sect. And man, nobody ever came close to hustling the way that GG did. It's a sight and sound to behold. Everyone else was performing theater. This was the real deal.",<urn:uuid:dde969c8-73b2-4bb9-b4e2-d33d43867811>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://crucialblastshop.net/album.php?ID=9805,2024-02-20T23:30:29Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.94516921043396,1048,0.745959997177124,1
"Waldo Lake sits in the Oregon Cascades about 40 miles southeast of Eugene. It is in the National Forest so other than some campgrounds there is no development. It will close in a couple of weeks for the winter. At 5400 feet it gets a bit nippy at night this time of year. The lake has been determined to be the 2nd clearest in the world behind Lake Baikal in Russia. The clarity is due to the fact that there is no run-off from the glaciers on Diamond Peak you can see in the distance. The source is precipitation, local drainage and groundwater that seeps in from the eastern side of the cascades. 5 miles long and about 2.5 miles at the widest point. It is deep. Maximum is about 420 feet and the average is 125 feet. On a previous visit a couple of years ago the Oregon State University marine science department was there when we were and ran a routine clarity test. A white disk 150mm (6"") diameter is lowered until it can't be seen. On that day the number was 120 feet. With a turn-over rate of almost 40 years the system is fragile. After a bunch of politics the state was able to close the lake to all internal combustion engines a few years ago. These photos were take on a dead still morning about 8:00. The silence is intense. The only ripples were the ones I made with my paddle.
Below is a shot taken in about 10 feet of water. It is a bit disorienting to be paddling in 20-30 feet of water with a clear view of the bottom. When it is this calm you feel like you will fall off your boat to a hard landing. Once you get into deep water the water is a color of blue that is hard to imagine. Sort of a cobalt like the darker blue some swimming pools are painted only it is alive.

"Democracy is in trouble. No matter what index you look at, the number of countries rated as being fully democratic has declined dramatically over the last twenty years. Worryingly, this trend shows no signs of abating. Some measures even suggest that a greater number of countries became more authoritarian in 2022 than in any year since 1990. If the decline of democracy continues at the present pace, less than 5% of the world’s population will live in a full democracy by 2026. This process has had tremendous consequences for those living in backsliding states, including greater censorship and human rights abuses. It also represents a challenge to countries that remain democratic, which increasingly risk finding themselves isolated in a predominantly authoritarian world. Given that autocracies are more likely to trigger conflicts, spread disinformation, and engage in cross-border cyber-attacks, this represents an existential threat to democratic life.
Understanding why this process is taking place could hardly be more important. Yet current discussions have often been hampered by what we call the “temporal fallacy” – the tendency to view a series of different processes as being essentially the same because they happen to be occurring at the same time. In the case of democratic backsliding, the large number of countries that have moved towards authoritarianism across the globe has naturally encouraged the perception that this trend must be motivated by a common set of developments. Partly as a result, a great deal of media and policy analysis – and some academic work – appears to assume that autocratization is the same everywhere, and hence that a similar set of responses can be used to fight back. Not only is this wrong, it is dangerous. Misdiagnosing the problems facing democracy, and inappropriately applying one-size-fits-all solutions, will undermine efforts to reverse the repressive tide.
Understanding democratic recession in comparative perspective
The need to understand backsliding in comparative perspective, and to recognise the different drivers in different regions, is one of the reasons that we have launched the Centre for Elections, Democracy, Accountability and Representation (CEDAR), an interdisciplinary and cross-regional research network, at the University of Birmingham. Bringing together quantitative data, comparative analysis and in-depth country and regional knowledge is the only way to develop a more nuanced and accurate picture of what is happening to our world. More specifically, it reveals that there is a tendency to place far too much emphasis on factors that are particularly relevant in high profile countries – such as the rise of populist leaders in Brazil, India and the United States – and to overlook issues that are of greater importance in less well known countries, such as the erosion of democratic institutions by established incumbents in Bangladesh and Benin.
The importance of bringing out these regional and sub-regional variations is well illustrated by the recent experiences of North America and sub-Saharan Africa. Common explanations of backsliding in the United States have focused on the (assumed) negative impact of globalization and waning ability of citizens to die wealthier than they were born, which along with a growing lack of political tolerance and a surge in misinformation on social media has facilitated the rise of right-wing populist leaders. One reason that there has not been greater resilience against this trend, some have argued, is that Americans have become apathetic about democracy – in part because it is so long since they experienced the downsides of tyranny. The natural response to these diagnoses is to promote economic policies that both protect citizens from global competition while enabling them to improve their lives. Doing this while strengthening dialogue and facilitating activities designed to foster greater tolerance and mutual understanding – and a belief in the value of democracy – can reduce the opportunities for populist demagogues.
This diagnosis and response makes sense for established democracies where voters are angry that successive generations are no longer living wealthier and more rewarding lives. But it is deeply misleading for countries that do not fit this profile. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, there were only a handful of established democracies at the start of the backsliding trend, and there is limited evidence that class mobility has fallen. As a result, autocratization has not been driven by the emergence of right wing populists, who have defeated centrist governments by using polarising language and strategies. Instead, incumbent leaders and parties who in many cases have been in power for decades – as in Cameroon, Uganda, Zimbabwe – have further eroded key democratic institutions. In most of these countries this process has not turned democracies into non-democracies, but rather has seen states that were already fairly authoritarian become even more repressive. The challenge in Africa is therefore not to prevent the rise of populist leaders. A much bigger issue is how to strengthen democratic institutions that have always been weak and vulnerable to subversion.
Similarly, democratic backsliding in Asia has not all been about the rise of populist strongmen, such as India’s Narendra Modi or Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. Gradual erosion of democratic institutions in Indonesia and South Korea under President Park Geun-hye, civil society repression in Bangladesh and military coups in Thailand and Myanmar have been defining features of backsliding – and sometimes even breakdown – in this diverse region. China’s increasing assertiveness and power further compounds this problem, offering Asian autocrats like Cambodia’s Hun Sen a level of protection from outside pressures with its no-democratic-strings-attached approach to economic development. Meanwhile, China’s own success in achieving relatively high levels of economic development while further centralizing power under authoritarian one-party rule has offered an attractive alternative to Western liberal democracy for many autocrats both inside and outside of Asia. The region also has a very different story to tell where popular attitudes to democracy is concerned. As in Africa, where the authoritarian trend often runs against the grain of popular opinion and is often challenged by popular protests, large sections of society in many Asian countries have mobilised for greater freedoms. Recent examples include Hong Kong, Myanmar, South Korea and Thailand – where a pro-democracy party made history by winning the most seats in the recent legislative elections. These examples demonstrate that the battle over democracy is far from over in Asia, and highlight the extent of variation within each world region, as well as between them.
Latin America provides yet another variant. Between 2000 and 2015, democracy was more widespread in the region than ever before. The process of rising repression therefore started later than in some other regions, and has been characterised by a cycle of political instability, economic stagnation, and corruption scandals. In this context, actors promoting autocratization have gained considerable strength inside and outside presidential palaces. In the worst cases, which are predominantly located in Central America – including El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua – weak democratic institutions have been further undermined in recent years. Sometimes using anti-systemic rhetoric, many of these leaders used public safety concerns and accusations of criminality (against the opposition, against civil society …) as a pretext to erode the powers of other branches of government, restrict freedoms, and weaken the opposition, often with the support of the countries’ entrenched elites. Yet in large parts of South America, societies so far have been able to resist those forces of democratic subversion, despite the real challenges they pose, including in the dramatic episodes in Bolivia, Brazil and Peru. Democracy has thus been left damaged but not defeated, an important reminder that we should constantly probe the evidence that authoritarianism is on the rise, and remember that this trend is geographically uneven. In the Latin American case, political turnover remains high and the region still has some of the most democratic countries in the world, including Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay.
If there is a “temporal fallacy” in explanations for autocratization across the globe, in Central and Eastern Europe there is also a representational fallacy. Researchers – and in particular those looking for an example from this part of the globe – take developments in the two prominent cases in the region, Hungary and Poland, as somehow representative. The authoritarian playbook of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has certainly been influential, and was to some extent subsequently applied in Poland, where the undermining of formal institutions like the judiciary, were combined with criticisms of opposition voices, the thwarting of the media, and the politics of identity. But beyond Hungary and Poland things look rather different and this is particularly important because the region’s less studied cases often provide clues as to how autocratization can be decelerated, halted or even reversed. The role of civil society demonstrations in Slovakia, new political parties in Slovenia, and presidential candidates drawn from non-political backgrounds in the Czech Republic all point to both the potential instruments for ensuring democratic survival, but also additional threats and challenges. Democracy may not be the only game in town in the region, but at least not everyone is losing.
We need to talk about backsliding …
The recent experience of Africa, Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe demonstrates an urgent need to rethink how we are approaching democratic backsliding in at least four ways. In addition to being more empirically careful about where is and is not experiencing authoritarian regression, we should work more comparatively to reveal the different constellations of factors that are driving political change in different countries and regions. Avoiding the temporal fallacy will also require us to rethink backsliding conceptually, moving away from this homogenising terminology to emphasise a wider range of terms that capture what we are seeing – such as gradual democratic erosion, rapid authoritarian shocks, and autocratic hardening – more precisely. Only once this is done will we be in a better position to rethink backsliding reactively, moving beyond the standard “medicines” for democratic maladies that have often proved unable to stem the rising authoritarian tide. The formation of CEDAR represents the commitment of the University of Birmingham to supporting this process, and to play our own part in the development of a more imaginative and flexible toolbox of strategies that is up to the task of protecting civil liberties and political rights in 2023 and beyond.

"Science Fiction writer William Gibson said “The future is already here, it’s just not widely distributed.” When you look around you can see the truth of that statement. Most of the technologies that will influence us over the next few decades already exists. In many ways it feels like we’re living in parts of that future. We can 3-D print replacement jaws for people. And 3D printing was invented over 30 years ago. In NDRC, where I work, we have companies working on embedded sensors for post operative bleed detection, and working on helping kids with focusing and ADHD problems through neuro-feedback game play.  In many ways technology is enriching our lives. In reality the title of this piece is less ‘Our Algorithmic Future’ than ‘Our Algorithmic Present’.
As a technophile that’s very exciting. I have a deep and abiding love of science and the wonderful possibility of technology. I grew up reading Isaac Asimov (his science and his fiction), Arthur C Clarke and Carl Sagan. And watching Star Trek, Tomorrow’s World and other optimistic visions of technology and the future.
At the same time there is a darker side to technology. Paul Erlich said “To err is human, to really foul things up requires a computer.” It’s not hard to find examples. California released 450 high-risk, violent prisoners, on an unsuspecting public in 2011, due to a mistake in its computer programming. ‘We-connect’ an app based vibrator which captures the date and time of each use and the selected vibration settings, and transmits the data — along with the users’ personal email address — to its servers in Canada “Unbeknownst to its customers” a number of whom are now suing the company.
And most dark of all is the case of the firing of elementary school teacher Sarah Wysocki by Washington DC Public schools. The school system used “VAR”, a Value Added statistical tool to measure a teacher’s direct contribution to students test results. Despite being highly regarded in classroom observations the low score from the algorithm led to her being fired. There was no recourse or appeal. And no way to really understand the working of VAR as they are copyrighted and cannot be viewed.
There is this abstract notion of what the computer said or what the data tells us. Much as the complex gibberish that underlay the risk models of economists and financial services companies in the run wasn’t questions (because maths) the issue here isn’t the algorithms as much as people and their magical thinking.
I came across this quote from IPPN Director Sean Cottrell, in his address to 1,000 primary school Principals at Citywest Hotel in 2011. He commented
‘Every calf, cow and bull in the State is registered by the Department of Agriculture & Food in the interests of food traceability. Why isn’t the same tracking technology in place to capture the health, education and care needs of every child?’
Well intentioned as it might be, this shows a poor understanding of cows, a worse understanding technology and dreadful misunderstanding of children and their needs. I find this thinking deeply disturbing, and profoundly creepy so I decided to unpack it a little.
Then I realised that we are already tracking children.
Only its not the Primary Principles Network that doing it, it is private companies doing the tracking and tagging. It is Google and Facebook and Snapchat, with some interesting results and some profound ethical questions. We now know that Instagram photos can reveal predictive markers of depression and that Facebook can influence mood, and peoples purchasing habits.
Our algorithm present is composed of both data and algorithms. We have had an exponential growth of processing capability over the last number of years, which has enabled some really amazing developments in technology. Neural Networks emerged first in the 1950s dimmed in the late 1960’s, reemerged in the 1980s and has taken off like wildfire in the last few years.The Neural Network explosion is down to the power, cheapness and availability of GPU’s, together with improvements in the algorithms themselves. And Neural Networks are really really good at some kinds of pattern analysis. We are getting to a point where they are helping radiologists spot overlooked small breast cancers. 
There is also a very big problem with algorithms. The problem of the Black Box. The proprietary nature of many algorithms and data sets mean that only certain people can look at these algorithms. Worse we are building systems in a way where we don’t necessarily understand the internal workings and rules of these systems very well at all.
Black boxes look like this. In many systems we see some of the input and the output. But most is not only hidden its not understood. In a classic machine learning model. We feed in data and apply certain initial algorithms. Then we use it prediction or classification. But we need to be careful of the consequences. As Cathy O’Neill cleverly put it Donal Trump is an object lesson in Bad Machine Learning. Iterate on how crowd reacts to what he says and over optimise for the output – Classic problem of Machine Learning trained on bad data set. We need to think about what the systems we’re building are optimising for. 
George Box said that “All models are wrong but some are useful.” Korzybski put it more simply “The Map is not the territory.” And its important to remember that an algorithm is a model. And much as the human mind creates fallible biased models we can also construct fallible computer models. Cathy O’Neill put it bluntly that “A model is no more than a formal opinion embedded in code.” The challenge is that the models are more often than not created by young white males from an upper middle class or upper class background. It is not that human brains are perfect model makers but we spend a long time attempting to build social processes to cope with these biases. The scientific method itself is one of the most powerful tools we’ve invented to overcome these biases.
As we unleash them on education, (Sarah), Policing (pre-crime in chicago) and health and hiring we need to be aware of the challenges they pose. Suman Deb Roy has pointed out
Algorithmic systems are not a settled science, and fitting it blindly to human bias can leave inequality unchallenged and unexposed. Machines cannot avoid using data. But we cannot allow them to discriminate against consumers and citizens. We have to find a path where software biases and unfair impact is comprehended not just in hindsight. This is a new kind of bug. And this time, punting it as ‘an undocumented feature’ could ruin everything. 
Bernard Marr illustrates this with an example
Hiring algorithms. More and more companies are turning to computerized learning systems to filter and hire job applicants, especially for lower wage, service sector jobs. These algorithms may be putting jobs out of reach for some applicants, even though they are qualified and want to work. For example, some of these algorithms have found that, statistically, people with shorter commutes are more likely to stay in a job longer, so the application asks, “How long is your commute?” Applicants who have longer commutes, less reliable transportation (using public transportation instead of their own car, for example) or who haven’t been at their address for very long will be scored lower for the job. Statistically, these considerations may all be accurate, but are they fair? 
There is an old saying in tech: “GIGO: Garbage In Garbage Out” the risk now it that this will will become BIBO “Bias in and BIAS out”
As we gather vast amounts of data the potential for problems increase. There can be unusual downstream consequences also the opportunity to create perverse incentives. We are embedding sensors in cars, and looking the idea that safer driver will be given better rates. The challenge is that personalised insurance breaks the concept of shared risk pools, and can drive dysfunctional behaviour. Goodhart said “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” We had a significant recent Irish example with crime statistics where the CSO pointed out problems with both the Under-recording by police of crime and the downgrading of a number of reported crimes. 
At one level I see our future as a choice between, Iron Man – technology to augment, or Iron Maiden – technology controlled by a few that inflicts damage on the many. Technology to augment or to constrict . Technology changes that threaten the self also offer ways to strengthen the self, if used wisely and well.
It is clear that technology does not self-police. We could cut off the use of phones in cars using technology – so it can’t be used while driving but the companies doing so currently choose not to do so
In Europe we have our own bill of rights – a charter of fundamental rights enshrined in the Lisbon treaty and it guarantees “Everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.” This right has been used to challenge the export of data from the EU to the US under the Schrems decision of the European Court of Justice. 
My belief is that we need to extend these rights in the algorithmic era. We need to create a “Charter of Algorithmic Rights” For our algorithmic age. Not a Magna Carta which really just enabled the lords against the king without much for the the peasants. We need algorithmic rights, of the people, by the people and for the people.
Simply put we need airbags for the algorithmic age. For decades cars have safer for men than women because the standard crash test dummy tests on male size standard and biases the development of safety towards the average male. As I said, technology is not self policing. 
We are going to have to create better tools. We need to be able to detect, and correct bias and to audit and ensure fairness over a simple move to efficiency. Or else we are tying things together in unforeseeable ways that can have profound consequences at the individual and societal level. Tools such as Value in Design and Thought experiments help. But we need to go much further.
Kate Crawford writing in Nature says
“A social-systems analysis could similarly ask whether and when people affected by AI systems get to ask questions about how such systems work. Financial advisers have been historically limited in the ways they can deploy machine learning because clients expect them to unpack and explain all decisions. Yet so far, individuals who are already subjected to determinations resulting from AI have no analogous power.” 
While this is necessary I don’t believe it’s sufficient. We need a “Charter of Algorithmic Rights“. While looking to the opportunities they can afford we need to recognise the biases and limitation of technology. What appears to be augmentation may not really be the case. It may restrict and rule rather than enable.
We need to ensure that are tools are creative and reflect the diversity of human experience.
We are better managing them than being managed by them in our algorithmic future.

"Good to see the boys take the first two in San Francisco. The wins haven’t come easy (big thanks to Andres Torres for getting thrown out trying to score on a pitch in the dirt with Pablo Sandoval up representing the tying run to end the seventh in Tuesday’s 5-3 victory), but at least they’ve come.
Heath Bell (2 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 1 K this series) is scaring the heck out of me. Oh, you’re in the market for an All-Star closer? Never mind; in that case, he’s awesome and worth whatever you can afford.
I’m not much for rumors, but Bell has to go, right? For as much fun as it is to think that the Padres are only 8 games back in a lousy division, last I checked, that’s good enough for a 0.3 percent chance at the playoffs.
Bell is eligible for free agency. The Padres aren’t going anywhere and have a deep bullpen. Writing… Wall…
If what Washington received for Matt Capps at last year’s deadline is any indication (it’s a big if; every market is different), the Padres should be able to land a B-level prospect for 2-3 months of Bell’s services.
Who? What? Where? Strength up the middle is always nice (especially with the playing portion of former first-round pick Drew Cumberland’s career apparently drawing to a close), although presumably you have to take the best available talent and worry about the rest later.
I haven’t studied the current market or historical trends in closer valuation. Anecdotally, it seems that more often than not, someone is willing to pay a decent amount for a pitcher of Bell’s caliber and pedigree.
Other trade candidates? Ryan Ludwick and Chad Qualls, maybe Mike Adams (although Adams should have considerable value to his current employer and is best kept unless someone gets stupid with an offer). The Padres gave up a couple C-level prospects to get Ludwick and can expect to get roughly the same in return: warm bodies in exchange for a little salary relief.
I sold the first car I ever owned — a mid-’70s Datsun 710 — to a mechanic for $42. He only wanted the tires but offered to tow the car off the lot at no charge. I got to eat a burger and play some video games, he got tires. It worked out well for everyone.
Like Ludwick, Qualls doesn’t figure to fetch much either. I don’t know what the going rate for generic middle relievers is these days… $42 and free towing?

Third basemen are advancing. James Darnell has been promoted from Double-A San Antonio (where he was hitting .333/.434/.604 in 346 PA) to Triple-A Tucson, with Jedd Gyorko moving up from High-A Lake Elsinore (where he was hitting .365/.429/.638 in 382 PA) into Darnell’s old spot.
Batting cleanup for the T-Padres, Darnell went 3-for-5 with a double in his July 4 debut. Gyorko is 3-for-9 with a double in his first two games with the Missions.
One of Darnell’s new teammates, Kyle Blanks, continues to obliterate PCL pitching. Blanks is hitting .411/.477/.884 in 107 PA since being promoted, which makes him the hottest thing to come through Tucson since… Anthony Rizzo.
Speaking of Rizzo, his struggles (.178/.318/.342 in 88 PA, 29.5 K%) have led to speculation that a return trip to Triple-A might be in order.
No. This was the deal. We expected Rizzo to face an adjustment period and we were willing to live with it. Well, now we’re living with it. Granted, that’s not as much fun when it actually happens as when you say “we’ll live with it,” but there you go.
Meanwhile, Blanks would seem to be a logical candidate to see action in left field if Ludwick is moved. Aaron Cunningham makes sense, too, although the organization appears to view him as more of a spare part.
* * *
The Dodgers are in full free fall. They’re 11 games out of first place and three games back of the Padres. I want to beat them (and everyone else, for that matter) every time, but to watch that franchise self-destruct… it’s painful and embarrassing to baseball, in a Jeffrey Loria kind of way.

This is a great company! John is incredibly knowledgeable and patient with explaining the whole process from design through delivery and follow-up up service. It's been a few years since our family had installation and went live with net metering.
Earth Wind and Solar Energy was very helpful and still is to this day with ongoing support and a recent upgrade we did to our system. They deliver top-notch, leading-edge technology with a simplified design and the most competitive price. They were more competitive than 3 other offers and even more competitive than a solar company I was contracted to work for. Their technical expertise and long-term experience in the industry also stood above the rest.
I can't emphasize this enough as the process can be complex both technically and financially if you don't utilize a trusted and experienced company. When it comes time to connect and deal with net metering, Riana is brilliant. She is the consummate professional, and business leader with all the back-end support, permitting, paperwork, etc.
They also have a great team of technically competent installers and electrician making the process so seamless. Finally, they are locally owned and offer ""Midwest nice"" service. Our neighbors also had their solar done by John and referred us.
I fully and wholeheartedly recommend Earth Wind and Solar Energy for all your energy needs and know you will be completely satisfied with the experience and savings!

"It is now perhaps a commonplace that digital, networked and informational media are extremely transient. They diversify in form and function at a dizzying rate. At the same time, they transit and fuse “social” and “natural” differences in a manner which reconfigures all the worlds involved. It is also perhaps a commonplace to suggest that some established powers have found it difficult to come to grips with this (although this is perhaps beginning to change). For many, from seriously challenged newspaper proprietors to established media disciplines, it might be time to pause for breath, if only for a moment—to regroup and adapt established practices and ideas, to count the survivors from among the old media worlds of just a few years ago.
While occasionally sympathetic, this issue of the Fibreculture Journal questions this approach. If we pause for breath, it is to take in the new air. This issue draws on the accelerated evolutions of media forms and processes, the microrevolutions in the social (and even the natural sciences) that dynamic media foster, even the way in which “new” media lead us to reconsider the diversity of “old” media species. Summed up simply here under the sign/event of the “trans,” this issue catalyzes new concepts, accounts of and suggestions for new practices for working with all these processes.
We hope that as they meet, the ideas and practices discussed here become joyfully invested in something like a wave of ‘speculative pragmatism’ (Massumi, 2011a; see also 2011b). This issue diffracts something of this wave, embracing and thinking through what must be embraced and thought through, establishing new forms of critique, or new forms/concepts of design, in order to infra-act with the emergent worlds of contemporary media. It rethinks the forces and ephemeral forms of digital and networked media via a “radical empiricism”. Relations and dynamic ecologies come first, before fixed forms and established disciplines or business models.
If we sometimes turn to the past in this issue it is to follow Foucault’s very well known suggestion that ‘power is not homogeneous but can be defined only by the particular points through which it passes’ (Deleuze, 1988: 25). In the passed, there is a—
… certain form of local and specific struggle whose relationships and necessary unity could no longer come from a process of totalization or centralization, but rather, as Guattari put it, from a transversality. These two aspects, the practical and the theoretical, were closely linked. (24)
Several articles deal with this question of local and specific struggles in what we might call the ‘trans-situational’ (Massumi, 2002: 217) diagram of power (here power meaning as much what is capable of being done as what constraints or formations might surround this).
The first article in this issue, Petra Gemeinboeck and Rob Saunders’ ‘Other Ways Of Knowing: Embodied Investigations of the Unstable, Slippery and Incomplete’ perhaps captures everything that this issue was intended to be. It aims for a ‘politics of transmateriality’, not only in theory but in a series of practices/artworks. These works include highly original robotics pieces in which somewhat “neurotic” robots find themselves in a situation which is quite literally ‘unstable, slippery and incomplete’ (thus the robotic neurosis that arises). In Zwischenräume [In-between Spaces], a robotic installation still in the making, ‘a group of autonomous robots punch holes into the walls’ of a gallery ‘to inspect what’s outside, signal each other, and conspire’.
Kristoffer Gansing, in his ‘The Transversal Generic: Media-Archaeology and Network Culture’, ports François Laruelle’s concept of the generic into a testing of the limits and movements of media archaeology. He suggests there is now a ‘generic archaeological impulse’ that is often key within the use of media, and that this means “new” media are increasingly concerned with pasts, not the future. This—along with its ability to rethink media definitions, relations and actual instances with an archaeologist’s attention to specificity—perhaps makes the emergence of media archaeology so important. Yet Gansing suggests that the take up of the ‘generic archaeological impulse’ in general culture (and as part of contemporary Capital within the cultures of digital and networked media) also leads us to question some aspects of media archaeology from within. In the process Gansing discusses a number of key media art works (such as Google Will Eat Itself). He also provides a fascinating thinking through of that most humble of media technologies, the overhead projector.
Michael Dieter takes on the question of struggle, the local and transversality quite directly in ‘The Becoming Environmental of Power: Tactical Media After Control’. In an extremely subtle reading of both Foucault’s security dispositif and De Certeau’s concept of ‘practices’, Dieter provides a welcome rethinking of priorities of relation between strategies, tactics and general politics, insofar as these involve tactical media. The stakes are high. Dieter contextualises media-related activism within ‘what Brian Massumi has described as the globally amplifying threats for large-scale disruption characteristic of the becoming environmental of power’. He aims to give ‘a different conceptual approach for critical media art projects in terms of ontopolitical problematics’.
In ‘Programmable Platform? Drupal, Modularity, and the Future of the Web’, Fenwick McKelvey gives a detailed account of the modular nature of Drupal, alongside an account of Simondon’s concept of information. McKelvey explores the nature of the ‘programmability’ of platforms such as Drupal, and of ‘programmability’ in general. He does so via a consideration of both his general commitment to FOSS and one specific instance of this at the juncture of the technical and the social—an internship at Rosario, Argentina with a women’s rights organization in the city.
All the articles in this issue of the Fibreculture Journal give voice to the transformative nature and powers of contemporary media’s new worlds and engagements, even as these so often stutter and stumble. This issue critically explores the specific dynamics of digital, networked and informational media in the light of the constant transformations, micro and macro, that are these media’s very power, if also their difficulty. The articles address these media’s own ecologies of ongoing transformation, and/or their co-evolution with other worlds (social and political worlds, natural worlds, the worlds of science, or art, of pleasure, of philosophy and theory).
To give this precision, we sought articles for this issue, theoretical or analytic, critical and/or propositional, that engaged with contemporary media worlds within the parameters (or “conceptual parametrics”) of three concepts: transduction, transmateriality, transversality. We began from the assumption that the lifeblood of digital, networked and informational media is to be found in transductions (the relay of forces, for example in a corkscrew, in the modulation of a video signal by audio data or in the formation of a crystalline structure) (Mackenzie, 2002 and Shaviro, 2006). ‘Transmateriality’ is a term recently developed by Mitchell Whitelaw—one that allows us to think very specifically about the complex yet insistent materiality that works within transductive events, including those involving contemporary media, which are so often seen as somehow only immaterial. If computing allows for an ‘incredibly dynamic, pliable set of techniques for manipulating the material environment’ (Whitelaw, 2009), then transmateriality suggests ‘the extension of transduction to an understanding of the material relations and transformations involved in a computing immersed in the material world’. In this, computers are taken to be ‘material machines dedicated to propagating a behavioral illusion, or call it a working model, of immateriality’ (Kirschenbaum, 2005; see also Kirschenbaum, 2008). ‘Transmateriality is an attempt to “ground” the digital without losing sight of its (let’s say) generative capacities’ (Whitelaw, 2009). Through all this runs an obvious transversality, from which it seems much of contemporary culture, and some of media disciplines and industries, tend to run but from which they cannot hide. ‘Transversality’ is a transformative mobility—for better or worse—through different systems (that can be at once technical, but also social, political, natural). It could be seen perhaps something of a conceptual or pragmatic choice (to think or act ‘transversally’). So it has something of an ethical dimension. However, it also makes an onto-genetic claim: to think or act transversally is to more effectively immerse ourselves in the kind of ongoing and real onto-genesis that is the world. Transversality tends to be lateral, rather than hierarchical—or rather it eschews, as it undoes, both the vertical and the horizontal. A transversal connection does not just connect fields or sets of pre-existing relations. It transforms the things/events that are brought into connected networks.
All these ‘trans’ indicate events that are at once material, technical and social. This issue did not require submissions to engage with the thinkers behind these ideas. Rather, transduction, transmateriality and transversality were meant as catalysts for experiments in radical empiricism, for immersions in the dynamic relations that distribute themselves within new media worlds.
Yet part of this catalysis of radical empiricism has involved important and detailed accounts of key concepts and thinkers of things “trans”. John Tinnell’s ‘Transversalising the Ecological Turn: Four Components of Felix Guattari’s Ecosophical Perspective’ is a more than timely and thorough account of the ecosophy of Félix Guattari. Tinnell suggests that Guattari’s work on ecosophy has been strangely neglected at times, as has its relation to his also strangely neglected work on ‘post-media’. Thinking these together gives us a different understanding of ‘transversality’, one that might help accomplish the now crucial task of thinking environment and media ecologies together. Tinnell suggests that ‘Guattari’s conception of post-media is true to his idea of the “new aesthetic paradigm”, which, at a basic level, involves the explosion of artistic techniques and mentalities into arenas of social practice and institutional politics’. By ‘taking a post-media stance towards emergent media, we can think the new and think it collectively, but only to the extent that we develop digital practices capable of producing a new (ecosophical) relation between individual subjectivity and the collective thought’ and, of course, the environment.
Gilbert Simondon’s work is taken up by several articles in this issue. Simondon’s work on transduction and individuation is finally being taken up on a larger scale within thinking on a range of media and other issues. So we are pleased to provide what we think is an important contribution to this taking up of Simondon’s work, here in thinking about media issues. In a dramatic and original rethinking of the interaction design of what they call ‘interactive environments’—Christoph Brunner and Jonas Fritsch’s ‘Interactive Environments as Fields of Transduction’ effectively transversalises interaction design. They move what is already a dynamic field of work beyond the phenomenological, embodied interaction, and certainly many of its previous more cognitivist theoretical iterations (as useful as all these might be). In doing so, they move interaction design towards a consideration of field as such. They discuss Rafael Lozano-Hemmer’s artwork Voz Alta, and an interaction design experiment they themselves undertook, Impossible Room, in order to lay out a radical “template” for rethinking the very nature of interaction design. As part of the basis for this template, they detail Simondon’s thinking on information, emotion and more.
Simon Mills’ ‘Concrete Software: Simondon’s mechanology and the techno-social’ gives a detailed account of Simondon’s often ambiguous relation to the social. Mills rethinks Simondon’s better known work on the associated milieu and concretization via the lesser known work on human cultural progress in ‘The Limits of Human Progress: A Critical Study’ (Simondon, 2010). He analyses the Foreign Exchange Market and the Twitter API in glorious detail along these lines. Mills’ important and different understanding of Simondon and the social makes room for Simondon as a thinker who allows us to ‘capture the reality of the ongoing operation’ of ‘recursive relations’.
Troy Rhoades, in ‘From Representation to Sensation: The Transduction of Images in John F. Simon Jr.’s ‘Every Icon’, gives a highly precise and detailed account of a specific series of occasions of transduction, between art and science, in John F. Simon Jr,’s well-known internet art work. In the process Rhoades allows us to rethink while maintaining the relations between science and art, and gives what has to some extent been a missing account of the “body” and the “thing”, as these concepts were deployed by Deleuze and Guattari in What is Philosophy?. This allows us to rethink body and thing, and art and technology in terms of transduction.
Vince Dziekan’s ‘Anxious Atmospheres: the Transdisciplinary Practice of United Visual Artists’ rethinks the transdisciplinary—especially as this works, in both practice and theory, between traditional arts such as architecture, design and electronic arts. Dziekan has a specific interest in ‘reinterpreting the aesthetic conditions associated with exhibition’. He gives a detailed account of the way in which London-based art and design practice United Visual Artists, or UVA, create responsive installations that bring alive the transdisciplinary (along with a rich transversality and transmateriality).
In thinking through various events as “trans”—via the concepts and practices associated with transduction, transversality, and transmateriality, the issue first argues for the urgency and necessity of taking the complexity of transversal events and relations into account at the junctures of technology, the social and the environment. Second, the Trans issue gathers what is effectively a new wave in thinking about media differently, particularly about the way that digital and networked (although not only digital and networked) media further, complicate and sometimes simply allow us to understand and engage with things/events that are “trans”.
Each of the articles in the Fibreculture Journal 18, Trans issue demonstrates that any individual/individuating/social or natural ecology is to some extent a network, and any network involves an ecologies of transversals. Crucially, the micro-reconstitution of relations is as important as, if not more so than, the macro-reconstitution of somewhat illusory states (see Fuller, 2010; Murphie, 2006; Raunig, 2008).

"The Atlantic Alliance of Montenegro organized a conference on the topic “The truth at the time of disinformation – how vulnerable and how do we fight?” At the “Center Ville” hotel in Podgorica.
The conference began at ten o’clock, and Savo Kentera, president of the Atlantic Alliance of Montenegro, opened the same speech and greeted all participants.
“Disinformation is just one of the instruments for implementing strategic foreign policy interests as well as strengthening the international position,” Kenter said, and called on US Ambassador to Montenegro Judy Rising Reinke to address a few words.
“It’s a pleasure to be here in this program of the Atlantic Alliance. I would like to thank the Atlantic Alliance, especially Mr. Sava Kenteri in partnership, to organize programs such as those aimed at educating people in Montenegro and beyond, “the ambassador said.
In the further part of the conference, through panel discussions, panelists talked about the experiences, lessons learned and importance of strategic partnerships in the fight against disinfection in the first panel.
The panel moderator was Savo Kenter. Milan Jovanović, from the Atlantic Alliance of Montenegro, presented the two case studies with the presentation of the importance of true news. After him, Chris Donelly, director of the Institute for Statecraft in the UK, spoke. He talked about his work experience, about developing democracy as the main actor in reducing misinformation, that is, “the truth instead of false news”. “The world is changing at a rapid pace, faster than ever in the last 200 years,” said Donelly.
After a short break, another panel was held within the conference.
The panel’s moderator was Marko Savić, a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Political Science, and panelists were Mihailo Jovović, program director of ND Vijesti, Božena Jelušić, literary professor, and Draško Đuranović – director and editor-in-chief of the Pobjeda list.
The theme of the panel was: “Media literacy as a driver of social resilience to threats brought about by disinformation”.",<urn:uuid:bfec6658-d827-4f01-8243-343e5295fafd>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://english.mladiinfo.me/conference-named-istina-u-doba-dezinformisanja-held-in-podgorica/,2024-02-20T22:05:27Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9567258358001709,471,1.5637197494506836,2

"I needed a horse day this month. A day to just be with horses, connecting and healing. After spending the day soaking up horse energy, I brought my camera out as the sun went down.

Culminating Performance. All Arts/Literacy units culminate in a student performance in front of an audience including at least students and teachers.
Return to Text. At various points during the unit, Arts/Literacy classrooms return to the original text to deepen student comprehension or writing development and to evaluate literacy learning.
Teachers and Artists as Collaborators. The teaching team of teacher and artist co-plan and co-teach the unit, actively facilitating daily classroom activities.
Students as Artists. Performances draw on students’ skills, knowledge, and culture in a student-centered environment where the students become actors, writers, and directors.
Experience Live Theater. Visiting professional theater performances inspires the students to set a high standard for their own performances. It also creates a common theater language and experience for the teacher, artist, and student, providing a glimpse into the vocation and culture of the professional artist.
Reflective Practice. Teachers, artists, and students reflect on their own teaching and learning on both a daily and a unit level and discuss ways to improve their work.

MSU faculty contribute to dairy encyclopedia
MISSISSIPPI STATE -- Got milk questions? International experts including several Mississippi State University faculty members provide answers about dairy science ""from paddock to plate"" in a newly released encyclopedia.
John Fuquay, dairy science professor emeritis at MSU, is one of three editors for ""The Encyclopedia of Dairy Sciences,"" an extensive and authoritative source of information on the subject. The Major Reference Works Division of Academic Press is publishing this first-of-its kind, four-volume collection of 427 articles. The dairy science encyclopedia is part of a series of encyclopedias, others of which focus on food science, microbiology, meat animal science, reproduction and other topics.
Fuquay found authors for the dairy production portion of the encyclopedia and edited their work included in the volumes. He also wrote a chapter on the effects of heat and stress on reproduction. Other contributions from MSU's Animal and Dairy Science Department include Peter Ryan's article on labor and delivery in dairy cattle, Terry Smith's article on feeding dry and newly lactating cattle and Scott Willard's article on reproductive cycles in seasonal breeders. Retired MSU professor Joe Bearden contributed an article on leptospirosis.
Additional MSU faculty contributing to the book include Dr. Richard Hopper of the College of Veterinary Medicine, who submitted an article on external parasites related to mange, dermatitis and dermatosis on dairy cattle. Charles White, professor of food science and technology, wrote an article on the handling, storage and transportation of raw milk.
The primary audiences for the encyclopedia are researchers, educators, dairy company managers, dairy Extension personnel, dairy consultants, undergraduate and graduate students, people involved in economic and nutritional policymaking, and the media.

MSU veterinary student wins national scholarship
MISSISSIPPI STATE – A Mississippi State University veterinary student interested in bovine health recently won a national scholarship.
Matt Mundy, a third-year student at the MSU College of Veterinary Medicine, received an American Association of Bovine Practitioners’ Amstutz Scholarship. This is the first time an MSU student has received this prestigious award.
Mundy received his bachelor’s degree in animal science from MSU in 1996. After graduation, he worked for Aesland Farms in north Mississippi before embarking on a career farming cattle and row crops. His experiences owning, operating and managing a large cattle operation led him to shadow veterinarians and ultimately return to MSU to pursue his doctor of veterinary medicine degree.
Canadian-born Mundy grew up in Carrollton, Ga., but plans to return to Canada after graduation, as he has already secured a job with Metzger Veterinary Services in Ontario. He intends to be a food animal practitioner and focus on the health of feedlot cattle.
“My family has a history of working in the medical field,” Mundy said. “My dad, granddad and uncle built great reputations by caring for their clients’ individual needs, and I hope to do the same.”
The $7,500 scholarship is named for a leading authority on bovine diseases, Dr. Harold E. Amstutz. He is also known for developing national and international organizations devoted to bovine veterinary practice, including the AABP, which is an international professional organization of more than 6,000 veterinarians specializing in bovine medicine.",<urn:uuid:22721f04-656f-4645-8ed8-e4f94cbd2dc2>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://extension.msstate.edu/news/feature-story/2012/msu-veterinary-student-wins-national-scholarship,2024-02-20T21:17:35Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.967206597328186,406,1.5132755041122437,2

"Speaking of exotically named desserts [my post on kouign amann] I had some friends over for a very informal evening and decided to make a cherry clafoutis [Slate] as an easy but tasty dessert. Came out well, I think, nicely in between being cakey and custardy. And of course this is getting to be a great time of year for local cherries.
In reading more about them I came across a sort of cousin from Brittany (clafoutis comes from Limousin [Foodreference.com] in south-central France) called a ""Far Breton.""

"The Advantage of Linux
Setting up Apache
Starting and Testing Apache
Recently an article was published in Linux Gazette entitled Web Page Design Under Linux. This article produced some criticism in later issues. The main criticism seems to have been of the authors preference for hand coding HTML rather than using a HTML editor like the Windows HotDog editor. This is an argument I do not really want to get involved with. Neither do I want to spend much time on style. Whilst in most cases users want simple fast loading, clear pages, there will always be a place for garish eye candy, huge graphics and all kinds of complexities that take forever to download on a 28k modem. What I do want to address are the great things that linux offers. Great things that are free and would cost a fortune to implement on other operating systems. In particular I shall explain how to set your linux box up to be your own intranet server, and thereby fully exploit the abilities Linux offers for designing applications for the Web.
One point I think needs making, and which does not fit in with the rest of this article, is the Plugger Plug-in for Netscape Navigator. In the past many people have complained that Netscape plug-ins are not generally available for Linux. Plugger from http://fredrik.hubbe.net/plugger.html, seeks to address this by providing support for many audio/video/image types.
By way of introduction though, I will put my two penny worth into the 'editor argument'. I have never yet found a HTML editor that I like! I am writing this article in StarOffice 5.0. I have never used it to write HTML so this is something of a test. I expect I'll have to edit the source when I finish writing. Another editor that seems as good as any other I have tried is the composer part of Netscape Communicator. I find this irritating, very very irritating. Why? Because I like my text to be fully justified. OK I know that some people think that full justification 'goes against the spirit of HTML', but personally I would rather read text that is fully justified than text which is not. I do not believe I am alone in this preference.
What happens with Netscape is that after I have spent a couple of hours designing some pages until I am happy with them, I load them all into vi and change every occurrence of <P> into <P align=justify>, which can take some time if I've written a lot of text. Now a little later I want to make some changes, so I load the pages into Netscape Composer and I make some changes. But whist Communicator understands <P align=justify>, Composer does not. In fact Composer does not allow <P align=justify> and changes each occurrence back to <P>.... Bummer... I have to re-edit all the source by hand again. If I thought there was some advantage to using Composer, rather than hand writing my HTML I guess I would write a little program to search HTML files for <P> and replace with <P align=justify>. But this is not the only short coming of HTML wysiwyg editors. They just don't seem able to do exactly what I want, how I want.
OK in fairness I am now impressed with StarOffice! Although there is no button to give full justification, it is easy to edit the Text Body style so that full justification is automatic. It is also easy to automatically indent the first line of a paragraph, set double line spacing etc. etc. Maybe I will be converted to using a wysiwyg editor for my HTML after all.
One feature that seems to be missing from StarOffice 5.0, is any easy way to define lists. Tables are well supported, but lists are not. I guess that it should be possible to define some new styles to allow the use of different kinds of list, but one would have thought that a button should be available for them. Also given the different kinds of list available for HTML, one might find that the styles menu becomes cumbersome and more difficult than it should be.
OK simple layouts are quicker with a HTML editor, but if you want full control you have to hand edit at some point. So to my way of thinking if you want to write good HTML you must learn HTML. It is a very bad idea to to think you can skip learning HTML by getting an editor that works like a word processor. You will not have the skills you need to produce good web pages. HTML is very easy to learn. Once you know it then you might find that Netscape or StarOffice provide useful tools to help you. But please do not think such tools replace the need to be able to hand code HTML.
The essential document to read if you want to produce great Web-Pages efficiently is HTML 4.0 (W3C: HTML 4.0 Specification), this is the full Document Type Definition for HTML and SGML. For once I have taken my own advice and read it! The problems I mention above regarding text formatting have all been solved for me! I look at the HTML source StarOffice has given, whilst I am impressed, I am not happy. Again I think that an editor like vi or emacs really is better and more efficient than using a wysiwyg editor.
The reason is that HTML 4.0 allows the use of Style Sheets. This article depends upon the use of a style sheet, special.css. This is a document that says how a browser should render my document. An important feature is that browsers that cannot display certain things (e.g. graphics) are not disadvantaged. All browsers can access this page in the way I intend them to. In the past authors have been forced to use techniques to format their pages that cannot be displayed correctly on all browsers. Propriety HTML extensions, the conversion of text into graphics, the use of images for white space control, the use of tables for layout and even the use of programs, have all been used to format text, all these methods cause difficulty for users and extra work for developers. The correct use of style sheets avoids these problems.
Once you are familiar with the use of style sheets, it will not matter how badly Netscape Composer performs, or how unfamiliar you are with StarOffice, using an editor like vi, really can be simpler than using something like Hotdog. Load my style sheet into your favorite editor and see for yourself how easy it is to change the look and feel of this document (this link and the one above are to an identical copy called special.txt, so that you can see the source without the browser parsing it).
Even as I am writing this document, I have found yet another web browser for linux! This one is worh some attention since it is produced by the W3 consortium, the same people who define the HTML specification. In fact this is the browser they use to test their specification. The following text is displayed when you start it for the first time:-
This browser certainly has some advantages. The version I have is still beta (1.3b), so there are some short comings. I found that the File - Open Document dialog can resize its file box so it is non-functional. Also for some reason not all directories can appear in the directory box. At least one can specify the required file in the URL box! The fact that the manual does not come with the package is a definate minus for me.
What is nice about the browser is the pleasent way it renders pages. This page, for instance, uses full text justification, Amaya can actually split words in the traditional manner when required.
The really nice thing about this browser is the fact that you can edit files as you browse them. So if you are creating a document with many pages it is easy to switch between them. The down side of this is that there seems to be no way to to edit or view document source. Something that I would like to see in other browsers is the ability to create a ""Table of Contents"", with Amaya you can generate one based on the <H...> elements in your document. This will pop up as a seperate window and allow you to easily navigate through a document that has no links of its own.
At about 4.5 Megbytes, this is probably a very good alternative to StarOffice if you do not have the disk space required for StarOffice. I am certainly interested in seeing how this browser develops in the future. If you want to give it a try you can obtain it from the Amaya homepage. Additionaly there was a review of an earlier release of Amaya in Linux Gazette some years ago see issue 15. All I have to add to that review is that improvements must have been made. It seems the same in appearence as the screen shots show. Amaya displays the old style of Linux Gazette Contents pages quite well, but the new style in the last three or four issues is completey garbled. When Amaya starts up it no longer looks for a page on its home site, and I have not seen it seg fault as described. On the whole it does a very good job.
Now I've got that out of my system I'll get on to my main point. Drum roll please..... With linux it is simple to build a system you can gain http access to. Trumpet fanfare please.
Even if, like me, you are a stand alone machine, with no kind of network, it is easy to start up your favorite browser and http:// yourself. This means you can get into the wonderful worlds of cgi scripts, client server applications, java. etc. etc. etc. Without the need to access a 'real' network you can test any network application you care to develop for the Internet. You can test every aspect of your web design without wasting a phone bill. You can test applications safe in the knowledge that no matter what mistakes are in your code, only the machine you are using will be at risk, the ""real"" network will be unaffected until you decide your code is working correctly.
Web page design is not just about putting text/graphics and links onto the Internet. Increasingly it is about providing good user interfaces to network applications and providing an efficient means of communication. In the past only the largest corporations could afford to implement a WAN (Wide area network). Today anybody with a modem and pc can join the Internet, or implement their own intranet (a private network that acts in the same way as the Internet).
To illustrate my points consider the following scenario. You own a small tobacconists and live in a village called Tiny. Because the village is small you do not have many customers, so you don't sell items in vast numbers. That means you do not buy in large quantities from your suppliers and you cannot get the kind of discounts larger shops would get. But you have many relations and friends in other, similar villages who also run small tobacconists. If you all clubbed together and ordered your supplies as one entity you could take the discount advantages of bulk buying from your suppliers. The only problem is knowing which shop needs what items at any given time. You know that the discounts you would get would allow you to employ a van driver to deliver to all the shops and still leave each shop a significant saving.
How can web design under linux help you solve this problem?
The 'man with a van' needs information, what to buy in what quantity and where to deliver it. This sounds like a classic database application. Linux offers many sql database solutions. We want to keep costs to a minimum, we also want to maximize security and reliability. So good choices might be ingres or postgreSQL. If we look at these DBMS's we find that postgreSQL comes with a java interface. So lets say we design a suitable database with postgreSQL. This database will be held on a box that will be our server.
What we need is the ability for each shop to communicate with the server to tell it what stock we need to buy in. Shop keepers do not have to be computer literate. They also do not want to spend much money on computer systems. At least at this time it is unlikely that they could be persuaded to learn a UNIX operating system like linux. Cheap boxes already have Windows. An ideal solution is one where each shop can dial into the server, the manager can start up his/her favorite browser and use it to enter information to the server. It should not matter what operating system each shop uses.
What does our server need to do?
The first thing is to get Apache set up and running. Apache is a web server and comes with most if not all linux distributions as standard. What is not always clear is how to set it up correctly. This is something an installation program cannot do (easily) and needs to be done by hand. It is Apache that allows us to http ourselves. Of course, we will also need to allow remote machines to dial into our server, but that is a matter outside the scope of this document.
Once Apache is running we can design a java application to act as a user interface to our database.
We can test both the client and the server parts of our application on our server until we are certain it performs as required.
Then all we need to do is allow the shopkeepers to be able to dial into the server and gain access via their browsers to the java database interface.
The wonderful thing is that at the test stage we only need to use one linux box which acts as both client and server at the same time.
If you do not already know, then Apache is one of the most common http servers in existence. A great many ISP's (Internet Service Providers) use Apache to give their clients (i.e. You) access to the world wide web.
This document does not attempt to address the requirements of a true Internet or intranet server. All I am concerned with here is getting Apache up and running on a standalone machine so that client/server software can be tested. In particular I am not concerned with security issues here. If you do not intend to have a permanent network connection then all should be well. If you intend other machines to have access to your http server then you should read all the relevant documentation. Complete configuration of Apache can be a very complex issue which does not fall within the scope of this document.
Modern Linux distributions, such as S.u.S.E., have special requirements for setting up Apache correctly. To avoid confusion please read the documentation that came with both your linux distribution and your Apache distribution. The following steps will work for any Linux distribution, but be warned, if your distribution has special requirements I cannot be responsible for getting your system startup files in a mess.
For instance I shall describe how to start Apache automatically at boot time by adding a line to your /etc/inittab. Whilst some Slackware users will benefit from this approach S.u.S.E. users should find that it is better to edit their /etc/rc.config file in the appropriate manner.
These steps will prepare your machine for the installation of Apache. You might find that Apache is already installed, following the above steps will not hurt such installations.
127.0.0.1 localhost 127.0.0.2 Hawklord.Varteg Hawklord
ALL: 127.0.0.1 ALL: 0.0.0.0 ALL: localhost ALL: Hawklord.Varteg
If Apache is not already installed, find a pre-compiled version and install it as per the instructions. You should find that configuration files are placed under /etc/httpd, and other files are installed under /usr/local/httpd.
The directory /usr/local/httpd/htdocs should contain the Apache user manual in html format. Actually this directory will become the root directory of our http site, so you may want to move this documentation elsewhere eg. /usr/doc/Apache.
When you log into a http site, eg http://linux.org, you find yourself at the root of what can be a very complicated directory structure. You can think of a http site as being a file system just like your own root file system. Whilst it is true that to a user the http site will look like a regular file system, the reality on the servers hard disk(s) can be very different. It is important to understand the differences and use them to your advantage.
On my system the document root is at /usr/local/httpd/htdocs, and this is the directory a user lands in when they access http://Hawklord.Varteg. But there is only one file and no sub-directories on my hard disk. I only keep index.html in the physical location /usr/local/httpd/htdocs. All the documentation users can access is held in other locations on my hard disks.
Looking again at /usr/local/httpd you should find other sub-directories, in particular cgi-bin and icons. These directories should seem to be located under your document root because they will contain files that should be available to any html file on your site that requires them. Though a user should not be able to directly access these directories. Much of my documentation is under /usr/doc, so I make that directory appear as /doc to the http server.
What this means is that you can store all your documentation on the server in locations that seem logical to you, you do not need to copy files or even make symbolic links to /usr/local/httpd/htdocs. Instead plan how you want your documentation to appear to a user. Also you can have directories that users cannot directly access, but which html documents can access.
For instance, the directory /usr/doc/ contains
Linux_gazette Howto Ldp java-documentation
I also want to access files under /usr/hobbies/literature and /usr/src/java/applets
I want my site to have the following structure:
/ ---> cgi-bin docs ---> Linux_gazette Howto Ldp java-documentation literature icons java_applets
Planning your http site in this way will save you headaches in the future!
/etc/httpd/httpd.conf is the main configuration file for Apache. Some versions of Apache and/or Linux distributions recommend that all configuration information is kept in this file. Other versions recommend that you use all three files I shall mention below. If you want to keep all information in one file, simply put all the information in one file, there is no real difference between the two methods. You will find that the example files will contain sufficient comments to enable you to make the best choices for your system. I am only going to describe the changes you need to make to get Apache to work for you. Careful reading of the files will let you configure Apache better for your needs.
I am aware that a TCL configuration utility called Comanche exists for Apache. However, this is still in an early stage of development, so I do not recommend it for beginners. I found in practice the utility would not function correctly if you use only httpd.conf to configure your system. However it could prove useful for experimenting with different configurations.
For each line in the configuration files you can assume that your example file has a correct or sensible entry, unless I specifically mention it. Back up the examples before you make any changes!
This file contains site specific information. It is where we define how our site will look to a user.
Alias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin/ Alias /docs/ /usr/doc/ Alias /docs/Linux_gazette/ /usr/doc/Linux_gazette/ Alias /docs/Howto/ /usr/doc/Howto/ Alias /docs/LDP/ /usr/doc/LDP/ Alias /docs/java-documentation/ /usr/doc/java-documentation/ Alias /docs/literature/ /usr/hobbies/literature/ Alias /icons/ /usr/local/httpd/icons/ Alias /java_applets/ /usr/src/java/compiled/
This file contains permissions for our sites directories. If. when you test your configuration by starting httpd and pointing your browser to (eg.) http://Hawklord, or http://localhost (both will work for the above example), you get a file access error you will need to alter this file. Each directory in your site should have its own entry.
By default Apache has a very restricted set of permissions for the root directory, I have found that changing to:
<Directory /> Options All Order allow,deny Allow from all Options FollowSymLinks </Directory>
solved some problems for me. It is important to realize that a directory inherits its permissions from its parent directory. So if you want to allow outside access to your site you need to take great care when setting up your directory permissions.
Once you are satisfied that you have correctly installed and configured Apache, you will want to test it! Log into your machine as root. At the prompt type:
#: httpd &
Now you can log into your machine as any user, start your favorite browser and enter the URL http://localhost. If all goes well you should load the Apache site file index.html. That is unless you moved the Apache documentation and provided your own index.html in /usr/local/httpd/htdocs
Once you ar satisfied that all is well, you will want to have httpd start at system boot time. Some Linux distributions, such as Red-Hat or S.u.S.E. will have a script to start Apache in their init.d directory. If this is the case then you just need to enable the script for sys V init in the normal manner.
As an alternative you can put the following line in your /etc/inittab
'ap' must be a unique identifier. '45' refers to the runlevels for which the command will be executed. Once is probably safer to use than 'respawn', since if there is a mistake in this line you will see a lot of error messages ;-(
The final part of the line '/bin/su --command=/usr/sbin/httpd', is intended to start up Apache as a process owned by wwwrun. It would be wise to test this command before you put it in your /etc/inittab.
If you have Apache running, and a large linux installation, then you might want to consider implementing a search engine. S.u.S.E. Linux provides htdig, in fact to gain full benefit from the S.u.S.E. Help System you need to use something like htdig. The only problem is the disk space you will need. I have a 1Gig partition devoted to documentation, this may seem a lot to many users! I have a lot of personal documentation, program documentation (increasingly this is HTML), all issues of Linux Gazette, Gimp documentation, java documentation etc. This takes about 500 Meg. The database htdig uses is between 200 - 300 Meg on my system. To update the database I need 200 - 300 Meg spare under /tmp. Actually when I update the database I change the location of /tmp since I do not have enough space on my root partition. Now since I have arranged all the documentation to be available to Apache, it is all referenced in htdig's database. If I have a question about any aspect of linux, or any of my personal subjects, all I have to do is formulate a suitable search pattern. I cannot adequately describe the savings in time this has given me! In the past I would have needed to access newsgroups to find answers to my problems. With htdig I can avoid this 99.9% of the time! Given the low cost of hard disk space, the fact that current program documentation is usually given as html, that most documentation of any kind is available as html, then it makes good sense to use Apache in conjunction with a search engine in order to have a most efficient information retrieval system.
Htdig may not be perfect, if you are used to Infoseek or lycos, it is a bit annoying because you cannot search for a phrase e.g. ""starting the x server"". Rather a document is searched for that contains all the words you enter. An advantage is that related words are searched for as well, e.g. if you search for 'god' you can also get results for 'gods' and 'godly'. Once you get used to htdig it becomes an indispensable tool. The time it saves you in looking for information is well worth the cost in terms of disk space. (on my system the real cost is about 250 Meg, though I need another temporary 250Meg when re-building the database).
Finally I shall mention Linux's SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) support, this is not normally concidered part of web page design since most home users will simpy want to be able to create their own HTML home pages and have no other use for such documents.
However, a great many people will want to produce documents in many formats. The same document might need to be available for publication as a book, or as an info page as well as being available as web pages. The linux documentation project contains many documents that are available in different formats according to users needs.
SGML allows a single source to be used to produce many different kinds of
text format. The following package descriptions are taken directly from
the S.u.S.E. 6.0 distribution, though they should all be available for
I have no real experience with SGML so I will leave the appraisal of these packages to the reader. For some people these will prove indespensible tools for
producing HTML pages.",<urn:uuid:43239e63-93a0-4feb-b684-c6e27cf4ffc5>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://ftp2.de.freebsd.org/pub/linux/misc/gazette/issue43/gibbs/Web_Design.html,2024-02-20T22:39:31Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9338597059249878,5420,1.9987233877182007,2

"Making the news this week is one Julian Assange of Wikileaks who was arrested by London police this Thursday after Ecuador waved his asylum they had previously granted. Assange long a thorn in the side of US intelligence services faces extradition to the United States of America where a sample charge of attempting to hack into US Defence dept. computers and obtain classified material, more serious charges are likely to be brought after extradition.
What to make of Julian Assange and Wikileaks ? Whistleblower ? Frontman ? Truth outer ? Journalist ? Guess it depends on what side of the fence you are on. He published a account of War Crimes committed in Iraq , US state Dept diplomatic cables to their embassies across the world, an Archive of Hilary Clinton emails however they were obtained. Wikileaks getting involved with USA Presidential election in 2016 was a mistake, no thanks were likely from the Republican party and he irked US intelligence services plenty.
The truth is a scarce commodity with the press- newspapers, TV , radio and online media. Its tends to be half the story a lot of the time, omission and out and out lies quiet a lot do. The establishment won’t be long in “shutting you up”.. they will dig dirt on you, invent it if necessary and there is always out and out intimidation and murder.
Mr Assange made himself a target and they concocted a rape charge in Sweden to “get” him. One wonders if Mr Assange knew the risks of what he was doing and if his sponsor will be able to “protect” him from lengthly incarceration and possible execution. They will have to make quiet a fuss to protect him. Truth is scare but needs telling, possibly from people like Julian Assange.

"Regulations that prohibit new public infrastructure in hazardous areas keep utilities, roads, fire stations, police stations, and other infrastructure out of areas that will be impassible during storm events and/or will need regular repair. These regulations can also be written to discourage further development in hazardous areas. Communities should plan ahead for future infrastructure needs (e.g., schools, police and fire stations), especially in areas of new growth, to ensure that such infrastructure can be sited in appropriate locations.
- For a (Massachusetts) example of regulations that discourage infrastructure in the floodplain, see the Cape Cod Commission’s Model Bylaw For Effectively Managing Coastal Floodplain Development (PDF, 1.1 MB), which stipulates that no new or expanded non-water dependent infrastructure shall be placed in the coastal high hazard zone. This zoning bylaw allows roads and driveways only if they are of “minimal legal and practical width where there is no alternative means of access” to an established development. See StormSmart Coasts Fact Sheet 3, A Cape Cod Community Prevents New Residences in Floodplains (PDF, 5.75 MB) for more information.

"Two days of fishing the Lower Laguna Madre with D.O.A. Lures results in remarkable fishing
Story and photos by Kelly Groce
After D.O.A. Lures creator Mark Nichols, Capt. Andy Salinas, videographer Johnny Lu and myself attempted to each eat a delicious breakfast burrito larger than the size of my head from Manuel’s Restaurant, we hit South Bay in South Padre Island in search of fish.
As Capt. Andy Salinas began to set our drift, I rigged up my go-to lure and color, which is a 4” jerk bait in the color 441 Figi Chix. I swear trout can’t refuse this lure, because it didn’t take long to start catching them. I saw jack crevalle hammering shrimp right behind the boat. I threw my lure towards the disturbance and got to have a fun fight with one. Next cast, a snook came speeding at my lure and my favorite sound on earth ensued… my reel peeling drag. I used 1 lure and caught 3 different species; trout, jack crevalle and snook.
Andy, Mark and Johnny all caught plenty of slot snook, redfish and flounder on 4” shad tails. The tail on those lures have amazing action that fish can’t look past.
We ended the day working a deep channel and catching black drum along the bottom. Between all of us, we caught a Texas grand slam which is a redfish, trout, flounder and snook. Not a bad day of fishing I’d say.
A summertime cold front blew through, so the day started out overcast and on the cooler side. On the ride out, Capt. Luis Flandes III, Mark Nichols, Cindy Nguyen and myself had all agreed that the surroundings looked like a winter day in Texas.
We began fishing a gin clear flat. On Capt. Luis Flandes’ fourth cast he hooked up to a stud 28+ in. trout. He was throwing a 4” jerk bait in the fish catching color 455 Texas Croaker. Winter-like conditions resulted in a trophy trout. After a fish like that, can the day get much better? Why yes it can. We moved to a grassy flat and Luis was plucking redfish out left and right using a Root Beer/Chartreuse jerk bait. Cindy and I doubled up on two pretty redfish, mine being the most orange colored red I have ever seen.
The fishing in South Padre is awesome. To get in on the action contact either one of these great guides, Capt. Andy Salinas or Capt. Luis Flandes III on Facebook. Thanks again for 2 great days of fishing.

"A couple of years ago, I made a Saturn V S-IC pumpkin for Halloween:
This pumpkin is based on actual NASA-produced drawing, (the S-IC diagram from my Saturn V Inboard Profiles). I extracted the appropriate section of the S-IC, removed the captions and identification lines, and created a template. I extracted the silhouette of the F-1 turbine exhaust from S71-41810 (Apollo 15's launch).
If you'd like to make your own S-IC pumpkin, I've uploaded the template I used as a PDF file. Simply scale the file when you print it to reflect the size of your pumpkin. Peel off the skin of the pumpkin on the grey portion of the template to make the darker turbine exhaust.

"Are you happy with your business this year? What are you going to do differently? How can you hire the right people to support your vision? Sadly, many small business owners do not spend enough time planning for the future. It’s quite understandable. Managers must keep pace with the daily demands of their businesses, including payroll, taxes, product/service delivery, and customer expectations.Fortunately, the end of the year is the perfect time for a comprehensive evaluation of your company. Your business needs a checkup. Most people can relate to a checkup with their local doctor, depending on their background and personality characteristics (age, sex, family medical history). The doctor will conduct a variety of tests, including blood, vision, heart, and hearing.In fact, one element like an individual’s weight is not the only indicator of overall good health. Likewise, small businesses could benefit from a good checkup too. Successful entrepreneurs think strategically when engaged in a hostile, global environment.After 27 years of managing projects and conducting over 100 organizational evaluations of business organizations, I realize that both large and small organizations struggle in implementing their operations effectively. This article examines how small businesses need to conduct an effective checkup of their organizations.Welcome to the New Normal! Yet, nearly a year after this pandemic, the full impact on the U.S. economy is unclear. According to recent studies, more than four million Americans have left the workforce, and nearly 10 million are now unemployed compared with last February.In fact, the number of unemployed people continues to rise. According to a business study conducted between March 28 and April 4, 2020, small businesses have been heavily damaged by the lockdowns due to Covid-19.In an analysis of more than 5,800 small businesses (reaching a network of 4.6 million small businesses), the research highlighted the damage caused by the pandemic. The results showed evident damage of the pandemic. At this juncture, 43% of businesses had temporarily closed, and nearly all of these closures were due to COVID-19.Respondents stated that they had temporarily closed, largely pointed to reductions in demand and employee health concerns as the reasons for closure. In fact, the businesses, on average, reported having reduced their active employment by 39% since January.All industries have been impacted. However, retail, arts and entertainment, personal services, food services, and hospitality businesses showed significant employment declines exceeding 50%. Some businesses hope for assistance from the government.According to a Babson’s Goldman Sachs report, 88% of U.S. small business owners have already exhausted their Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan; the Small Business Association gave these loans specifically to help businesses keep their workforce employed during the pandemic. These loans were helpful.Yet, these successes do not diminish the fact that more than 32% of PPP loan recipients already have laid off employees or cut wages. In fact, Forty-three percent of Black small business owners reported that their businesses’ cash reserves would be depleted by year’s end due to Covid-19.Today’s small businesses and entrepreneurs must retool themselves, given the potential impacts of Covid-19 have the necessary capacity to change their way of thinking because of their passion. However, small businesses must be willing to evaluate their current operations and make the required changes.For example, customers have largely gone online to purchase services due to the lockdowns. If a business does not have an online presence now, this company does not exist. Internet pioneer and CEO of PSINet Bill Schrader explains the significant of online visibility: “Almost overnight, the Internet’s gone from a technical wonder to a business must.”With the appropriate diagnosis of an organization, a business can develop more sustainable success. Thus, the right checkup is critical.Below are some critical questions to help you conduct your own self-checkup:
Do you have a clear vision for your business? What is it?
Do you know why your customers buy from you and why others do not buy from you?
What results are you getting from your marketing? Do you have an effective online presence on the web?
Are you collecting data or the right kind of data on your customers and competitors?
Are you keeping pace with your industry trends? If so, what are the key trends?
How are you measuring results (i.e., key performance indicators like cash flow and revenue)?
What are your key competitors’ marketing strategies?
Have you evaluated your strengths and weaknesses (i.e., SWOT Analysis)?
In summary, successful global businesses, like IBM and Google, have continuous systems in place to evaluate their performance. Let’s call this process an organizational checkup.Small businesses that want to succeed in this global and technological climate must be able to conduct this self-evaluation or checkup. This article demonstrated the relevancy of a good checkup to help improve a business by asking probing questions. In many cases, small businesses do not have to take on this organizational checkup along.There are various organizations like the Small Business Administration and local universities that can assist in this process. Have you conducted a checkup for your business this year? It’s not too late. Start the new year with a healthy business checkup.© 2021 by D. D.

"I have a great saying that is great to live by. “In my world everyday is a Friday and I’m always on Vacation!”
I’ve had this saying for years. I am very grateful everyday that I get to live in San Francisco and see the Golden Gate Bridge the minute I walk outside my apartment. Living in SF literally feels like a vacation because everywhere you look people are enjoying the city from all over the world. And I am enjoying it too.
Tomorrow I am going on a family vacation to a tropical island and all week I have been mentally checked out from anything trivial at work. And I’ve found that when I’m in this mindset, everything is trivial.
I’m sure you’ve heard the saying “Act as if”. Act as if you are the king of the world. Act as if you have a million dollars in your bank account. Act as if you are the owner of the company you work for. And of course… Act as if today is Friday and you are on vacation.
Think about how you feel when you leave work on Friday knowing that you are going on vacation. Are you worried about sending that email or giving a status report? Nope! You could care less about work, your boss or anything else that is causing you stress. In fact, you have cared less and less about most things all week leading up to Friday.
And once you are actually in a car, on a plane and finally at the beach your mind is 100% in a different state of mind. What if you could live in that state of mind everyday?
Here are some tips to get into that state of mind…
- Be Grateful: I challenge you right now to take the next 6 minutes and make a list of everything you are grateful for. Your house, family, lunch, phone, love… You live in the greatest time in the history of the world. Be grateful!
- Stop Watching or Reading Any News: With the election and all the other bullshit stories your mind is going to be in a negative state. Negative thoughts are like weeds in your mind. You need to guard your thoughts and a sure fire way to do this is to make sure what is coming in is positive.
- Get on Island Time: What are you in a rush about? Trust me when I tell you that you are going to get everything done today that you need to get done. And if you don’t “No Problem Mon” you can do it tomorrow.
- Screw Email: The only reason you need to reply to an email is to “cover your ass”. Over 50% of email is useless. How do I know this… well how many emails do you respond to on vacation? That is the number you should reply to when you are working.
- Go Out to Lunch with Co-workers: You are not too busy to go out for a nice lunch with your co-workers. I know it will feel strange that you aren’t grinding away answering emails. But it will feel less strange if you go with co-workers because technically you could say you are “working”.
I realize that you are most likely not on vacation right now. You are likely not having a vacation anytime soon and stressed about paying your bills and getting by. But I promise you that you have a great life. There is no reason you should feel better on a Friday than you do on a Tuesday! Think about how dumb it is that people feel differently based on the day of the week. If we are lucky we will live to be 90 years old. That isn’t a lot of time to let the day of the week determine how you fell.
So change your mind right now that “Everyday is a Friday and you are always on vacation”!
Have an Excellent Day!

"Rhetorical analysis is not for the faint of heart. It’s for teachers and instructors who don’t mind students feeling uncomfortable enough to take a risk. Rhetorical analysis has changed everything for me since I’ve brought these concepts into the classroom.
The activity below is used to simply introduce the concept to students using a news article or a simple short text. Once we begin this conversation, their work gets better, they have more passion for analyzing literature, and they have the words to discuss this in-depth conversation.
If you like this activity, check out more of the assignments on Teacher Pay Teacher and see what else might work for your students.
Description of Rhetorical Appeals Activity:
This worksheet is meant to give you a beginner’s knowledge of how to discuss and identify rhetorical appeals in an expository text. Expository texts are any text that is non-fiction: newspaper articles, informational journals, blogs, magazine articles are just the beginning.
Note: At a later time, we can discuss how any types of videos or audio recordings can also be analyzed for rhetoric.
Analyze a newspaper article for rhetoric.
- Students will begin to see that any text can be analyzed for rhetoric.
- Students will have a beginning knowledge of the meaning of ethos, pathos, and logos.
- Print out or find a newspaper article that you are interested in.
- Use the printable to discuss or write the answers to each question one by one. Know that each question will have an answer and each answer might be challenging to find. Look beyond the obvious!!
- Skip any questions that you are really struggling with and come back to them later.
- After you have completed as many questions as possible, go back to the ones you skipped. One that you might struggle with is this: What does the author want you to do with the information? Most likely, he/she wants you to change your opinion on a subject, describe.
- Think about some additional questions about the author: What opinion does the author have about the subject? Who is the audience of the article?
- Now respond to the article with your opinion: Do you agree or disagree with the author? Explain. Would you recommend or mention this article to someone you know? Who and why?
Leave a comment if you downloaded this and completed the activity. Let me know which question you struggled with the most. I do plan to do a short video tutorial on this soon, so any confusion can be answered there if you let me know.

"“Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O LORD, my strength and redeemer.”
…or day. Actually I mean day because though it’s only 11.19 I have been here at Clark forever and am ready to crawl back on the shuttle, slink into the apartment, and curl up on the bed to sleep away my day. Which I find odd, because I went to bed at 11.00 last night; on the other hand it’s not odd because all I’ve eaten today was an English muffin at 7.30, and my body doesn’t have much extra energy stored away for if I don’t eat for a few hours. I think food would help, but here I am trapped at Clark where they sell only the most outrageously priced items – and of course I neglected to bring money with me in any case. Oh well.
I thought on the shuttle over here about why people attend college. Why are you going to college, or why did you? I hear tell that most careers you learn most of the important stuff on the job anyway. Perhaps this is less true than I expect, but my Soc prof talked in class today about that – an odd coincidence? – and suggested that we wouldn’t learn any skills in college. Nothing useful like how to change a car’s tire, what to do if a pipe breaks in the wall, how to unclog a toilet… I don’t know that I agree with her though on all counts: English, well, let’s say I want to be a writer (I do). What exactly will I gain from reading lots of 19th century poetry? Or any historical literature? Maybe I’ll gain an appreciation for “The Classics,” but again, if I want to write excellent and interesting articles about science, how will “The Classics” serve me? I am literally unable to take classes I feel would help my future life, classes about how to write short stories, journalistic articles, and so forth, because Clark’s English program demands so much history I can’t fit any extra stuff in.
I know I say I don’t like poetry very much, but sometimes a good one comes along. Here’s one from William Blake, written in 1794 that I like: Little Fly
Thy summer’s play
My thoughtles hand
Has brush’d away
Am not I
A fly like thee?
Or art not thou
A man like me?
For I dance
And drink & sing,
Till some blind hand
Shall brush my wing.
If thought is life
And strength & breath,
And the want
Of thought is death;
then am I
A happy fly
If I live
Or if I die.
If you read enough of something you begin to appreciate it. I still have many pages of Blake to get through. This semester will really test if I can/want to stick with the English major. Yes, yes, it’s getting a bit late to change my mind, but… We’ll see. I like reading and writing, but at the same time there’s a limit to how much of any one enjoyable activity a person can take. And as I’ve been wondering, if I want to write why don’t I do that instead of burning $30,000 a year on an “education”?
Additional William Blake quotes:
“Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity.”
“A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.”
“He whose face gives no light, shall never become a star.”
“Eternity is in love with the productions of time.”
“The busy bee has no time for sorrow.”
“No bird soars too high, if he soars with his own wings.”
“The most sublime act is to set another before you.”
Sound deep? Don’t get too enchanted, because these are under the section of “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell” called ‘Proverbs of Hell.’ Some of the others are a little more surprising. Take “Drive your cart and yoru plow over the bones of the dead.” Mmmm-hmm, little different feel there, huh?
Been eating a lot, even though it makes me feel kind of sick. I’m trying to “take my medicine” regularly, truly. Generally I’d say life is looking up, not school-work wise, but emotionally and mentally. Blah! Expect to read a lot of poetry or quotes in the future, for that’s what my life will consist of.

"Sweating Nursery Stock
Tree species such as hackberry, oak, and hawthorn exhibit deep bud dormancy and may fail to break bud after planting or have delayed bud break. This problem can be overcome by sweating the nursery stock. Sweating nursery stock should be done inside a building and out of direct sunlight. Put a sheet of plastic on the floor and cover the plastic with a layer of wet moisture retentive material such as sphagnum moss or shingletow. Put the seedlings to be sweated on the material and cover with additional moist sphagnum moss or shingletow. Repeat layers of trees and moisture holding material as needed.

"Oct 16, 2007 Entry Submitted by: Merlin
A few weeks ago a small group and I hiked into Kahana Valley on the Nakoa Trail (marked in blue in image at left). We noticed two other routes off the main loop and determined to return to explore more which we did two days ago. This time we took a route that started near the large cement boxes that are randomly sitting in the valley there (where the green trail meets the blue). The second route (in green) was quite an amazing trail. It started off going through a bamboo forest then it followed the stream cut in the ridge about 80-100 feet above the water. Since it was higher up it offered a great view of the stream and trees and all. It looped around down into the stream and returned through the river bed. No back-tracking on either trail. I have not yet hiked the one in orange . I marked the intersection where the trail starts and then drew the trail in orange of what I estimated it to be from a hiking book description. I aim to follow and mark it with my GPS like the other two. The one in orange goes up a ridge near 1,000 feet elevation and should offer a pretty good view of the valley. The other two loops don't get higher than 380 feet elevation. The picture at left shows the trail from an angle to see the ridge heights, the one below is from top down to get and idea of the trail lengths.
First loop (Blue): 3.2 Miles
Second loop (Green): 1.5 Miles
Great trails all together, it's a shame I didn't explore them sooner. I haven't posted the directions/instructions yet on the Activities page yet - I will once I finish the 3rd loop.",<urn:uuid:03c14ac0-f635-4fae-a28a-481fd4ef5402>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://merman.us/cgi-bin/blog?s=1&pl=kv,2024-02-20T22:37:45Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9667158126831055,361,1.677858591079712,2

"We were recently invited to try out some new Blueberry and Raspberry Upbeat Protein drinks.
What is it?
The new addition, which was voted for by Upbeat’s Facebook fans, is not only flavoursome, it also contains high quality protein which keeps skin and hair looking healthy, perfect for those looking for that summer glow. Protein, as the most filling of foods, is especially important in the morning as it helps set on-the-go people up for the day. And don’t worry..Upbeat won’t make you look like a body builder, though it will help you to resist that mid-morning doughnut!
Low in fat, containing just 150 calories and with half the sugar found in most fruit juices and smoothies, Upbeat is a great option for the health conscious at a time when unhealthy snacking remains high on people’s agenda as they look to get in shape
We really enjoyed sampling them. My other half is always looking for ways to increase his protein intake and I don’t take anywhere near as much interest in my own so it’s really handy to be able to get such a large portion (20g) all in one go. My 3year old also loves them which is great as I find if she has more protein throughout the day that it really helps with her sleep at night.
If you see them whilst on your supermarket shop I highly recommend you give them a whirl. We have also tried out the strawberry which is pretty tasty too.
Blueberry & Raspberry Upbeat is available from Tesco and Holland and Barrett from mid July. Existing flavours of Upbeat are also available from Waitrose, WHSmiths Travel, Ocado and selected petrol stations, RRP £1.79 for a 250ml bottle.

Kallio Church was built in 1908-1912. The design by Lars Sonck represents a change from the National Romantic style to Art Nouveau. Jean Sibelius composed a melody for the 7 bells of the church. The altarpiece was painted in 1956. It is the only church in Finland with both Baroque and French Romantic organs. The seating capacity is 1100.

"Moving to London was my first, and possibly one of the biggest, obstacles that has come about due to my role at the NAO. But it is certainly not something to discourage people from outside of London. What. A. City. They call New York the city that never sleeps but with the night tube our great capital will give it a run for its money. Admittedly, it has been a complete shift in lifestyle – no one travels at a leisurely pace, Monday night is a perfectly reasonable night out, flexible working is encouraged and Citymapper is king. Make the most of the opportunity to live in one of the most vibrant, historic and atmospheric cities the world has to offer.
Onto less leisurely subjects: my portfolio. It has developed throughout the year and now I have a wide variety of projects to work on; even though they all relate to a single client they vary greatly. This has resulted in me leading two separate audit areas; one financial and the other an innovative value for money (VFM) project. This is giving me a wide overview of the department and is allowing me to gain an understanding of the complexities that my client faces on a day-to-day basis.
I have learnt a great deal in my first year and been included in everything the office has to offer; sport, social, work, learning, drinking and eating. I feel like I have finally cracked double entry (I don’t care what anyone says it is not understandable in the first two weeks) and used it to begin my journey working out why we do different audit tests and how they relate to other audit tests someone else has done, seeing what this demonstrates and why it’s important to our opinion.
If you think learning is over when you leave university you are gravely mistaken. There hasn’t been a single day working for the NAO that I haven’t been taught something new, which is fascinating and engaging when lots of roles today have people repeating the same process over and over until they retire. Audit is interactive, divisive and INTERESTING. That’s the real shocker right there. I definitely did not see myself arguing over the necessary double entry for an incorrect journal entry and whether it materially effects my opinion of their financial statements. I didn’t even know what materiality meant before I began at the NAO and now I calculate it, apply it, consider its implications and understand it. Now for the second year, who knows I may even spend my time somewhere more exciting than Southend, but deep down we all know there is nowhere more exciting…",<urn:uuid:189ef752-e8fb-4cc1-9c53-23c0b0834ace>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://naoaccountancyscheme.co.uk/2016/11/11/one-night-on-audit-followed-by-another-364/,2024-02-20T22:15:02Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9646179676055908,533,0.5912008285522461,1

"A few weeks ago I saw a great show of paintings by Annemarie Siefert at Westover School Gallery in Middlebury, CT. It's still running through April 14th if you get inspired to go! Annemarie Seifert's
paintings are vibrant with rich color and masterful in technique. She also
does incredible pastels but these pictures are all of paintings.
This one's called ""The Studio.""
I like the dark rusty colored area around the back of the roof and the way the grey door and it's left-side shadow contrast with the bright yellow wall. Here's a closer view of that part:
Using layers of color to convey shadow and light, her subjects sometimes take on a metaphysical aspect. Below, here's a roadie with ethereal color. It's a big painting which helps convey the massive scale of the road and construction site. It's called ""Bridge 189 at Dawn, NYC.""
I can't forget this cowface pictured below. I've been thinking about painting our dog, Nick. His face conveys a warmth and presence, like he's thinking with his heart. Like this cow. This is a little painting that to me conveys emotionally intelligent warmth. No doubt I am anthropomorphizing, but no matter. We resonate with images like this one because of how they trigger our emotions.
Thanks for looking! If you like these pictures, I have more photos from the show I'm planning to post on Facebook and Twitter so check that out too.
I hope you'll check in next week for more!",<urn:uuid:296547d7-feb2-4675-b675-81d44af148f1>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://news.susannakitson.com/2012/03/annemarie-sieferts-paintings.html,2024-02-20T22:37:40Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9636718034744263,323,1.1826505661010742,1
"Print This Recipe
When I was offered a copy of Rose’s Heavenly Cakes, I jumped at the chance to take it. It’s written by Rose Levy Beranbaum (think The Cake Bible) so I knew would be filled with amazing recipes, and each recipe has a photo which is something I love. I hate not knowing what the finished product is supposed to look like. Another perk–she lists both volume and weight measurements in her cookbook!
I’ve already decided the next recipe I’m going to try is the Apple Caramel Charlotte because it is just so stunning. You can see a short video of Rose discussing her book and basic baking tips here. OK, on to the brownies.
If you’re a chocolate fan then these brownies are for you. They’re rich, yet light and moist and the ganache “plugs” are a delicious treat, but totally optional. If you don’t want to fill the inside with ganache you can always use it on top instead. The original recipe calls for a financier mold, but I used a mini muffin tin and it worked out just fine. I ended up with 24 brownies.
Photos of the process here.
2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
1/3 cup heavy cream at room temperature
2/3 cup pecans, broken or chopped medium-coarse (I omitted these)
9 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, preferably no higher than 62% cocoa mass
6 scant tablespoons unsweetened cocoa, preferably fine quality Dutch-processed (I used Hershey)
3/4 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
2 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
2 ounces cream cheese, cut in pieces
1/2 cup all purpose flour
pinch of salt
Melt the chocolate in a microwave, using 15 seconds bursts on high power and stirring several times, or in a double boiler over hot but not simmering water, stirring occasionally. Add the cream and stir gently until the mixture is smooth and dark. If necessary (if the cream was too cold and the mixture not entirely smooth), return it to the heat until totally fluid and uniform in color.
- Prepare financier molds, preferably silicone (I used mini muffin pans), with baking spray with flour or shortening and flour.
- 20 minutes or longer before baking, set an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 325°F.
- Place the pecans on a cookie sheet and toast them, stirring occasionally, for about 7 minutes or until very lightly browned. Cool completely.
- In a double boiler over hot water or microwave-proof bowl, melt the butter and chocolate, stirring 2 or 3 times.
- Beat in the cocoa, then the sugar, beating until it is incorporated. (If you are doing this by hand, use a whisk.) Beat in the eggs and vanilla. When incorporated, beat in the cream cheese until only small bits remain. Add the flour and salt and mix only until the flour is fully moistened. Stir in the nuts and scrape the batter into a piping bag or freezer-weight zipseal bag. (You can use a spoon but it’s a lot faster and easier to use a pastry bag or zipseal bag with one corner cut.) (I’m lazy and didn’t feel like cleaning the pastry bag so I used a small cookie scoop.)
- If using a silicone mold, set it on a baking sheet and pipe the batter into the cavities, filling them about three-quarters full (1.5 ounces/45 grams in each). With a small off-set spatula or the back of a spoon, smooth the tops.
- Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until the batter has set. The batter will puff and rise a little above the top of the cavities but sinks slightly on cooling. An instant read thermometer should register about 194 F. and if pressed lightly with a finger tip they will spring back.
- As soon as the brownies are removed from the oven, grease the end of a wooden chopstick or dowel (1/4 inch diameter) and insert it into the brownie, at 3 evenly-spaced intervals, all the way to the bottom, twisting slightly as you insert and withdraw it. Fill the holes with the ganache until slightly rounded above the surface of the brownie.
- Place the pan on a wire rack and cool completely. The ganache will sink in as it cools and more ganache can be added, to fill in any depressions, as long as the brownie is still warm enough to melt it. (If necessary, you can set the brownies under a lamp to heat the ganache puddles and make them smooth.) If making the optional ganache plugs, allow it to sit at room temperature until the puddles are firm to the touch. Then invert the mold of if using silicone, push each out with your finger pressed against the bottom of the mold. (If not making the ganache the brownies can be removed after 10 minutes of cooling.)
- Store wrapped airtight in plastic wrap and stored in an airtight container: 1 week at room temperature, 1 month refrigerated, or several months frozen. Try eating them frozen or chilled if you like a chewy brownie, room temperature for a softer creamier texture.

"There are a large number of students who have difficulty learning material using traditional teaching methods. Learning disabilities vary from mild forms such as attention deficit disorder to more severe disabilities like autism and mental retardation. Incorporating art into the curriculum of students with learning disabilities can be a useful tool. Students with disabilities are not students who are incapable of learning but instead are students who may need material presented to them using alternative methods. Methods that incorporate art can be very successful for these children.Many students with disabilities are separated from regular students for either part of all of the school day. These students spend a great deal of time focusing on remedial skills and learning new skills to help them catch up with the rest of the class. For students with learning disabilities the knowledge that they are not able to function at the same level as other students can be very discouraging. Introducing these students to art classes can offer them the opportunity to do something creative where success is not measured by the same standards as in regular academics. The feeling of succeeding at something can provide these students with self-worth and confidence that can carry over into other areas of study. Allowing children to be involved with art related activities also encourages creativity, problem solving skills, motor skills and other skills that are useful in all areas of academics like math, science and language.Art lessons can be combined with traditional lessons and used as a teaching tool for these students. Children that have difficulty with verbal expression will often have more success by expressing themselves through art. Practicing expression through art may translate to better overall communication skills. Teaching math and science lessons that are hands on art based lessons also tend to hold a student’s interest more than traditional lecture lessons. Sometimes just holding a student’s attention is half the battle especially for students with attention deficit disorder. Activities that encourage drawing and painting can help students learn about shapes, contrast and spatial relationships. Teachers can implement lessons that use these art activities to teach basic math skills like geometry and various other math techniques. Another interesting way to teach history involves having students create plays that focus on historical events. This method can help students internalize the material as oppose to just memorizing facts from a textbook.Teachers are often allowed to use alternative methods to assess a students skill set in a certain area when teaching a student with disabilities. Allowing students to create art projects that reflect their understanding of a concept can be a useful alternative to a traditional test. Allowing students to express creativity and learn about concepts using alternative methods is essential to development for those students who struggle in traditional settings. There are a multitude of resources available for educators who want to implement these techniques in the classroom. These methods can be useful for both students who are learning disabled and regular students. Implementation of these methods may help enable students with disabilities spend more time in a general education setting which is beneficial to their overall education. The benefits of education through art are numerous and should be implemented in the classroom whenever possible.",<urn:uuid:c6f98a2b-6e71-4363-a676-f54a483bb1d3>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://omexymcz.info/tag/arts-education,2024-02-20T23:35:48Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9598807096481323,593,3.927386999130249,4

Solage: Le basile
Le basile, like Pluseurs gens voy, counts as Ars Nova rather than Ars Subtilior, and there aren’t the rhythmic games hallowed in Subtilior. The rhythms are still wackier than Pluseurs gens: there is enough syncopation across barlines to justify the Mensurstich notation, and there is confusion about whether voices are off by half a bar or not, which the score indicates with alternative barline arrows.
This rendering also doesn’t sound quite as smooth, because of clashes in accidentals: the score needs more ficta accidentals than the source transcription shows, but I didn’t want to take over with my own editing. And some of the jarring intervals look to be in the source, unrelated to accidentals.
I can’t say Le basile has grabbed me in the way the Subtilior pieces have, or even Pluseurs gens: it’s not as tight as the latter, and not as funky as the former. But the more musically cluey may think differently.
This piece has broken LilyPond, btw, even more than the previous ones: the combination of Mensurstich, changing metres, and syncopation across bars has proven too much for the software, although I haven’t been able to replicate the error in a score snippet. So you’ll see a couple of barlines within the staff that shouldn’t be there—bar 2, for starters.
This is the last of the transcriptions in my friend Christina’s Honours thesis. The other pieces definitely by Solage don’t present the same rhythmic challenges; so she did not feel it necessary to retranscribe them from the four-square existing score published by Apel. That means I don’t get to put Fumeux fume par fumée up; but Daniel Buxeda Rodriguez already has. I think the license allows me to put it up on YouTube as I have the others; I’m checking.
So, if you’ll pardon a few wrong notes, and a synthesised French Horn, here is Solage’s song on the basilisk:

"AdSense Case Study
A multi-stage approach to niche site creation
This site you're visiting is a demonstration of one way to build a content-rich niche site that makes money using Google's AdSense system. The site is developed in stages so that you can see how exactly the site was developed.
- Stage 1: Content focuses on basic content development. In this stage all we do is select our topic and write content. No images, no fancy layout. Just simple HTML for each page: a title, a heading, a subheading, some text, and links to other pages on the site. The most complicated part of the page is the AdSense code that you'll find at the top (to display a horizontal link unit) and at the bottom (to display a horizontal ad unit) of each page. Normally, ads aren't placed on the page until after Stage 2, but part of the point of this case study is to see how and if the ads change as the pages are changed.
- Stage 2: Optimization focuses on AdSense optimization, which is really just a special case of search engine optimization (SEO). In this stage we look closely at our content and work to complete and target it. Are we mentioning the right keywords? Are there missing subtopics that we should be addressing? Do we have ""about"" and ""sitemap"" pages? Do we have the right keyword density? Are the keywords mentioned in the title and at least one of the headings? Do all the links work? Is there a natural flow between pages? Have we minimized the use of external links? Have we provided the right meta tags? Do we use headings, bolded text, italicized text, and lists to our best advantage?
- Stage 3: Images adds images to the site. Images are an easy way to make the site prettier. This includes building a banner to use in our header and adding images throughout the pages. Again, standard SEO techniques -- using ALT attributes and captions to identify the images, positioning the images near relevant text in the HTML -- play an important part.
- Stage 4: CSS beautifies the pages using cascading style sheets (CSS).
Coming next: More work on Stage 4.

"A Dog Escapes
The scary event that led to the Invisible Fence
On a dark and stormy night seriously! we let our dogs out in the backyard before going to bed. After a short while, Barney, a beagle-border collie cross, was back at the door. Waiting to be let in, he'd obviously had enough of the light rain. It had rained on and off for several days, and we were all quite sick of it. Carmy, a young golden retriever, was still out. I called her, but there was no answer. This wasn't unusual behavior, she was probably tracking a squirrel at the bottom of the yard, so I let her stay outside a while longer while we watched some television. The rain never bothers her.
A few minutes later, Barney barked at something he saw moving outside at the front of the house. We shushed him because our infant daughter was sleeping and went back to watching TV.
After ten more minutes, it was time to get Carmy in to the house. I called and called her name, to no avail. Finally, I resigned myself to putting on a jacket and boots and heading outside to fetch her. Something was obviously keeping her busy.
Once outside, however, I could find no trace of her. Worried now, I went back inside to grab a flashlight and proceeded to walk the entire length of our long wooden fence.
And there it was: a new hole. Carmy had taken advantage of the wet weather and the softened ground to dig herself a larger hole. Squatting, I took a close look at the hole and saw a big tuft of her fur hanging off the bottom of one of the boards. How she'd managed to squeeze her body through that hole I don't know, but obviously she had. And now she was gone!

"Why we needed an Invisible Fence
Running back to the house, I tell my wife what happened, and panic ensues. Both of us imagine Carmy being hit by a car as she crosses the busy street right next to our house. We can't both go searching for her because our daughter is sleeping upstairs in her crib, so my wife decides to drive around in her car and search for her while I stay at the house and call Carmy's name on the off chance she's still in the area.
Luckily, Carmy didn't go far. Instead of following and crossing the busy road, she had walked across our lawn to go explore our neighborhood. That's why Barney barked earlier he saw her run by the front door! My wife was just around the corner in her car, about to leave the neighborhood, when I saw a shape trotting towards us from a nearby crescent. It was Carmy, finally responding to our calls. She was safe!
We decided then and there to get ourselves an Invisible Fence.

"When you need Invisible Fence
The initial warning signs weren't enough to convince us that we needed to install Invisible Fence, but they seem so obvious in retrospect.
We noticed a small hole under the fence one day while walking on the adjacent sidewalk. The hole was small enough for a squirrel or rabbit but not large enough for a dog. Because of its size, we thought maybe an animal had dug it to get in and out of the yard. I went out back and filled it in with some dirt and looked for more holes. There were none, luckily.
A week or so later, however, the hole had reappeared. In fact, there was a second hole a bit further down the fence, and this one was a bit larger. I filled them both in and then used some stones and bits of concrete debris to prevent further digging at those spots.
You can see where this is going. New holes appeared and were promptly filled and blocked. We still hadn't clued in to the fact that we needed an Invisible Fence. Sometimes the stones and debris I placed were moved aside so that the animal (which I was fairly sure was one or both of our dogs by this point, but I had no real proof) could continue digging in one of the previous spots. Maybe they thought it was a game, but I just found it annoying.
Then came the escape.

"The Sales Call
Meeting the Invisible Fence dealer
We called our local Invisible Fence dealer the very next day, and he quickly arranged a meeting at our house to meet the dogs and assess the situation. (This particular dealer also sold inground sprinkler systems, but on this visit he was wearing his Invisible Fence hat.)
When Don arrived, he sat down with us and explained how hidden fence systems generally worked and what the specific advantages of the Invisible Fence brand pet containment system were. The system has three parts to it:
- a computerized control module,
- a buried wire (the hidden fence), and
- a special dog collar.
The system was fairly expensive in our case because we needed two dog collars, but we went ahead and ordered the system. We needed to keep our dogs safe, after all. We also opted for a second, standalone control module to keep the dogs out of our living room (more on that later).
The Invisible Fence computerized control module
The Invisible Fence dog collar
The hidden fence wire, exposed on a conventional fence
Installation of the wire was included in the price, but our situation was a bit different than most of Don's customers. Normally, people have the wire buried along their property line, hence the ""hidden fence"" moniker. We already had a wooden fence, however, and so the dealer would simply run most of the the wire along the bottom of the fence instead of burying it in the ground.
After the installation, Don would show us how to train the dogs. A training video and some training flags were also included in the overall price.
The only ongoing costs would be the replacement batteries for the dog collars, which the dealer recommended we change every three to four months.",<urn:uuid:0d283fb6-7d90-4dd2-9af6-7ac866b64600>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://pet-fence.ericgiguere.com/stage4/sales-call.html;jsessionid=2F62D3601E8D5A13984B5080672D2D4A,2024-02-20T22:24:09Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9702050089836121,363,1.1075735092163086,1

"Cyprus University of Technology (CUT) is an established public university, which was founded by law on December 2003. It is one of three state universities in Cyprus. Cyprus University of Technology is a dynamic university with six leading schools/faculties and 10 academic departments, able to offer education and high level research, in primary branches of science and applied technology, at Undergraduate and Postgraduate levels. Currently CUT runs a number of master courses including a Masters in Environmental Health (in English) in collaboration with Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH).
Cyprus University of Technology (CUT) has as its strategic target the design and development of research activities both within the University and in cooperation with other research Institutes in Cyprus and abroad. The research emphasis of CUT is reflected in the substantial funding provided to academics for the establishment of research centres and laboratories. CUT aims at transferring knowledge (education) and producing new knowledge through basic and applied research in all the academic fields of the University’s six Faculties. Research is carried out in each different Department or between two or more Departments, under the responsibility of one or more members of the academic staff. University research activities are realized through funding secured from two major sources: from the University’s state funded budget and from different organizations, entities or private sources at national, European and international level who award, with or without a competition, specific research projects to research groups and/or individual members of the Academic staff. Strengthening of the research management support and infrastructure, with the aim of securing externally funded projects, is another major objective of the University. Moreover, the University has adopted principles in relation to research which conform with the European Union’s declarations relating to the creation of the European Research Area (ERA). CUT research and academic staff is involved in various Research Activities and National and European Research Programmes. CUT has managed to dispose of a significant number, of National Research Projects funded by the Cyprus Research Promotion Foundation and of European Research Projects funded under the European Research Framework Programmes (FP6, FP7, HORIZON2020), the LIFE and IEE Programmes, the European Territorial Cooperation Programmes and other. In details, CUT research and academic staff is involved in 150 Projects with a total funding/contribution over than 18 million Euro.

"The Gallery Zlotowski has a very particular relationship with Edwart Vignot’s work. At the Salon du Dessin in Paris Edwart greatly admired a purist still life by Amédee Ozenfant that the gallery was showing. Shortly afterwards, he found and photographed his own version of the same still life at the table corner of a Parisian restaurant. This was to be the start of our collaboration.
Edwart Vignot’s photos are nourrished with references to the history of art, which becomes his raw material. Scattered waste is reminiscent of Kurt Schwitters’s compositions, wrinkled papers turn into Jacques-Louis David’s drapery. Edwart Vignot joyfully jumps from deep knowledge of art to snapshots and sees the grand masters’ compositions on the traces of the sidewalk. Thanks to an impressive iconography and an exceptional sensitivity to his environment, the photographer detects poetry in the most trivial features of everyday life. He reveals a universe accessible to everyone but that is transformed through his vision. He takes random photos when out walking or on visits to museums. A piece of cardboard stuck to the floor becomes an element of the “broken ear” from Tintin’s famous album. A garbage bag transforms itself into a cat having a wash; papers caught in a cobweb become an abstract composition…
Playful and smart, Edwart Vignot’s work re-enchants reality by enabling artworks to exist outside their materiality. He also helps to understand the obviousness and simplicity of masterpieces. But because art is also a way of embracing the world that surrounds us, his work can be considered as an education of the eye. Each of us can look at a street, a wall or at the walls of an art gallery in Edwart Vignot’s way. And each one of us may have the good fortune to see how beautiful things suddenly become.
Fang Yen Wen
Shinra – The Wide World
Fang Yen-Wen, a young photographer born in 1994, is an accurate and sensitive observer of Taiwan and its transformations. From his already rich and diverse work, Galerie Zlotowski has chosen to show photographs both elegantly composed and full of poetry. The care for composition and color contributes to a melancholic atmosphere in which disillusioned characters are the silent witnesses of oppression, be it economical, urban, or political.
The series dedicated to elderly shopkeepers of Taipei highlights, in heavily detailed compositions, resigned and dreamy figures who seem to have been swallowed by their own shop, waiting for the (definitive?) closing.
Other pictures taken in Japan unveil a harrowing side of Asian metropolises, elegant but dehumanizing. Silhouettes are frozen by the eye of the photographer. Humans become simple pawns in a city turned into a giant chessboard. The strict geometry of the downtown architecture embodies a frame for their loneliness.
More political, photographs of the Taiwanese sunflower revolution (March 2014) shows demonstrators in a striking way, united and isolated at the same time.
Whatever his subject matter, his characters are more or less at the center of a chaotic scene with a highly-elaborated composition. Bathed in light, thanks to the photographer’s viewpoint, they recover presence and dignity. This constant care about light, often artificial, and to the process of building an image, helps to temper the anxiety contained in the photos which revolve around the ideas of fragility and loss. Maybe as an echo of the threats that weigh upon the territory of Taiwan.",<urn:uuid:bb7c717f-55b3-4a59-858d-2e5798f072a1>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://photosaintgermain.com/en/editions/2015/parcours/galerie-zlotowski,2024-02-20T22:20:24Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9572197198867798,742,1.5722315311431885,2
"The Lodge Pole Pine Christmas tree is a native to the Rocky Mountains in the western in the western United States.
However, the Lodgepole found greater popularity in the UK as a Christmas tree.
Lodgepole pine is a species that is native to western North America, as far north as the Yukon and south to Baja California. It ranges east to the Black Hills of South Dakota and west all the way to the Pacific Ocean .It was introduced to the UK in 1855 and growers like its resistance to pests and its ability to grow well on poor wet soils.
Mature trees grow to 30 metres.
Typically available from 4ft to 12ft - this a low needle drop tree.
It forms clean, gradually tapering shafts which were used by Native Americans to make their lodges, hence the name ""lodgepole pine."" The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and of California also used different parts of the plant internally and externally as a traditional medicine for various ailments.The gum of shore pine was used medicinally as well as for chewing. Native Americans consumed the inner bark of lodgepole pine to prevent starvation for themselves and their horses

"After the famous earthquake of 1755 that destroyed much of the city and could be felt all across the Mediterranean and much of continental Europe, the people of Lisbon had to rebuild the city. Portugal’s chief minister Sebastia Jose de Carvalho e Mello (1699 – 1782) was particularly influential in modernizing the old city. He conducted a survey among local priests to find out as much as possible about how people experienced the disaster. He also changed the layout of the city significantly.

"This is the traditional festive head gear worn by Bajau women. The Bajau, a formerly nomadic people now mostly home to Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, live by and from the sea and have recently gained recognition for a genetic trait that allows them to dive deeper and for longer time stretches than any other ethnic group. They are often referred to as Sea People and this traditional head gear seems to symbolize this. I could not find any interpretation of the shape, but they appear to me like ships or tail fins of sea mammals or mermaids – or all three.
The Orang Laut, who mainly settle in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, the Moken in Thailand, and the Sama-Bajau who mainly live in East-Malaysia and the Philippines are ethnic groups that have a seaborne or amphibian lifestyle and culture.
The Malayan name Orang Laut literally translates as Sea People. The Moken are also called chao nam in Thai, meaning “people of the water”. Both the Moken and the Bajau are nomadic societies, moving between islands along various coasts, some families even spending long periods of the year living on their boats. The largest group, the Bajau, are said to exist for over 1.000 years. I did not know that there were nomadic sea faring societies like that at all. Apparently several Bajau myths exist that explain how and why they first adopted their nomadic lifestyle.
This picture of a “typical” settlement of Bajau in the Philippines I find particularly striking for the isolation of the individual buildings and the lack of any visible land close by:
Traditionally these societies lived from fishing but there are anthropological indications that at least the Bajau were once an agricultural society. Their traditional lifestyles center around fishing and harvesting sea plants and the often nomadic lifestyle make them very vulnerable to environmental damage, economic and political exploitation and oppression. Many of them have meanwhile settled on land and further off the sea coast for better employment opportunities.
Two other links are noteworthy here:
In the Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004, the Moken people who lived around the Surin Islands of Thailand were able to predict the events quite accurately which allowed them to warn and protect the island population. However in other places, Moken suffered severe devastation to housing and fishing boats by the tsunami. (see related scientific report on indigenous knowledge and disaster here.)
These ethnic groups are probably the inspiration to many myths about sea people in the region. As biological studies have recently revealed, the Moken and Bajau show genetic traits that allow better under water vision and a significantly greater ability to dive and hold their breath. These sea people are probably the closest humanity gets to mythical figures like “aqua men”, “frog men” or “mermaids”. (See for example the Filippino movie “Beyond Atlantis” from 1973.)",<urn:uuid:0341646f-76c5-4d2c-8cf3-9b3852749c47>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://polisea.postproduktion.org/tag/malaysia,2024-02-20T23:34:51Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9658790230751038,615,3.0966436862945557,3
"Alex Neill, Which? Managing Director of Home Services, said:
“This eye-watering increase to the price cap will be a shock to the system for people who thought that it would protect them from rising bills.
“Energy customers can take the power back into their hands by switching and securing a better deal before the new cap comes into effect in April. While there are fewer cheap deals on the market than a year ago, by switching today you could choose better customer service and potentially save more than £150 a year.”
Notes to editors
- Customers looking for cheaper energy deals can compare deals with Which? Switch, a transparent and impartial way to compare energy tariffs and find the best gas and electricity supplier.
- Which? calculates that a medium user (using 3,100kWh gas and 12,000kWh electricity per year) on a dual-fuel default or tariff standard tariff at the level of the current price cap could save up to £163 by switching to the cheapest deal on the market. Based on tariffs available in all regions in England, Scotland and Wales, paying by monthly direct debit, with paperless bills. Data is from Energylinx and correct on 04 February 2019.
- Which? conducted research with consumers to ask about their awareness and likely bill impact of the energy price cap, via an online survey conducted by Research Now SSI of 4,054 people across the United Kingdom. Data were weighted to be representative of the UK population, with questions on the energy price cap only being asked to respondents in Great Britain. This found that more people were unaware of the energy price cap (48%) than were aware of it (45%) and, for those consumers who had never switched supplier – hence more likely to be disengaged and supposed to benefit most from the introduction of the price cap – the proportion who thought their bills would decrease was only 13%. Further detail on the research is available at: https://consumerinsight.which.co.uk/articles/energy-price-cap-attitudes.
- In December Which? found that the number of energy deals costing less than £1,000 a year for medium users had dropped from 77 in January to eight. As of Monday 4th February there were six deals costing £1,000 a year or less: https://press.which.co.uk/whichpressreleases/cheap-energy-deals-vanishing-from-market-as-price-cap-comes-in-which-reveals/",<urn:uuid:60520f1a-53cb-4b63-8ab5-e2025925ffcb>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://press.which.co.uk/which-responds-to-energy-price-cap-increase/,2024-02-20T22:00:59Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9671840071678162,516,1.9595229625701904,2

"I know I'm not a cat, but I've taken to drinking milk from a bowl (no, not lapping it up, but drinking as if it were a cup). You're probably wondering why:
• Well, one of those reasons is that I dip my peanut butter sandwiches in milk, and it's a whole lot easier to do that in a bowl than in a cup (the brim is wider; so, you don't have to worry about the size of your bread, getting peanut butter streaks on the side, and such).
• Another reason is that our bowls that I use fit a lot more milk than our glasses. I've long wanted some pretty large glass cups, but we just don't have them. The bowls are just a little bit larger than I would strictly want. So, it works out.
• Bowls are easier to wash than cups, IMO.
Anyway, here's how I make my peanut butter sandwiches:
I typically make two sandwiches at a time. I use bread (typically some wheat or multi-grain bread with large slices). I spread Skippy Natural peanut butter on two slices. Then I spread something like jam/preserves/jelly or honey on the same slice (or blue agave sweetener on the slices without peanut butter). Then I stick them together. Then I cut them in half. Then I eat them, typically dipping them in milk before eat bite.
I know some people mix butter with their peanut butter. I've tried that, and it's good, but I don't feel the need to do it, personally. I'd rather use or wash one less knife in making my sandwiches (two is enough: one for the peanut butter, and one for the jam—I definitely don't like peanut butter residue in the jam, or jam residue in the peanut butter). For those who use bottles, more power to you. For those who use bottles of peanut butter and jam mixed together, that's cool, even if I don't know feel comfortable with the idea.
How do you make and eat your peanut butter sandwiches? Does my way sound odd to you?
I know some people just make their sandwiches and have a glass of milk
without dipping their sandwiches in their milk. I don't really understand that. It tastes and feels so much better dipped, IMO. I dip my cookies in milk, too, by the way (some people I've observed don't actually do that, even if they like to drink a glass of milk while they're eating cookies; I don't really understand that, either, unless the cookies aren't dry/crunchy; then, I totally understand, even if I think they're still good with milk). So, yeah, I use milk like a permeable sauce, I guess. This reminds me of why I like ketchup:
• It makes the food less dry; so, I'm less likely to get the hiccups when I eat it.
• Eating tomatoes (I believe even from ketchup) is said to temporarily lower blood mercury levels. Nevermind the rumors that are hopefully untrue about mercury and high fructose corn syrup (which is in ketchup).
• Lycopene from cooked tomatoes
• It's red. I like red stuff.
• The acidity from the vinegar and tomatoes in the ketchup goes quite well with meat. I like acids and meats together for some reason.
• It improves the texture of some foods.

There are a few benefits to E-filing your tax returns, including:
- Faster because it is electronically transmitted directly to the taxing authorities’ computer system
- Safer because the filing cannot get lost in the mail
- More secure
- More convenient, you don’t have to wait on line at the post office if you are too close to the filing deadline

"How to Plan For Your Child With Special Need's Future
Parents of children with special needs must plan for the years ahead in important ways. Here’s where to begin.

Try to set up a budget for your dependent’s needs, so you can get a rough estimate of what those expenses would be. “Once you have an idea of how much money will be needed for him or her, then you can evaluate how you are going to fund that need in a trust,” Collier says.
Guardians and Trustees
Consider carefully who will be the people to provide support for your child, Gildin urges. “Some adults with disabilities will require a guardian who has the legal ability to make decisions for him or her, while someone [else] may need to act as a trustee to oversee the special needs trust,” Gildin says. She encourages parents to involve their child in this planning process as much as is practical.
Trustees have complete control of the finances and assets in the SNT. Parents do not need to give this control over to one relative or close friend; they can choose co-trustees instead. Peretz recommends three: “This will avoid the autonomy associated with having one trustee appointed, and the potential for deadlocks between an even number of trustees,” she explains.
Guardians, rather than controlling the financial side of your child’s life, will make decisions such as living arrangements, doctor selection, and transportation arrangements. Although it can be helpful if a trustee is also the guardian, Peretz notes, it’s quite possible that a person perfectly suited to making financial decisions isn’t necessarily the ideal caretaker. If you do decide to split up those responsibilities, make sure the respective parties’ temperaments and perspectives on such practical matters jibe. You may love and trust both your sister and your childhood best friend, but if the two don’t usually see eye-to-eye, it may not be wise to pair them in these important roles.
Your Will, Power of Attorney, and Health Care Proxy
Your will is where you name your child’s trustee(s) and guardian. Once you decide on them, it is crucial to consult your attorney to make sure your will is executed properly, and any and all beneficiary designations are spelled out as they should be, Collier says.
A durable power of attorney appoints the individuals who can act on your behalf while you are still alive. “This is a very powerful tool to ensure that your child is taken care of should you become incapacitated,” says Nadine Gordon Lee, a certified financial planner with the Colony Group Family Offices in Manhattan and Armonk. For much the same reason, it’s smart to have health care proxies and related directives in place, she adds.
Properly Executed Life Insurance
Parents should make sure life insurance will be payable to the special needs trust, not directly paid out to the child, which could negate any government benefits due him or her. Lou Cannataro, partner at Cannataro Park Avenue Financial in Manhattan, advises purchasing separate life insurance policies for the spouse and any other children in the family. He points to “second to die” coverage as the most efficient life insurance for this type of situation. “Second to die is one policy that covers both parents. There is no payout until the second parent dies, for typically this is when the child is truly on their own.”
Planning for a child’s future is important for all parents, but for parents of a child with special needs, the conversation is taken to another level. “We all nurture and plan for our child with the hope that our responsibility wanes once they begin to build their own lives,” Cannataro observes. “For parents with a [child with special needs], this role never ends.” So, while thinking ahead to a time when you won’t be able to care for your child as you do now is unsettling, even overwhelming, the best thing you can do for your child, and your own peace of mind, is to get started now.",<urn:uuid:283d621c-9a61-4fd9-af96-0ac76400148e>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://rockland.nymetroparents.com/article/planning-for-children-with-special-needs-futures,2024-02-20T22:58:00Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9562351703643799,893,1.8503501415252686,2

"The Deadly Stress of Being a Black Woman in America
Now that the federal authorities have arrested Cesar Sayoc in connection with the explosive devices sent to many of those whom Donald Trump rages against as enemies — prominent Democrats, other critics of the President and CNN — some will argue that he is merely a disturbed individual, a lone actor, with no connection to the atmosphere created by the Trump presidency. This is most likely not true.
Yes, Cesar Sayoc appears to be a troubled man. The terror spree he conducted could only be carried out by a person with certain psychological deficits. However, he is not a unique character operating in a vacuum. Cesar Sayocs can be found almost anywhere in America.
[bs-quote quote=”You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.” style=”style-23″ align=”left” author_name=”Darren Hardy” author_job=”American Author” author_avatar=””]
It is this reality that burdens public figures, especially presidents, with the responsibility to use care and caution as they lead the nation. The exception is Donald Trump, whose superheated rhetoric could make himself a factor in the run-up to terror.
Investigators will eventually reveal many factors that could have played a role in the process that led to the mailing of the explosive devices.
Likely Trump’s rhetoric will be just one of many elements. However, denying that it played a role is not an option. Neither can we expect Trump to change.Trump campaigned using taunts and suggestions that all the Cesar Sayocs could have heard as calls to violent action.
When a protester interrupted a rally, Trump announced that he would “like to punch him in the face” and waxed sentimental about the days when protesters would be “carried out on stretchers.”He referenced a “Second Amendment” response to Hillary Clinton’s possible election and offered to pay the legal bills for those who assault his protesters.
The President’s encouragement of violence, combined with rhetoric about the press being “enemies of the people” and political opponents being un-American, are green lights for those who are vulnerable to suggestion. Worse, when you think about the President’s impact on fevered minds, is his penchant for conspiracy theories. With no evidence, he recently suggested terrorists were among immigrants now marching toward the United States.people to believe that almost anything can be true.
Taken together, Trump’s paranoid rants encourage people to believe that almost anything can be true.
Trump allies and fans rejected the notion that he was playing a dangerous game and instead praised his willingness to forgo political correctness and speak plainly. However, this wasn’t plain speech, it was incitement, and the notion that milder rhetoric is somehow less sincere is absurd.Politicians who honor the boundaries of decency and public safety are not mealy-mouthed pleasers. They are normal adults who respect public safety.
As president, Trump never pivoted from his destructive campaign mode to become a leader of all the American people. Just weeks ago, he praised fellow Republican Greg Gianforte for assaulting a reporter who had asked him a question. “Any guy that can do a body slam, he’s my kind of … He was my guy,” said Trump.",<urn:uuid:bb2cd2a1-0cc9-49fc-a88e-40ac98c71453>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://sadhinbanglanews.com/2021/08/23/bs-the-deadly-stress-of-being-a-black-woman-in-america/,2024-02-20T22:27:08Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9715319871902466,728,1.6356613636016846,2

"Also known as soundtrack for returning to the gym when you are feeling all that and out of breath.
For the first time in quite some time it was warm. No threat of snow, no biting temps, leave your coat in the car type of weather. Surprisingly I am not experiencing the familiar panic of not being ready for the warmer weather which means showing more skin although really, I am totes not ready. I find myself thinking about the fact that there is a little more of me to love ’cause I recently discovered Talenti Gelato is THAT stuff and I am here for it (…Talenti…arrrgr *Homer Simpson drool). I am not worrying myself over having a little more of Rachee to love. I am embracing the curves and working it.
But Spring is coming.
Spring means warm weather means more Rachee to show.
Suddenly I’m not feeling so confident.
I headed back to the gym today with a goal of just getting there. I’ve had a few false starts but today I was determined to actually get there. No excuses, no real plan, taking that first step.
We went to see the AMAZING Cirque Elioze and instead of my normal feelings of inadequacy watching the performers I felt a sense of awe. I want to be able to control my body and own such strngth. I want to be able to climb and swing from a pole effortlessly.
So songs to power through a workout and prepare for heavy lifting.
Abba – Knowing Me, Knowing You
Yes, I know this is a song about a break up but it came on in the gym today and it was perfect. Instead of me worrying over why I am not three inches taller and [redacted] pounds lighter I thought about what I can do and powered through my workout.
Madonna – Rainbow High – Evita Soundtrack
I feel some type of way about Madonna as Evita but for the sake of this post I’ll let it slide. Madonna, whether you care for the changes or not, has totally gotten better physically as she ages. Madge truly has no cares to give and will let you know it.
Honestly, her arms, her legs, strength!
Big Spender – Sweet Charity Soundtrack
This one may be a stretch but work with me.
What are you willing to give to get what you want? I love sleeping in but I also love knowing that no one will be able to hear me breathing while I am at rest. And it’s not really a sacrifice. I like a stronger, healthier me and know that giving retooling my routine will allow for what I want.
I Can Do That – Chorus Line
I can do that.
I don’t say that in a envious way that frankly I would have uttered in the past. Nope; I am so inspired to be stronger and I am inspired to be able to honor my body by making it different than what it is now.
Disney’s Frozen “Let It Go” Sequence Performed by Idina Menzel
I’m tired of this song too but it’s so appropos for lots of places in my life.
Let go of the worry, the comparing, the feeling bad about just existing.
Now, it’s your turn! Tell me…what are your songs for letting it go, feeling better and (forgive me) doing you?

"Please to note: Today’s blog may contain the notion that somewhere, someone, perhaps even your blogger, has sex.
Now then, there are five things I am not supposed to speak about in mixed company but I guess, as I read throughout my blog, I have already done so:
Notice that sex is left blank. I tried to keep my blog family (as in my family reads it and family includes MOM!!!) friendly and I feel that some things are best left to lurk in my head strictly for my own examination. I am not a prude but there are just some things that I am not comfortable thinking or speaking about beyond whispered to a close friend. However, the more I think of MOVING ON (cue music: omnious or Peer Gynt Suite) the more my thoughts spin. The PC thing would be for me to write that I am looking for a good man to have a wonderful relationship that would someday lead to another trip down the aisle. And that would be a lie at this moment in time. Personally (and quite selflessly I dare to add!) I think it would be cruel to jump into another relationship right now especially with my head all a whirl and me hating the idea of marriage. My head is a jumble of what ifs and what the effs and I am not just not capable of keeping a lid in all of the crazy. I am not opposed and could find myself saying yes to dinners that do not come numbered with pictures, nights in, snuggled on a couch with a bowl of ice cream and a scary movie (all the better to snuggle closer) and some adult swim conversations that don’t ultimately end with me fussing about The Bee and what she didn’t so.
When I spoke with a friend and discussed my new idea about dating, he compared me to a character from a Madea movie: he told me that I always whine about needing a good man yet when one comes along I push him away. Perhaps there is a tinge of truth in his words but I have to say the idea of dating, allowing myself to become intimate (not just physically but mentally and emotionally as well) and to open myself for anything that I cannot in some all ways way control scares the ever loving crap out of me. Dating in this new millennium is a bitch! I have a kid to consider, left over feelings from my marriage (shh! don’t let anyone know that at times I do get emotional and girly!) and quite honestly I have gotten into a rut, albeit a sad, lonely, pathetic, isolated, Oh God please kill me, one, that is working just fine…sorta. In the merry land of sometime soon, I keep thinking that things will be OK and that I will get it together but as we all know, time waits for NO man or woman.
My brief history of men could be material for a sequel to He’s just not that into you or a Tyler Perry movie but that won’t deter me. I would be lying if I said that I have spent five years alone. But my last associations were a little less than ideal. (Let me preface this by saying that I am a sucker for a pretty face -guilty as charged!, have a horrible sense of judgement at times and, in case you have never read this blog, have issues.)
So, the male company have included:
-The old boyfriend that I reconnected with after bumping into him while out with our respective kids. Nice guy but damn! Both parties can’t have that much baggage! We obviously broke up for a reason in the past and have thus decided it’s best to JUST be friends.
-Someone I met at work. An older guy who wanted me to meet his parents (no big) and become friends with his daughter (um, ‘kay). Dude and I would chat, chat, chat for hours about school, plans we had for our respective futures in the field of education, talk books and make plans. However he would always ‘forget’ that we were supposed to go out yet would call and yell at me when we hadn’t made plans.
-Another older guy who thus inspired my “let’s not date patrons” rule. He thought that I should not let The Bee go back and forth to her dad’s because it was a lot of money for gas (like he was paying for it!) and she would get confused, was known to just show up at work to say hi and he always wanted to do some type of family get together with The Bee and I although his relationship with his kids was totally effed up. He was also hot to get married and I was not quite on the same track.
-There was the young guy who at 23 (I’m a cougar!) thought I should be delighted that he called at 1:30 AM every night. Cause he used to call at 2:15.
Dating is a bitch!
Despite these, erm, experiences I have decided that I am going to throw myself out there. I’ve cleared a space on my floor that is dedicated to the art of crunches and yoga type stuff to center my mind, I’ve hit the gym cause I pay for my membership and it’s too cold to be messing about on the tracks and I’ve called the cousin for torture, aka eyebrow waxing. All because I’m single and I’ve got to look good naked.

"Tablet computer ownership in the United States increased from 3 percent of adults in 2010 to 34 percent by 2013. What's more, 70 percent of children in households with a tablet computer use these wireless devices. That aside, tablet computers are expensive toys, and when things go wrong, parents can face costly repair and data recovery bills. If your child regularly uses your tablet computer, learn how you can protect the device with these useful tips and tricks.
Invest in a robust case
Small fingers can easily lose their grip on a sleek tablet computer, but even a relatively minor bump can crack the glass screen. Analysis shows that 20 percent of tablet owners damage their screen within two years of ownership. Screen protectors can extend the life of your tablet by offering a durable layer that can resist scratches, cracks and bumps. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully when applying these film layers, or you'll just end up trapping dust and dirt underneath the protector.
A robust tablet case is also essential if your children plan to use the device. Some cases cater more for adults, with features that focus more on usability than protection, but parents should invest in a chunky, durable case that can withstand drops and bumps. The good news is that many of these case designs will appeal enormously to kids, with futuristic features and strong, tactile design elements that convince children they're in a sci-fi movie.
Get battery smart
You can't change the battery in most tablet computers, so it's important to extend the life as far as possible. Kids don't normally think about these things, so parents must educate them. Crucially, device manufacturers don't recommend that you fully charge the battery, so always aim to keep the battery at around 50 percent capacity. Show kids how to turn the device off when they have finished, so you can then charge the computer in the right way.
It's also important to store the device in a cool, moisture-free place in the home, below 90 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not something kids will automatically think about. Appoint a storage place for the tablet in your home, and warn the kids that if they don't return it there when they have finished, they won't get to use the device again. They'll soon learn!
Regularly back up your data
Kids have a habit of doing 'strange' things with computers that ultimately result in data loss. If you don't want the children to delete important files from your tablet, make sure you regularly back up the device. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions to find out how to do this, and consider synchronizing your data with a cloud storage service. Even if you're only protecting precious family photos, it's good to have the reassurance that you won't suffer from a mischievous figure tapping the delete button.
Install parental controls
Manufacturers design tablet computers so that anyone can pretty much pick up the device and get surfing, but that design also makes it easy for kids to run amok. For example, in the UK, one girl managed to rack up a bill of more than $6,000 by playing 'free' applications on her father's iPad. The good news is that most devices now offer settings to help avoid this.
Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for more advice, but look for features that help you:
Set usage boundaries
It's also important to set boundaries with your kids. Make it clear that you're happy for them to use the device, but you expect them only to use the games and applications you approve. You should also put rules in place about when they can and can't use the device.
Experts are increasingly concerned that excessive computer use can harm your children. Researchers at Boston University School of Medicine concluded that tablet computers could stunt kids' emotional development because they make it harder for children to control their emotions. In fact, lawmakers in Taiwan recently introduced a law change that means parents have to control the time their kids spend on a computer.
Legislation is not necessarily the answer, but parents should still pay close attention to the time their kids' spend using tablet computers. For example, make a point of enjoying applications together, as this can help youngsters have fun and learn new things while spending quality time with their parents.
Tablet computers have changed the way people access the Internet, and statistics show that kids love these new devices. That aside, parents must take extra precautions to make sure their kids and their computers don't harm one another.
If you or your child has damaged your table and it needs repairs, you can contact a company, like Nation's First Office Repair, that specializes in tablet repairs.",<urn:uuid:bb766934-9828-4f77-b4b2-4dcdff01d635>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://sektion-platzverbot.com/2015/02/10/protecting-your-tablet-from-your-kids-5-important-tips-for-parents/,2024-02-20T23:32:18Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.962178111076355,940,2.4011471271514893,2
"Laptops are becoming more and more popular as time goes on. You may not know what you are missing out on if you do not yet have a laptop computer. Here is some laptop advice you can use to help you get the most from your machine.
Consider a touchscreen laptop. More and more software for PCs is being created with touchscreen technology in mind, meaning this option will become increasingly essential as time goes on. By purchasing the technology now, you can take advantage of the touchscreen features and not feel a necessity to re-buy another computer for several years.
Consider buying a full-sized 15 inch screen if you don't plan on carrying your new laptop around much. It will offer you the best viewing options, as well as being the most cost-effective you can get. Pound for pound, worth their viewing pleasure, even though they are a little heavier than their smaller counterparts.
Consider battery life when you go shopping for a laptop. If you have to travel a lot via car or in the air, this is especially important. Check to see how long the battery of your prospective computer is supposed to last. Be careful, though as many manufacturers indicate the battery usage time but it could be at its lowest setting. Try to find out the standard battery life when used in all power modes.
Consider how much security you need for your laptop computer. How much personal and business information is available on your device? Fingerprint scanners are used to prohibit access to the operating system. Only the person whose fingerprints scan as the owner will be allowed to use the system. No security measures are full proof, however.
You should xbode inspect it thoroughly before going through with the deal if you are purchasing a used laptop from a private seller. Inspect the outside first and make sure it is not damaged. Turn the computer on and make sure it connects to the Internet. You have no guarantees with a private sale, so make sure everything looks good first.
Make sure your laptop includes WiFi. While most laptops today do, some older models are still around that do not include this important feature. Without WiFi, you will not be able to connect to a wireless router, and this means you cannot use your laptop in a coffee shop, many hotels or even the airport.
If you are buying a laptop on a small budget, look for refurbished laptops. These are used laptops that have been cleaned up and tuned up. You can get a great deal on a perfectly functioning laptop. You still need to do some research to make sure the computer you pick fits your needs.
Do you need a CD drive? Many computers today do not come with CD drives. Be sure that any computer you are considering purchasing has a CD drive if you need or want one in a computer. If you aren't sure if you need one, you can always purchase an external CD drive.
When trying to choose a laptop, consider what you plan to use it for. For example, there are models meant for business use, and others that are best for gaming. Look for the type you will use and get additional features within your price range.
If at all possible, when you buy a new laptop, invest in tracking software for it. If it's lost or stolen whenever the thief logs onto the Internet, these handy programs can locate your laptop. This software has been very successful in helping owners, as well as authorities, track down stolen laptops.
Many manufacturers are pushing the public towards hybrid laptops. A hybrid laptop is one that can function as both a tablet and as a laptop. Currently, these products do not excel at either. You can purchase a tablet that is far superior to any hybrid and you can purchase a laptop that will give you a better experience than any hybrid as well.
While we all know that laptops can connect to wifi, we don't all have wifi in our home. You have to consider how you will connect your laptop to the network when you are in your house if you don't. Your choices are to buy a laptop with an Ethernet port or a wifi router.
Make sure the laptop has a wireless Internet connection. This really comes in handy when you are traveling with your laptop. Many public and private places offer free-wifi so you can access the Internet. You will need a laptop that has a wireless Internet connection in order to do so.
Check online to find out how much upgrades to the model you wish to buy are running other customers. You will find complaints online which can sway you from any brand which isn't receptive to upgrading your laptop or point you in the direction of a company which makes it easy if the price is high.
Find out what kinds of programs are already going to be on the laptop. You probably will need to use the spreadsheet and word processing software, sometimes. Additionally, check that these are the full versions and not merely demonstration ones. If these are not included on your laptop, it will cost you to have them added.
You need to ship it in the right kind of container if you have to ship a laptop somewhere for whatever reason. Many parcel mailing places have boxes and padding specifically for shipping laptops. Consider purchasing one of these, even if you chose the post for actual shipping.
To keep laptop thieves from getting into your company's network, if your laptop is stolen, hurry to another computer and change your password to that network. These keeps access to your corporate servers confidential -- and safer. It may also be the difference between you losing just your laptop, or your job as well.
Now you have some basic knowledge about choosing the right laptop for your particular needs. Make an effort to keep these tips in mind when you're hunting for the best one. You will soon realize what the rest of us know: laptops are great.",<urn:uuid:d62ed5bd-b47a-40a6-99c9-d6b0079baea8>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://sergioexrd648.trexgame.net/top-laptop-tips-straight-from-the-technology-experts,2024-02-20T22:32:44Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9621931910514832,1171,1.853320837020874,2
"My wife undoubtedly looks forward to throwing her parties, plus I look forward to hiding out in the basement lady cave while she hosts them.

"Bigg Boss 11: You’ll be shocked to know who’s the new captain of the house!
Controversial show, Bigg Boss recently witnessed Priyank’s re-entry in the house and with this, the house is sure to pique the interest of many avid fans as to what will unfold next!
And adding further excitement to the episode airing tonight, the housemates will elect Luv Tyagi as the captain of the house.
Luv, who entered the house as a padosi, was expected to create more hullabaloo in the house, however, he gradually fizzled out. The lad has been tagged as one of the most boring contestants and we feel he has managed to come so far once because of the immunity he has won. Luck has been favourable to him on many instances and a fine example would be of the time when the inmates picked on Lucinda for eviction and the phase when the eliminations were nullified due to Diwali celebrations.
Luv has been nominated for this week too and if he is saved, he will be immune from the eliminations for the next week as well.
With him not being able to deliver content, we wonder how long will his stay in the glass walled house be prolonged? Also, with him being given a chance of captaincy, it’ll be interesting to know how will his stance change!

"While MFI is excited that MA citizens will have the opportunity to repeal the Bathroom and Locker Room Law in 2018, next month, we have the chance to stop the legalization of recreational marijuana.
MFI is working with a broad, bipartisan coalition of leaders throughout the Commonwealth who understand the dangers of marijuana. Please vote NO on Question 4 this November to protect children and teens from the slippery slope that is recreational marijuana. Some facts you should know about Question 4:
- It is a ballot measure that’s all about commercialization, not legalization. It’s a business plan disguised as a law, designed to enable a billion-dollar-a-year commercial marijuana industry to set up shop all across Massachusetts. Whatever you feel about marijuana, Question 4 is the wrong direction and goes too far.
- It specifically authorizes the sale and promotion of high potency marijuana edibles.
- It will increase the danger from drugged driving while offering no solutions to this growing problem.
- It would mean communities and homeowners lose control.

This is really cool. Last week I visited a high school in the town of Penn Yan, NY, and the librarian had me give a presentation on my book Undefeated just for the football team. They seemed to be into it – but it’s not always easy to tell with teenagers. But then, this week, […]

"Knock-out Cup – Summary
A keen group of shooters met this morning at 10am for the traditional ‘Cup’. It was a nice surprise that even the Consul General of Switzerland, Markus Thür and his wife, registered for the competition. We saw some good shooting thru-out the competition. Markus got far but had some bad luck with one ‘off-shot’ so that our Club president Dierk made it to the semi-final. Paul Schweizer had a rough start with his new shooting glasses but once he sorted this out he improved in every round and won an interesting final by one point. Stefan – who shot with Paul’s riffle was in the end put to 2nd place. Congratulations to all the shooters and the winner Paul.
Dear Shooting Comrades!

The SRC Cape Town officially participates in various Swiss based shooting programs. The club records and submits these official program result for all members to Switzerland for them to be adjudicated and verified. There are numerous awards, certificates or medals that various programs offer as recognition to the members in relation to their scores. These medals and certificates are issued in Switzerland and brought over to South Africa where the club distributes to the members at the annual prize giving.
So what are these programs?
Here is a list of the most popular and participated in official Swiss Shooting programs:
Feldschiessen (Veld Shooting)
Schweizerische Sektions Mesiterschaft aka SSM (Swiss Sections Championship)
Einzelwettscheissen aka EWS (Single discipline Shooting)
All the above programs are shot from the 300 Meter mark from the targets
Over and above the Official Shoots we participate in we also have some Club championships not only between the members of the Cape Town club but also against the Swiss Rifle Clubs in Johannesburg and Durban.
The club programs are administered locally by the club and some of the competitions are:
Presidents Mettler Cup Metzger Stich
Freddy Schweizer Inter Town
Willy Wyman Piggy Shoot
The Piggy shoot is the clubs annual fun family shooting day. Here we use the old K31 rifles chambered in .22LR. The .22LR is a very small round and has virtually no recoil. For this reason, children can shoot this round without being scared off by a strong and unpleasant recoil. The shoot is very popular and there are normally many prizes in the form of Traditional Swiss Sausages and Ham’s.
All the programs above have various different shooting sequences, distances, and time frames to complete the program. These are best learnt on the range. There are always members available to explain how to shoot the different programs on the range. There is always a “scorer” at each shooting position who writes down the scores of the shooter. These members normally know how to adjust sights and how the programs are to be shot.
There are two main type of targets which are as follows:
The A5, A10 or A100 Target. (5,10,100 reference is to the maximum score one can achieve off one target)
The B4 Target. (The 4 again references the highest score one can shoot on the target)
So now you know what the main Rifles and Targets look like, shoot and shoot at.
We currently mainly run three different types of rifles. These are as follows:
Carbine K31 (1931) – Chambered in GP 11 – 7.5 x 55mm (Wooden Stock Rifle – Single Bolt Action)
SIG 510-0 aka “Sturmgewehr” aka StG57 – Chambered in GP 11 – 7.5 x 55mm (Black Metal/Plastic Semi Automatic Rifle)
SIG 550 aka “Sturmgewehr 90“ – Chambered in the 5.6mm Swiss GP-90 round (Green Metal/Polymer Semi Automatic Rifle with a folding stock) Identical to the 5.56mm NATO
7.5 x 55mm GP-11 Ammumition
5.6 x 45mm GP-90 ammunition
Now you know what Rifles and ammo the members of the SRC Cape Town club shoot.
Where does the SRC shoot?
The SRC Cape Town mainly shoot at the two military ranges in Cape Town. One being the SA Navy Range – Klawer Shooting Range and the other being the Army Range – Atlantis Military Range.
On occasion we make use of the Western Cape Shooting Union’s shooting range which is basically in the same area as the Atlantis shooting range.
What would a standard day on the range with the SRC look like?
Prior to a shoot day, the club secretary would send out a reminder of the shooting day approaching and ask for members to confirm their participation or absenteeism. It is necessary to know which persons will be participating on the day, as the club committee needs to supply a name list of participants for the day prior to the shooting day. Therewith, it is important for members to advise if they will be attending or not. In addition, it also assists with the ordering of sausages and rolls for the day, in advance.
On the day, members are required to arrive timeously. This in turn facilitates a good early start to the days shooting.
Once members arrive, they are required to note their presence with the administrator on the day. This is normally at the clubs shooting trailer and admin area.
Once the member has presented him or herself then they must sign in on the range register and fill in the required indemnity if not done previously.
Once the indemnity and any other forms are signed one can then approach the administration table to receive ones shooting booklet and score sheets. Here one also pays for the program and ammunition and refreshments.
Once this is done there is normally a short welcome and explanation of the days proceedings done by one of the committee members and then the range is handed over to the Range Master.
Once a member has their score sheet, book and ammo, they will then advise the Range Master that they are ready to shoot and advise the Range Master which programs they will be shooting, so that the Range Master can know which targets the member needs to shoot. The member then waits for the range master to call them up for their turn to shoot at an available shooting spot.
Once all members have shot the range will be closed and packing up will commence. Once the packing up has been completed then there is an opportunity by those members who wish to join other members for food and drinks at the club house or other. This is where many can relax after a fun day shooting and enjoy some Swiss sausages and a beer. It is always a pleasant and relaxing time where members get to chat and catch up with each other.
On occasion there will be a prize giving after the shoots, but these will be announced at the introduction earlier. These are mainly for a small portion of the local shooting competitions.
What do I wear and what do I bring to the range?
Members are required to dress appropriately for a shooting day. Normally in a long-legged pants with a neat shirt of any kind, with decent closed shoes. Some members have officially accredited Shooting Jackets, but this is not essential. Ear and eye protection is provided by the club at all shoots, but it is good for members who shoot a lot to invest in their own for their own comfort. Hats and sunscreen are optional and recommended for those hot sunny summer days out on the range. Water and soft drinks are normally available as are sausages and rolls with mustard, but members are welcome to bring any refreshments they fancy. There is a very strict no alcohol policy on all ranges and no alcohol drinking or even presence will be tolerated by the Range Master. Those that smoke are to do so with courtesy and away from all ammunition, firearms and the firing line.
Members that have rifles, ammo and other shooting accessories normally bring those for their own use. The club rifles will be available to all members who do not have a rifle or wish to shoot a different type than their own.
What are the obligations of members to the club?
Swiss citizens can join the club at anytime through contacting the club chairman or president. Non Swiss citizens can apply for membership through a members proposal. The club may not have more than 49% non Swiss citizens as members and so these places are limited. The application will then be reviewed at the AGM by all members and if the application is seconded then the person will become an official member of the club.
All members should attend the annual general meeting (AGM) and also the annual prize giving. Other than these two official events the members may attend shooting days and other events at their convenience.
On shooting days, the club members normally assist in the general days chores of setting up and packing up. This is done voluntarily by members who are able to do so, as it can be physical.
There is an annual club “Cleaning” day which is a day where all members join into clean rifles and equipment and is a great casual day for interactions and discussions between members. It is also a good way to learn the finer details about the rifles and how they operate etc.
What does it cost to be a member of the SRC?
All members are obligated to pay the annual club fee which is nominal. There is a first registration fee for those that join the club for the first time after a successful application.
Other than this there are no other obligatory fees.
The only other costs are for the ammunition and program costs on the day of shooting.
Is it safe?
Safety is a responsibility of every single person that enters a shooting range. There is always an accredited and qualified Range Officer on the range at all times during each shooting day. It is important for members to understand the rules of the range and to adhere to them. Members are to respect the instructions of the range officer at all times, and comply with their requests or commands.
Nobody may handle a weapon unless permission is given by the range officer.
Can I participate as a visitor?
Visitors are welcome to join on any given day, unless it is an official Members day only, like the Feldschiessen day. Normally a visitor will be invited to attend through a club member.
What does a person benefit from being a member of the Swiss Rifle Club?
There are numerous reasons for people to join the SRC. Some do so to enjoy the sport they love. Others to continue in the Swiss competitions and to compete against, not only other members, but also against themselves. Others join simply to be a part of a community of people who hold similar interests and the Swiss culture.
Over and above these mentioned above, being a member one can qualify as a dedicated sports shooter by scoring points through participation in the club and shooting programs. This allows one to be able to purchase a sports shooting firearm, which isa requirement of the state when applying.
Over and above this one also has the opportunity to buy the Swiss GP-11 and GP-90 ammunition for the Swiss rifles, for personal use, if one holds the relevant license.
Every 5 years the Swiss Federation holds a worldwide shooting festival in Switzerland where all Swiss Club Members can enter and shoot for their clubs’ glory! This is a great privilege for avid shooters as it is always a great event to attend.
So where to from here?If you are interested in what the club stands for and has to offer, then feel free to contact any of the club members or club committee members for an application form. We take it from there.",<urn:uuid:41c6da2f-9a3b-454a-8133-5c3d2aba1ed7>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://swissrifleclub.capetown/2023/01/,2024-02-20T23:19:25Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9460829496383667,2710,0.9519040584564209,1

The Perfect Handshake
Shaking hands may seem like a basic, common-sense gesture of the business world (especially the interview process) however, we have recently seen that this may not be so “common-sense” anymore. We want to share a few tips on the basics of the business handshake, as a reminder that the handshake affects the first and last impressions you may make on the hiring manager.
The BasicsFor many of us, handshaking is an instinctive, subconscious process. If you have bad habits, though, you may want to deconstruct the basics of a handshake to work on proper technique.
Your handshake with the interviewer should be firm and palm to palm. One to two simple pumps that last two to three seconds is best. As you shake hands, greet your interviewer with a smile and a greeting such as, “It is really nice to meet you.”
Gender NeutralitySome people make the mistake of thinking that shaking hands with a woman is different than shaking hands with a man. In the more gender-neutral 21st century business environment, this is not the case. You should employ a proper handshake as described regardless of your interviewer’s gender. A man shaking a woman’s hand differently may imply a lack of respect. A woman shaking a male hiring manager’s hand weakly may convey lack of confidence or assertiveness.
Pre-ShakeDon’t spend a lot of time stressing over the handshake right before your interview, but it is important to prepare. Make sure your hands are clean and dry before you go in for your interview. Sweaty hands are common among nervous people. Before you go in, wash and dry your hands. If you need to wipe off sweaty hands just before your interview, do so on your pant legs.
Faux PasDo not try to show dominance with an overly tight grip. It’s not professional to pump someone’s hand aggressively or to put your opposite hand on the hiring manager’s arm or shoulder. Do not shake for too long, as this leads to an awkward end. Your handshake should be clean, crisp and professional.
We hope these few tips come in “handy” during your next professional interview! For more tips check out our other blogs!

"Welcome to Tarot at Home, where we explore the mystical world of tarot cards and learn how they can guide us through life’s journey. In this article, we will delve into the meanings of two powerful cards – the Seven of Wands and the Queen of Cups. These cards possess unique qualities, and their combination brings forth a wealth of insight into the fields of love, finance, and health. So, let’s dive right in!
Individually, the Seven of Wands represents courage, determination, and resilience. It depicts a figure standing on a hill, bravely defending their territory against six opposing wands. This card symbolizes the importance of standing up for oneself, even in the face of challenges. It urges you to tap into your inner strength and hold your ground, refusing to be swayed by others. This card encourages you to embrace your authentic self and confront any obstacles head-on, ready to fight for what you believe in.
On the other hand, the Queen of Cups embodies empathy, intuition, and emotional grace. She sits gracefully on her throne, holding a cup that symbolizes her connection with her emotions and intuition. This card represents the nurturing and compassionate nature that resides within you. The Queen of Cups indicates a deep understanding of your own feelings as well as the ability to empathize with others. This card encourages you to listen to your inner voice and trust your intuition, as it will guide you towards making decisions from a place of emotional wisdom.
When these two cards come together in a reading, an interesting dynamic emerges. The combination of the Seven of Wands and the Queen of Cups suggests a unique blend of strength and sensitivity. It signifies the need to defend your emotional boundaries without losing touch with your compassionate side. This pairing encourages you to stand your ground, asserting your needs and values, while remaining mindful of the impact your words and actions may have on others. Finding this delicate balance allows you to protect yourself and those you care about, while fostering harmony and emotional well-being.
In matters of love, this combination indicates that strength and vulnerability can coexist. It suggests that you may need to assert yourself and defend your relationship or personal boundaries. However, it is crucial to remember that genuine connection thrives on empathy and emotional openness. By combining the qualities of both cards, you can create a truly loving and supportive partnership.
In terms of finance, the Seven of Wands and the Queen of Cups combination encourages you to be assertive and confident in your financial decisions. It may indicate the need to stand up for your financial interests, such as negotiating a fair deal or advocating for a raise. At the same time, maintaining emotional balance will ensure that you make choices aligned with your values and long-term financial well-being.
Regarding health, this pairing emphasizes the importance of self-care and emotional well-being. It urges you to stand up for your health needs, whether it be setting boundaries around your time or advocating for proper healthcare. By honoring your emotional needs and listening to your intuition, you can create a solid foundation for overall well-being.
In conclusion, the Seven of Wands and the Queen of Cups, when combined, offer a powerful message of strength, compassion, and the ability to assert oneself while maintaining emotional balance. Remember to embrace your inner resilience, defend your boundaries, and listen to your intuition throughout the journey of life. The tarot cards have spoken – the path to a fulfilling life lies in the harmonious integration of both strength and compassion.",<urn:uuid:839c79d6-37f6-4ee0-a5d9-90ef20dfb6e9>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://tarotathome.com/seven-of-wands-and-queen-of-cups/,2024-02-20T22:00:55Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9312447905540466,716,1.3563735485076904,1
"Business Leader Post, January 24, 2013
Thomas D. Davidow, Ed.D.
This question was posed by WealthCounsel, a publication that services the estate planning industry. The answer was to “avoid chaos and discord among family members and beneficiaries.”
Here are some additional statistics: 88% of family owned businesses say they will maintain control for the next five years; 70 % of FOB’s have more than 75% of their net worth tied up in the company, yet only 25% of their senior generation members have completed an estate plan; Less than two thirds of family business owners know the senior generation’s intentions.
There appears to be a disconnect between families’ concerns and their ability to act on those concerns. What is that about?
The planning process is difficult. It involves making decisions that have emotions at their base. One has to acknowledge and internalize the reality that no one escapes—we all have a limited time on this earth. This is a difficult reality to process.
The decisions themselves are complex. One has to weigh the all the issues—wealth, money and relationships—in the same thought process. It is common for many family businesses to not know the answers to many of these complex questions.
Families need help and guidance through the process. The planning process is best done with qualified professionals who have advised others. My message to advisors is that planning or worrying about the absence of planning is on their clients’ minds. Ask them about their “worry” and let them talk about it first before you begin planning. They need to clear their emotions out before they can begin to think.",<urn:uuid:3aca9490-a753-4aae-8792-275faa468e09>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://tdavidow.com/pages/what-motivates-people-to-plan.html,2024-02-20T21:45:32Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9845131039619446,342,1.5244444608688354,2

"Hazel's Whip or ""Freight hauler with a sense of humor""by
Murray Montgomery | |
I made the observation that not many feature stories were written in the small-town
newspapers back in the early 1900s. As fate would have it, after making that remark,
I came across several articles in the old Hallettsville Herald that I found
to be very interesting, if not downright hilarious.
Take for example the
one about a fellow known simply as ""Hazel"" - back in 1902 it seems he had several
adventures that were quite humorous and I would like to share them with you this
week. Squire Townsend, a well-known Hallettsville judge, told the story to the

before the whistle of the iron horse was heard, and freighting between this place
and Port Lavaca and
Houston was engaged in extensively,""
said Squire Townsend while in a reminiscent mood. ""There lived a man named Hazel
in the northern edge of the county, who engaged in the business.
was a big, rough fellow with a streak of humor in his composition and who was
one of the most expert men with the bull whip I ever saw. His power was the pride
of his comrade freighters.
""I remember an incident that happened in Houston
which will illustrate Hazel's deft handling of the whip. Hazel had stopped his
team of six mules in front of a hotel and
was conversing with a friend. A drummer - one of the first of that profession
in Texas - hailing from New York, was standing near
""A big horse fly lit on the ear of a mule leader. Hazel, without moving
from his lounging attitude, swung his black snake [whip] through the air, nipping
the fly from the ear, with the end of the curling lash, without touching the ear.
""The astonished drummer could not believe but what was an accident, and Hazel
offered to wager a dollar that he could pin another fly to the drummer's pants
and repeat the trick.
""The wager was accepted, a fly caught and pinned
to the drummer's pants above the knee. Hazel carefully stepped back the requisite
distance and balanced his whip. There was a twinkle in his eye and his friends
waited expectantly. Again the lash swished through the air, and mingled with the
pistol like clap, came an agonized yell from the drummer that could have been
heard half a mile.
""The lash made a keen slit in the fellow's pants and
flesh like a knife cut. Hazel paid his wager, but contended that he was due another
chance as he had slightly miscalculated the distance. Needless to say the drummer
""The same Hazel had a voice half bass and half tenor. When speaking
he would start with the base, and then break into a finer tone which made it sound
as if two distinct persons were talking.
""One evening just about dark,
while in Houston, and under the influence
of liquor, he went out walking. An abandoned well lay in his path, and it was
his luck to fall in. The well was just deep enough to make it impossible to climb
""He yelled for help and an Irish laborer came along. 'Help me out
of here,' called Hazel, his voice breaking from base to tenor. The Irishman turned
away in disgust saying, 'Faith there be two of yez, why the devil don't yez help
each other out,' and left Hazel in his uncomfortable position.""

"BY SAMUEL OYEWOLE
The area at risk stretches from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. At least four ships have been hijacked off the Somalia coast since November 2023. Concern has risen amid the Iranian-backed Yemeni Houthi group’s militant campaign of support for Hamas, the Palestinian political and military organisation governing Gaza and currently at war with Israel. Many observers suspect a collaboration between Somali pirates and the Houthis.
I have researched piracy off the east coast of Africa, counter piracy efforts and the enduring relevance of naval power. I have no doubt that the Houthi attacks have emboldened the Somali pirates. Their collaboration or at least combination is undermining security off the east coast of Africa and may not be resolved solely by military means.
The combination of Houthi maritime attacks and Somali piracy has disrupted traffic in the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and Mediterranean. Most ships are taking the longer route around Africa, and this is increasing shipping costs and lengthening shipping time, with negative implications for prices and the global economy.
The Suez Canal, which accounted for 12% to 15% of the total global trade in 2023, recorded a 42% decrease in ship traffic over December 2023 and January 2024, according to the UN’s trade and development agency, Unctad. The Suez Canal connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. For instance, shipping from the UK, east Africa’s key trading partner, mostly passes through the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea.
These developments and others have raised the cost of shipping globally by more than 100%, and from Shanghai to Europe by 256%.
The global economy incurred a colossal loss at the peak of Somali piracy. The World Bank estimates that Somali pirates not only kidnapped seafarers but also received between US$339 million and US$413 million as ransom for hijacked ships between 2005 and 2012.
The threat raised the cost of shipping, as shipping firms had to spend billions of dollars to install security equipment and hire guards aboard. They also had to pay more as compensation to endangered crew and insurance for goods. One Earth Foundation, a nonprofit organisation, estimated that US$7 billion was lost to Somali piracy at its peak in 2011.
PREPAREDNESS OF INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING
The threat of the Houthis and Somali pirates against maritime commerce has attracted international military responses. Prior to the latest crisis, the US, France and China maintained a significant military presence in Djibouti. This has since been activated and, in some cases, reinforced, for maritime policing in the Gulf of Aden. In addition, India and Iran, among other nations, have deployed warships to the region.
The US and the UK have jointly launched airstrikes to undermine Houthi capabilities and motivations for maritime attacks in the region. But the group has intensified its attacks.
But the threats of maritime piracy and terrorism off the east coast of Africa have persisted. Without confidence in the current security situation in the region, many ships have rerouted around Africa to avoid the hotspot.
Previously, the threat of Somali piracy to global trade attracted a series of multinational initiatives. These included efforts to combat Al Shabaab and reconstruct Somalia state authority to govern its territory.
Many countries deployed their navy to the region. The EU naval operation Atlanta commenced in the region in December 2008, and that of the US in January 2009. Similarly, Operation Ocean Shield by Nato, the military alliance of EU and north American states, started in August 2009. Russia, China, India and Iran also deployed warships to the region. These forces joined the regional players in north and east Africa and the Arabian Peninsula to combat Somali piracy.
Many pirates from Somalia were arrested, imprisoned and tried across the world or killed.
Consequently, Somali piracy eventually declined from its peak in 2011 to zero in 2015. Except for 2017, when attacks were recorded, Somali pirates have generally kept a low profile from 2018 until November 2023.
The current counter piracy efforts mainly revolve around military power, coalition building and diplomatic engagements. Little effort is being made to resolve the root causes and trigger of the crisis.
To address the emerging crisis off the east coast of Africa, there is a need to take a holistic approach to security in the region.
More concerted efforts are required to address the root causes of the crisis, starting with strengthening the Somali state to govern its territorial space.
Ending the Gaza war that attracted the solidarity of the Houthis, which in turn emboldened Somali pirates, is also important for the general stability of the region.

"The presidents of Somalia, Mohamed Farmaajo, and Somaliland’s Muse Bihi Abdi are expected to meet in Djibouti this week under the invitation of Djibouti leader Ismail Guelleh.
Sources also indicate representatives from the African Union, the European Union, the US and Ethiopia are expected to attend.
While the agenda of the meeting is not clear, sources quoted by VOA journalist Harun Maruf indicate the two main topics of discussion will be to build confidence between the two sides and start a process that can lead to a negotiated settlement.
Also, with the election for the non-permanent UNSC members happening on June 17, the candidature of Djibouti could be on the table.
Although Kenya is the candidate endorsed by the AU, Djibouti has contested the endorsement and has instead on remaining in the race.
Farmaajo and Abdi earlier met in Addis Ababa on February 11 his year. Two days later, Maruf says, President Farmaajo apologised for atrocities committed in Somaliland under previous governments.
“Nation needs to correct a dark chapter and apologise to our brothers who were killed, maimed in the north,” Farmaajo said.
Maruf notes that a proposed follow up visit to Somaliland by PM Abiy and President Farmaajo in February was postponed after a strong opposition from sectors of Somaliland political leadership.
“If the summit takes place it will be historic event. In a matter of days, Somalia and Somaliland will mark the 60th anniversary of independence from the British and Italian colonies,” Haruf says.
He poses pertinent questions: After 60 years, where will things go from here?
For almost 30 years Somalia insisted unity of the country is sacred. Likewise, Somaliland insisted decision to secede is sacred, non-negotiable. What could be an amicable outcome which can satisfy the two opposite positions?
Why now? The leaders of Somalia and Somaliland have met before – Sheikh Sharif Ahmed met Ahmed Mohamed Silanyo; and Hassan Sheikh Mohamud met Ahmed Mohamed Silanyo.
“Key development in this case is the external factor, i.e. pressure from high profile influential actors,” Maruf quotes sources.
Journalist Abdishakur Mohamed says the mediation of both sides is very important because they failed to agree to be reunited or allowed referendum from the public.
He however says Farmaajo takes blame because he has failed to collaborate with federal states, ad he is in the last days of his term.
Somalia politician Halane Abdulkadir says Ethiopia is always working with Somalia In pursuit of her political interests.
“I welcome any dialogue between us but no foreign intervention,” Abdulkadir says.",<urn:uuid:d3693480-4fb9-4992-aa3b-a27b40f94211>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://thebrief.co.ke/news/djibouti-president-hosts-somaliland-and-somalia-leaders-for-negotiations-under-pm-abiy/,2024-02-20T21:23:18Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9586667418479919,591,1.4204407930374146,1
"BP's Deepwater Oil Spill - Test to Continue Another 24 Hours - and Open Thread

Admiral Allen had an update this afternoon. The plan is to continue the test for another 24 hours. Other information reported:
The government has ordered additional monitoring of the area while the test continues which includes doubling the seismic mapping runs over the well site. A NOAA sonar ship has also been brought to the site to assist in monitoring the entire sea floor area around the well. The ship will make regular passes around the well looking for any hydrocarbon release subsea, and both acoustic and visual monitoring of the area with ROV's will continue. The pressure in the capping stack continues to increase very slowly and we want to continue to monitor this progress.
When this test is eventually stopped, we will immediately return to containment, using the new, tighter sealing cap with both the Helix Producer and the Q4000. Additional collection capacity of up to 80,000 barrels per day is also being added in the coming days.
Progress also continues on the two relief wells the federal government has required BP to drill. The relief well remains the ultimate step in stopping the BP oil leak for good.

"There’s a special feeling of welcome everywhere as you travel the Sunrise Trail, a scenic drive along the northeastern coast of Nova Scotia. It’s a part of everything, from the warmth of the gentle surf that caresses broad sand beaches to the friendly people you’ll meet everywhere you go.
There’s a special beauty along the Sunrise Trail, too. Gently rolling farmlands create a quilt of emerald green fields that meets the sparkling blue waters of the Northumberland Strait. Country roads wind along sandy shores with their bright red bluffs and tidal saltmarshes that are vibrant with life. Timeless towns and villages, where generations have harvested the bounty of land and sea, now wait to be explored. Gracious accommodations offer a home away from home. There are fine restaurants, colourful shops and art galleries, as well as museums, summer theatre, and a fine arts centre. Good food and festivals are our specialty.
Approx. touring distances along the Sunrise Trail:
Amherst–Tidnish 23 km
Tidnish–Pugwash 31 km
Amherst–Pugwash 44 km
Pugwash–Tatamagouche 40 km
Tatamagouche–Pictou 60 km
Pictou–New Glasgow 15 km
New Glasgow–Antigonish 67 km

"I’ve reached a point where I understand cognitively that I create my own reality, and I’m slowly getting to a point where I feel it and even believe it. I’ve been focusing on feeling good and reminding myself that there is no wrong anywhere in the Universe. I find myself clinging to those words as I await a decision which I feel will have a huge impact on my life and those of my children.
I see evidence of my growth in the way I am handling this divorce process. There have been several manifestation events where I’ve managed to shift my perspective of things I initially perceived as negative, instead viewing them as positive events happening for me. I’ve identified limiting beliefs such as “It’s important for others to view me as a good person” and “I must comply with the wishes of others in order to feel safe” and “Others can create in my reality.”
I’ve been finding ways to reduce the intensity of those beliefs, and overall I’m feeling better more of the time than ever before. But, I still find fear cropping up around the recommendation that will soon be issued by a court-ordered mediator regarding who (either my former partner or myself) will be the primary caregiver for our children.
My belief (perhaps a limiting one?) is that my children truly would be better served with me as their primary caregiver, therefore I am having trouble detaching from the outcome. How can I best prepare myself to receive this decision in a way that is aligned with my inner self, regardless of what the decision may be?
And a follow-up…even if I get the decision I perceive as “good”, i.e. that I remain the primary caregiver, another limiting belief I would like to release is that my former partner will contest it and we will end up in court. I would love to get to a place where I feel good no matter what directions this all takes…any suggestions?
Thank so much!
We are in awe of your awareness. You understand the mechanism of physical reality in terms that few know. You are a leading-edge thinker and we are delighted to embark upon this journey with you. We completely understand the place you find yourself in right now and we must put forth to you once again that this is the perfect place to start. You have raised your vibration high enough to have found us and now we are engaged in conversation. You have done the thinking and feeling work necessary to prepare yourself for the divorce and custody process. Now it’s all a matter of managing your vibration in the thick of it.
First, we will begin at the basis of all creation; your vibration. Your vibration includes within it all of your desires. It radiates out to the universe and the universe responds. You are the center of your universe, therefore the universe responds to whatever it is that you want regardless of the desires of others. Remember that the universe is focused on you and you can receive all that you want if you allow it.
Let’s imagine that you want two things; whatever is best for your children and to be their primary caregiver. Which of these desires holds more weight for you? One of them outweighs the other. Above all, you want what’s best for your children. If that entails you being their primary caregiver, then that’s wonderful. However, if that does not happen, you will still be concerned for their overall well-being. You truly want what’s best for them. This is your primary concern.
Therefore, the universe is responding to this most important desire; the well-being of your children. You can now be assured that the universe is working this out for you, for them, and even for your ex. It is all happening for you. You simply allow it to happen without resistance. If you are awarded custody, that decision is best for your children. If your ex is awarded custody, then that decision is best for your children. If it is best for them, then it is best for you, even if you can’t see it right now.
Your children chose their parents and the time and place of their birth. They made this choice because they intended certain things before they were born. They knew that their childhood with you as their parents would launch them on a trajectory to a life experience that would provide them with the basis of exploration and expansion. This divorce process is part of that trajectory.
We would not be speaking in such detail to most people, but we believe you are ready for this leading-edge conversation. It is important for you to go into this with the higher perspective. What is best for your children cannot be known by you at this time. If you were to coerce this situation so that you got what you think you want, you might alter your children’s’ trajectory. You might unknowingly cause an event which would disrupt their paths. What is best for them is also best for you, you just can’t see that from where you stand right now.
We are not saying it will be best for them to stay with you or with your ex. What we are saying is that whatever happens will be best for them and for you. If it turns out that they stay with you, you can know that this is the best possible outcome for all concerned. If they stay with your ex, you can be assured this is the best possible outcome for all concerned. It may not seem like it now, but from the higher perspective, it will be rather obvious. From the future, looking back at this time, it will be rather obvious and from that vantage point, you will be grateful that things happened as they did.
So then, what are you to do now? How are you to manage your vibration during this process? You are to become an allower. You are to feel good during the process. Most of those around you will not feel good. You will struggle to feel good. But feeling good and being in a positive emotional state of being will yield far better results. When you are aligned with the higher perspective while in the midst of turmoil, you will have access to higher level thoughts and ideas. You will say the right thing at the right time. You will be seen as reasonable and responsible. Others, including your ex, will feel comfortable around you and will feel your inner strength and calm. You will be received as powerful.
If you were to hold onto the limited perspective and allow yourself to be consumed with fear, you would sink into the lower emotional state of resistance. From this state of being you have access to lower-vibrational thoughts and ideas. You will come across as fearful and desperate. You will say and do things that contradict who you really are. You will not have the leverage of the universe backing you up. You will cut yourself off from the support that is being formed around you.
By accepting that whatever happens is in the best interest of your children, you adopt the higher perspective and you remain aligned with what you want and who you really are. From this stance you are incredibly powerful, persuasive and attractive. You attract what it is you want. From this stance you move into the easy state of allowing where everything you want can easily flow to you. From this state you are non-resistant and you project calm, ease, confidence and love. By projecting love, you will receive love. By being calm, you will receive calm. Non-resistance is extremely powerful in a situation like this.
The best way to alleviate the fear you feel is by trusting that it is all working out and by having faith in the mechanism of physical reality. This is your world. This is your experience. As long as you do not resist it, it must all be working out for you. You are loved more than you could imagine and supported by more than you could count.",<urn:uuid:b28ea3ff-7069-434c-b5da-c0203740bc3d>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://theteachingsofjoshua.com/category/one-on-one/kyla/,2024-02-20T21:16:58Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9781947135925293,1638,0.6084538102149963,1

"No man is an island entire of itself;
every man is a piece of the continent,
a part of the main;
if a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less,
as well as if a promontory were,

any man’s death diminishes me,
because I am involved in mankind.
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;

"A battery charger designed in a single-inductor single-input dual-output architecture with charge balancing among battery cells will be introduced. Charge balancing methods to reduce the charging time and slow down the aging process of batteries will be discussed. An artificial neural network is proposed to detect the state of health (SOH) of battery cells and improve the accuracy of the state of charge (SOC) estimation. A prototype implemented in TSMC 0.35-μm process and TensorFlow tools will be used as a design example.
Tsung-Heng Tsai (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in control engineering from the National Chiao Tung University in 1994, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California at Davis in 2005. In 2005, he joined the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University. Since 2022, he has been with the faculty of National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. Dr. Tsai has been a member of the Technical Program Committee of the IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference in 2014-2021. He was a recipient of the Yang Scholar Award from the National Chung Cheng University in 2017. He also serves as the IEEE Solid-State Circuit Society Tainan Chapter Chairperson for the term (2017-2020). His main research interests are in CMOS mixed-signal integrated-circuit designs for energy harvesting systems and microsensing systems.
Novel methods for frequency tracking are presented for referenceless clock and data recovery circuit applications. An approach based on an extended bang-bang phase detector (XBBPD) in a referenceless clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit. The XBBPD-based structure has a frequency tracking range that completely covers the tuning range of the digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) with a fast locking feature. In order to minimize the loop delay and thereby improve the jitter tolerance, the CDR design includes an additional proportional path that is realized by directly controlling the phase of the oscillator with the output signal of the phase detector. The design is all-digital, including digital filters that simplify the design. The CDR occupies an active area of 0.031 mm2, implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process. The receiver operates up to 12.5 Gb/s. The frequency locking time, measured as the time required for every 1-Gb/s change in the input data, is 320 ns. The power consumption is only 21.13 mW, corresponding to an energy efficiency of 2.11 pJ/bit.
Jinwook Burm received the B.S. degree in physics from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, M.S. degree in physics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and the Ph.D. degree in applied physics from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. After postdoctoral works at Cornell University and Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies, Murray Hill, NJ, he joined the Department of Electronics Engineering at Sogang University, Seoul, Korea, as an Assistant Professor in 1998, where he is now a Professor. He also worked as a Principal Scientist at Pixelplus Semiconductor, Inc., in San Jose, CA, USA for one year starting in August 2006. He worked on millimeter wave ICs and high speed GaN transistors at Cornell, and high speed optoelectronic circuits at Bell Labs. At Sogang University, his current research interests include high speed interface circuits and CMOS implementation of various sensors.
Integrated sensor fusion system-on-chips require a high-accuracy low-latency analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to interface a wide input range signal and multiplex among multiple sensor channels. Incremental analog-to-digital converters (IADCs), by adding a simultaneous reset in analog modulators and digital filters, are Nyquist-rate ADCs which retain most advantages of the ΔΣ ADCs, and are much easier to be multiplexed with shorter latency and simpler digital filters.
In this talk, IADC operation will be reviewed. Hybrid IADC to continue the residue fine quantization to improve the energy efficiency will be discussed: (1) extended counting with a second SAR ADC, (2) hardware reusing to perform multi-slope counting, (3) two-step operation to boost up the noise shaping order, and (4) multi-stage multi-step operation to boost up the noise shaping order and extend the input range.

Which bike should I hire?
In Morzine, you can spend all week riding your bike downhill, without riding on any Downhill (DH) trails. Confused? Fear not, this guide should help you choose!
DH riding takes place on graded man made trails where pedestrians aren't allowed. They will be based under a lift - going from the top of the lift to the bottom of the lift. They are graded Green, Blue, Red and Black (easy to extreme). There will be trail features such as jumps, berms, drops and ladder bridges. For this type of riding, we recommend a dedicated DH bike - the Saracen Myst Pro.
All other riding in Morzine and the Portes du Soleil is on singletrack and fireroads accessible to all comers, bike riders and hikers alike. The trails link up the lift network allowing you to travel great distances from valley to valley with minimal effort. In general you will need to pedal your bike up or along for short distances, but you'll still spend the majority of your ride going downhill. For this type of riding we reccomend a dedicated Enduro bike, the Pivot Firebird and Marin Alpine Trail XR.
If you want to explore all the trails that the Portes du Soleil has to offer but don't want to spend all day on the lifts, or you are restricted for time then an E-bike is for you. With similar capabilities to our enduro bikes but with the benefit of a motor these bikes take some of the physical effort and tiredness out of those big days out. The Saracen Ariel 50E is our E-bike.Road
Then if you fancy emulating your Tour de France hero's on the many miles of tarmac and infamous cols around here you'll be wanting to do that on a dedicated road bike. For that we recommend the Cervelo Caledonia Di2 and Scott Addict 30.",<urn:uuid:0cf5c8f7-825d-48b0-a11d-b106f55d2f51>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://toricomorzine.com/bikehire/mtb-AlpineTrail-XR/,2024-02-20T23:04:17Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9191223382949829,676,1.0711345672607422,1

"If a discussion about driving between an adult child and his or her parent is difficult, imagine how challenging an older adult’s interior conversation is when deciding whether to continue driving.
Say, you’ve reached the age of 85. Been driving almost 70 years. Maybe been in an accident or two. Only one speeding ticket on your record.
Your last physical pronounced you hale and hardly. But there are warning signs: Getting harder to park? Some scratches and scrapes you’re hiding from the family? Didn’t see a mother and her infant in the crosswalk until almost too late? Getting harder to see at night, or maybe seeing double?
(Difficult as it is to give up driving, more than 600,000 drivers ages 70 or older voluntarily stop driving annually, according to a 2002 study in the American Journal of Public Health).
Aware that ending driving can be a body blow to one’s independence, how can we know when it’s time to hang up the keys?
1. Look at AARP’s ten warning signs that tell you whether to limit or stop driving. They include getting lost in familiar places, having trouble following road signs, and reacting more slowly to unexpected situations.
http://www.aarp.org/home-garden/transportation/info-05-2010/Warning Signs Stopping.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also has a safe driver self-evaluation test. (www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/olddrive/OlderDriversBook/pages.
2. Take a vision test or any number of AAA or AARP driving evaluations.
3. Try out a virtual driving test websites like Drive Sharp. Drivesharp tests your reflexes in different emergency situations. www.drivesharp.com. Your score may indicate whether your reflexes are quick enough to continue driving.
Finally, remember the differences between an issue, emergency, and a crisis:
An issue is recognizing that your behind-the-wheel skills have declined.
An emergency might be last week’s fender bender or getting stopped by a cop for cruising past a stop sign.

Static rail vehicle inverter transformers operate under harsh conditions. Traction power supply, combined with the expectation of extreme reliability, defines the parameters and stringent requirements for the transformer insulation system. Climatic conditions and mechanical influences are additional constraints that affect the construction solutions adopted and the materials used.
The technical standard EN 60310 defines the general requirements for transformers and chokes used in rolling stock. From the point of view of transformers, the requirements of the PN-EN 50124-1 standard concerning the coordination of insulation according to overvoltage class (OVx), which determines the expected overvoltage exposure of insulation, deserve special attention. The concept of the soiling zone (PDx) is introduced, which has an impact on insulation clearances and the technological solutions used. EN 600721 classifies groups of environmental factors and their intensity at the location of transformers, taking into account impacts of climatic, biological, chemical and mechanical nature.
Mechanical impacts are an extremely important aspect in electro-mobile applications. Methods for testing the immunity of transformers to vibrations generated during vehicle motion and transmitted to equipment installed on board are defined in EN 61373. The document specifies the frequencies and amplitudes of vibrations acting in different planes on the transformer depending on where the equipment is installed on the rail vehicle.
Transformers and chokes in mobile railway applications must meet the stringent requirements of all the standards in question. The increased technical requirements make them non-standard, high-tech devices.

Design and optimisation of structures
The main optimisation objective of the work on railway transformer design is to achieve the lowest possible component weight while maintaining electrical, climatic and mechanical performance.
During development work on transformer design for railway applications, a number of
computational simulations were performed for core designs made of different magnetic materials. The simulations used the loss algorithm and temperature model used in the transformer design software from RALE Engineering GmbH .
The low frequencies of the supply voltage (approx. 1 kHz) make it possible to consider using isotropic, anisotropic sheets and amorphous magnetics for the construction of low-loss transformer cores (Table 3).
Achieving the expected level of power loss in a core made of transformer sheets is possible by limiting the magnetic induction in the core. However, this results in an unintended large increase in core mass, which is one of the most important constraints. In this situation, materials with lower losses are used. Amorphous magnets, due to the small thickness of their sheets in the case of transformers, show much lower losses from eddy currents.
The low dissipation of the amorphous material allows for adequate core losses while maintaining an acceptable device weight. However, a large magnetostriction coefficient is a problem with this group of materials. This creates an intensive sound field around the running transformer, which is an unacceptable effect from the point of view of the intended application.
The non-standard approach to the enclosure concept makes it possible to eliminate areas of increased generation or accumulation of losses causing excessive temperature increases (Figure 2).
In high-frequency applications (Table 4) we get much smaller transformer weights and dimensions. Cores in this frequency range are built from ferrites or nanocrystalline magnetics. The windings, due to high additional losses, are constructed exclusively from face-type copper conductors.
The magnetic materials used for power transformer cores in electromobility applications include soft ferrites, low-loss generator and transformer sheets, and amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys in the form of thin strip cores. The magnetic core material is selected to suit the specific power and load conditions of the transformer, the size and intended use of the device, taking into account the parameters of the magnetics, such as dissipation, magnetic saturation induction or magnetostriction.
The formation of satisfactory properties of alloys is possible through modifications of their chemical composition, crystal structure, plastic and thermomagnetic processing. In the case of low-silicon and high-silicon sheets, with an increase in silicon content, their magnetic permeability increases, losses in iron during remagnetisation decrease, leading to a reduction in eddy current losses as the resistivity of the alloy increases. The coercive intensity also decreases, thereby reducing the hysteresis loss and magnetostriction coefficient . However, the decrease in magnetic saturation induction is unfavourable from an application point of view.
Iron-based amorphous alloys are characterised by significantly higher magnetic permeability values compared to silicon sheets, with a small coercive field and lower loss. An important property of amorphous materials, from the point of view of industrial applications, is the small increase in total loss per unit mass in the elevated frequency range. These alloys are obtained in the form of thin strips by the technique of rapid cooling of the molten material on a rotating roller .
Very good so-called soft magnetic properties of amorphous alloys are related to their structure, in which there is no long-range ordering of atoms, resulting in the disappearance of magnetocrystalline anisotropy, grain boundaries and other structural defects typical for polycrystalline materials . An
unquestionable advantage of this type of material is that it is easy to improve its properties by changing its chemical composition and annealing under appropriate conditions. Striving to improve the efficiency of energy conversion and extend the temperature or frequency ranges of devices has led to the creation of nanocrystalline materials. They are obtained by partial crystallisation of amorphous alloys in an optimisation annealing process. This process leads to crystallites less than 100 nm in diameter, embedded in an amorphous matrix. This group of alloys includes well-known materials such as FINEMET, NANOPERM and HITPERM. These materials have a high magnetic permeability value of the order of 106, a saturation induction (depending on the chemical composition of the alloy) in the range of 1.2 – 1.9 T, a near-zero magnetostriction (λs of the order of 10-6), a small coercive field (HC < 1A/m) and core losses of the order of 0.1 W/kg (at 50 Hz) .
Ferrite materials are often used in high frequency applications due to their relatively low price and availability. They are characterised by a low saturation induction of about 0.4 T, low magnetic permeability and lower loss compared to other core materials.

"Basic Instincti has aged remarkably well considering it is twenty-seven years old. Can you believe that shit ? Basic Instinct is more than a quarter century old! I generally don't want to talk to girls as old as this film.
Obviously girls fucking, and especially girls mating isn't nearly as exotic, fascinating or a big deal nowadays. Now that we've fixed everyone's sex life for them, whether they wanted it fixed or not, whether they thought it was broken or not, now the pinnacles of 1992 seem... you know, ordinary urban skyline.ii Made of skyscrapers, of course, what the hell else would it be made of, hovels ? Like in the before times ?!
That aside, the story sticks together, Sharon Stone smiles well, Eszterhas writes well, pre-Tangerine production values work well and deliver well... There's a vague air of 1980sia indistinctly misting the corners, the over-cherche deliberate ""ambiguity"" towards the end grates in pre-robotics industrial product tones, but... well, what can you do ?
The corpse abundance betrays the settled circumstances of the 90s, too. Back then friendly fire was yet minimal, permitting the field to fiction. These days... who can even write about a piddly half-dozen bodybags ?! It'd be a forbidden middle -- either make it about the real events, three dozen plus randos mowed down by machine gun in an evening without thought or reason, or else go home. We can reasonably suspect no such thing as Basic Instinct will ever again be made in this language, for these reasons. Add to it the fact that it was excellent when it came out and it stayed acceptable in spite of what might as well be centuries passing over it and the bottom line comes out looking pretty good.
The independent attitudes betray the pre-female bureaucracy. Imagine that scene today where a high sexual market value female suspected of murder calmly retorts ""what are you gonna do, arrest me for smoking ?"" when asked not to smoke inside the police HQ. Do you think the fat uglies involved would let that slide ? Hm ? Good thing the pantsuited hilarity gave you your rights, then. Evidently you were living in squalor prior. Right ? What's this magical socialism you've built wherein it sucks being anything but an idle, dumb, fat, ugly woman nobody has any use for ?
Basic Instinct is just as toxic today as it was in 1992, but now it's toxic ""for different reasons altogether"" to ""entirely a different set of people"". Which is to say -- the lamers of 1992 morphed into the lamers of 2019 while the film stayed put. Once I put it like that it's suddenly very much worth seeing, huh ?",<urn:uuid:608e9cd5-8bee-4f3f-8d96-b9070025503a>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://trilema.com/2019/basic-instinct/,2024-02-20T21:36:23Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9520132541656494,585,0.5169547200202942,1

"Understanding how your consumers shop is essential. As we ease into 2021, retailers are accelerating their digital strategies and keeping their finger on the pulse of what customers want and need.
In this article, we’ll cover how businesses can utilise the data they have and use past trends to predict future ones in order to track consumer behaviour. And once businesses have done that, they can use the right platform — like Upp — to uncover their product performance data (and therefore better understand customer spend) and provide strategic insights to help achieve their goals.
Look at past buying patterns
The outstanding buying pattern that emerged in 2020 was, unsurprisingly, a growth in online shopping. Retail websites generated almost 22 billion global visits in June 2020, which was up nearly 6 billion from January 2020. Online shopping is only set to increase over the coming years with a forecasted growth rate of 34.5% by 2023.
Different industries have experienced specific online trends and fluctuations. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, certain product types have significantly increased in online retail order volumes — household hardware has rocketed by 212%, furniture spiked to 17% and consumer electronics rose by 9%. In April 2020, internet food sales increased by 83.2% in comparison to the same month a year earlier, and online worldwide apparel sales also rose almost £3 million across the year.
Analysing buying patterns and 2020 sales data in your specific industry will allow you to accurately predict how your consumers will spend in the future — crucial to business success looking forward to 2021. Anticipating customer needs makes room for you to adjust your Google Shopping campaigns accordingly.
Utilise the data you have
Online shopping has given retailers the gift of rich and readily available product performance data. Success comes down to one main thing: using it with the right objectives in mind.
The right data can be difficult to get your hands on and hard to interpret. It’s crucial to note that Google Shopping only gives you historic data, so it’s hard to predict future trends.
A platform like Upp can provide this insight and ultimately make a real improvement in your customer targeting and business goals. It will be pivotal in deducing data quickly and efficiently to put you on the right track for overall business growth.
How Upp can help utilise your data:
Understand where your business is struggling as well as thriving:
Your online store may have best sellers but you still have 0 visibility on Google Shopping. Upp exposes these discrepancies and realigns your campaigns to ensure they get visibility on Google Shopping and achieve maximum growth as a result.
Ensures every SKU reaches optimum performance:
Seeing your product performance data at SKU level can help you see how each product is performing and how this can be adjusted. For example, these insights can tell you if a product is selling well, Upp will tweak that campaign to ensure it reaches optimum performance. This can also help prevent ad spend being wasted, and ensure you’re getting a great ROI.
Become more efficient:
Is your company spending too much time managing campaigns? A platform like Upp will automate your daily tasks, like bidding and automating campaign structures, to create a more productive workflow. This will also help retailers gain strategic control over campaigns, and ensures they get everything out of them.
Be where your customers are
Successful online retail is all about being on the right channels. To put it bluntly, there’s no point spending on marketing to your customers if they aren’t there. Without investing in a platform like Upp, though, that’s easier said than done.
How Upp can help target customers:
Uncover trending products:
With customers online more, it’s no surprise that ad spend on Google Shopping has increased by 38% compared to 2019. Upp uncovers performance data around trends and product demand, allowing retailers to accelerate growth and increase profitability.
Reach all potential customers:
If Upp sees a product performing well on a retailer’s online store but not Google Shopping, the campaign will be automatically adjusted to ensure it gets the visibility it needs. This means ad spend is being utilised efficiently and helps retailers reach even more customers.
Automatically track consumer behaviour for the best results
Grasping a more detailed picture of your consumers’ previous buying habits is critical to successfully appealing to them in 2021. This is especially important with increasing online retail competition that’s likely to reach just below £100 billion in the UK in 2020 across various shopping streams.
Understanding past buying patterns, utilising the data you have access to and ensuring that you are present on the right online platforms are all crucial to business success in 2021. Managing these key areas manually, however, will undoubtedly slow your team down and limit your performance.
That’s why it’s key that you don’t pass up the opportunity to invest in a transformative platform like Upp, which will help you reach the success you’re capable of achieving this upcoming year.",<urn:uuid:e6921245-6997-4e55-96b5-02ac31ba45ac>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://upp.ai/resources/track-online-consumer-behaviour/,2024-02-20T23:15:08Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9409024119377136,1039,1.4790326356887817,1

"Navigating the endless sea of options for wedding vendors is tricky enough, but factoring in the individual collections with varying hours of coverage, deliverables and working relationship can quickly make couples feel overwhelmed about knowing which wedding photography package to book based on their own unique story, relationship, destination and event. Of course, that doesn’t change the fact that finding the right partner to create these visual heirlooms that will forever encapsulate the events and emotions of the day is one of the most important decisions you’ll make in the planning process.
Today, we wanted to provide a bit more background on what you’re actually looking for in the different wedding photography packages out there, and how to know what’s best for you. Like most things in life, one size doesn’t fit all!
Wedding Photography Coverage
While some photographers operate on a fully bespoke basis, creating a custom package for each couple they work with, most photographers will offer a few different collections for couples to choose from. These collections primarily differ by the number of hours you choose to have covered, either by one lead photographer or the photographer and a 2nd shooter/additional assistants (which will be determined by the scope of work).
While every couple’s wedding day timeline will look a little different, the standard length of time for the main events (Ceremony, Cocktail Hour and Reception) is going to be between 5-6 hours. With this in mind, the most common photography packages we see offer the following bundles of hourly coverage.
8 Hours – This coverage might work for you if your ceremony and reception are happening in the same place, you have a smaller guest count and you’d like the most important moments captured, but aren’t as concerned about capturing the details and design. Most couples are able to have their photographer capture the final hair + makeup touch-ups/getting dressed photos all the way up to the start of the dance party following dinner with this kind of package. Keep in mind, this may not allow enough time for your photographer to shoot lots of detail shots (without guests), including those beautifully styled flatlays of your fashion, accessories, welcome bags, invitation suites and other day of stationery pieces you might be hoping to have captured.
10 Hours – Perhaps the most common number of hours booked, a 10-hour photography package leaves a bit more wiggle room for important detail shots as mentioned above, as well as family + bridal party portraits. This is also an ideal scenario if you’re having a First Look or if your ceremony and reception are happening in different locations. That’s because travel time is often included in the number of hours you book. The clock starts running when the photographer arrives, so if there’s lots of drive time during the day, that will count towards your photographer’s hours because they’re technically on the job. During the reception, your photographer will likely stay for a bit more dance floor time, but not until the very end where there’s a Grand Exit or anything (unless you skip pre-wedding photos). Let’s just say that things can get sweaty after a while, so it’s typically a-okay for the photographer to leave before it gets to that stage in the night.
12 Hours – If your wedding is very design heavy, consider this kind of package as more details naturally require more time to shoot. Same goes for larger guest counts, bridal parties, family members you’d like captured. Fun fact – you can anticipate each portrait (whether it’s Couple + Parents or Bride + Bridesmaids or Groom + Best Man) to take about 2.5 minutes. Wedding days are fun (as they should be!), so wrangling people for portraits and then staging them for the shot will always take longer than you think. If you have an epic Grand Exit planned and you don’t want that to be missed in the photos, see if this number of hours works with the photographer being on-site and if not, talk to them about additional hours of coverage a la carte.
Following the pandemic, we’re seeing an increase in packages specifically for intimate weddings and elopements since these approaches to the day’s celebrations don’t always follow the traditional structure of a ceremony, followed by cocktail hour, dinner and dancing. So you may find shorter packages available to suit your needs! Typically 6 hours is a good number to capture it all, but be sure to consider your own unique timeline before booking.
Photography Deliverables After The Wedding
There are a few different ways wedding photographers deliver images once they’ve filtered and edited the best of the best for you. Some collections offer only one of the below, while others might include a combination.
Digital Files – Presented either as an online gallery or USB (sometimes both), different photographers will include a number of final, edited images in a full gallery that you can access and download anytime and share with loved ones to view. Keep in mind that an expiration date may apply. Talk to potential photographers about how and when they deliver images following the wedding, and who retains the rights for printing both now and later.
Prints – Physical copies of a handful of your wedding photos, printed on premium, chemically-sensitized paper in either a matte or glossy finish. Ask your photographer if they ultimately choose the images for the prints, or if you can collaborate with them on the selection, and discuss size, finish and border preferences as well!
Photo Books & Albums – Similar to prints, albums are composed of a selection of images from your wedding gallery, formatted in a high quality photo book or album for you to display in your home. It’s a beautiful way to look back at the highlights of your wedding day in the years to come and share stories with your guests when they visit.
Travel & Accommodations For Your Wedding Photographer
Another consideration for the wedding photography package might be travel. Typically, a destination wedding is anything over 2 hrs travel time away from the vendor’s home/studio, which will likely be outlined in their contract, so additional fees may apply for anything outside of this radius. Some photographers already include travel costs in their pricing, while others will determine an amount to charge on an event by event basis. Depending on the package you book, they may need to stay more than one night, especially if you book them for auxiliary events such as a Welcome BBQ, Rehearsal Dinner or Send-Off Brunch. So anticipate these costs as you’re considering the overall package you book as well!
If you’re working with a wedding planner, they can help guide you through this process and advise you on what questions to ask potential photographers. Typically, this will be the first vendor you’ll want to book once you have your venue and planner secured, but considering the wedding boom happening in 2022 (over 5 million weddings projected as of right now!), you’ll want to start the vetting process sooner rather than later since availability is limited – especially if you have a handful of people you’ve been dreaming of hiring for a while!
Start the search for your wedding photographer here, and be sure to consider everything from your wedding day timeline and guest count to venue locations and design details as you determine the wedding photography package to book!

"Sevilla is an absolutely fantastic place to be based for a few weeks! In addition to its wonderful churches that I wrote about in my blog post last week, it is packed with other fun sights. Our three favorite Sights in Sevilla (coming in behind the Cathedral, of course!) were the Royal Alcázar (Sevilla’s Moorish Palace), the Plaza de España (a fun outdoor area where people relax and socialize), and the Bullring.
I’ll be honest, we mostly wanted to visit the Alcázar because some scenes for next Season Game of Thrones were just filmed there. In fact, filming wrapped up just a couple months before we arrived in Sevilla! Fellow Game of Thrones fans, keep your eyes peeled during Season 5 episodes set in Dorne’s Water Gardens. Those scenes are Sevilla’s Alcazar!
Even if you aren’t a huge Game of Thrones fan, the Alcazar will still knock your socks off. (I’m being very literal. I am literally wearing only one sock at this moment.) Between the beautiful gardens, the amazing history, and the opulently decorated rooms, you’ll find something to enjoy.
The Alcazar was originally a 10th century Moorish palace, and is the oldest palace in Europe that is still in use! The Alcazar feels a bit like a miniature version of the Granada’s more famous Alhambra, but along with less fame comes fewer crowds – music to my ears!
Tourist Tip: The Alcazar has free entry every Monday for the last hour it’s open! (Hours vary between Winter and Summer, so be sure to check their website.) The line can get quite long for free-hour even in the Winter, so we recommend you arrive early if you’re planning to make that your only visit. If you love palaces, it’s worth it to just pay the full €9,50 to go in during non-free times. Otherwise, you might find yourself wishing you had more time to explore!
By far our favorite part of the Alcazar was the gardens:
Plaza de España
I’m calling it. Plaza de España is the best place in Sevilla to catch a sunset. According to the travel books, it might also be the best place to be conned or pick pocketed in Sevilla, so bring your paranoia along with your picnic.
The Plaza de España is a big square and ring of buildings that were built next to a cute Park for a 1929 international fair. There’s a big, beautiful fountain in the center of the square:
Also, you can easily hire yourself a horse and carriage ride from here:
You can also rent a boat to paddle around the small man-made moat/river, or you can just climb the stairs, enjoy the sunset, and laugh at other tourists trying to paddle around. We watched a group of three ram their boat into the wall repeatedly. Sigh.
The highlight for many at Plaza de España is the amazing tilework on the buildings.
On the ground level, dozens of alcoves are covered in elaborate tilework scenes representing each of Spain’s many provinces. If you’re in Sevilla and it’s a nice sunny day, pack a picnic and head over to the Plaza de España to relax and people watch, you won’t be sorry.
Plaza de Toros (Bullring)
This was the last touristy outing we had in Sevilla, and man would we have missed out if we’d skipped it. It wasn’t bullfighting season in January when we were living in Sevilla, so there were no actual bullfights. To be honest, I’m not sure I would want to attend a bullfight now that I know the sequence of events of a bullfight that ultimately culminates in the bull’s bloody death. However, I didn’t have any problem visiting the ring itself and learning about bullfighting in their small museum.
The Plaza de Toros is the 2nd oldest bullring still in use today. It took 120 years to build, and was finished in 1881. It costs 7 euro to visit (though you can go for free on Mondays between 15:00 and 19:00). A paid visit to the Bullring comes with a guided tour of the ring itself, as well as the museum. Our guide was fabulous, spoke perfect English, and made lots of jokes. She showed us around the ring, took us through the Museum, told us all about the history of bullfighting, showed us the Bullring’s Chapel, and ended the tour at the horse and bull stables.",<urn:uuid:4d051d5e-ff8a-4d15-a356-20ff068f504f>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://wevemadeahugemistake.com/top-sights-sevilla/?replytocom=401,2024-02-20T22:45:03Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9638614058494568,998,1.07121741771698,1

Packaged in hand-painted foldout cardboard cover with 2 inserts.
Celer have only appeared on my radar relatively recently with their release on Spekk, and they saw fit to send me this hand made self-release to listen to. NEON uses elements of sound sourced from neon light tubes, taking loops of pure instruments, then using specially sequenced sensors that responded to localised fluctuations in light colour and intensity, literally transforming light into sounds..at least that is my understanding of the 9 pieces here.
The soundscapes are mostly delicate, gauzy affairs, gently swaying pieces, like soft grass, and with curiously evocative titles like “Apathy has its own momentum”, and “Homes Between the Channels, Under the Dams”, the musical content would appear to be a transcript of something deeply personal, or unwittingly obscure. These are elegantly sculpted pieces, rich and tonal, layered, yet highly reduced and focussed, somnifacient passages that seduce and beckon us into aural neverland. Parts of Neon remind me of Keith Berry, with swathes and washes of tonalism, looped, yet subtly altering, lilting and lulling..did I say I’m loving this? Oh yes..and with the beautiful hand made packaging, this would be on my shopping list, even if Celer hadn’t graciously sent this along..Buy a copy now..
Celer’s Neon doesn’t represent a radical sonic departure from its other self-released works though the manner by which the material was generated is rather unusual. The group’s description of the process is more detailed but, in essence, sensors, pulsing lights, and custom glass tubes were used to manipulate the tracks’ loops (generated from “pure instruments” reduced to bare tones) by synchronizing them via time changes to the brightness and colours of neon lights. Neon inarguably succeeds in realizing one of the group’s intended goals for the project: the desire to document “the transformation of sound into the beauty of electroluminescence.” No matter the conceptual impetus or production methodology involved in any given Celer project, the results are uncommonly beautiful and Neon is no exception. In this case, the seventy-minute release presents nine ethereal settings whose tranquil flow of “codeine-flavored” tones both transports and becalms the listener. Track titles like “Blinking Twilight at 3 AM” convey the music’s crepuscular character and, as with many Celer releases, the package includes a brief poem and a hand-made painted cover by Danielle Baquet-Long. Muted and bleach colours stretch as far as the eye can see in these panoramic paintings for the mind.",<urn:uuid:7bb5530b-3b92-43e4-90cd-f1450e915cab>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://williamthomaslong.com/releases/neon/,2024-02-20T23:19:20Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9270725846290588,691,1.0248973369598389,1
"In order to point satellites in different directions on vehicles, you'll need to use an antenna positioner. It's powerful and provides refined mechanical movement. If you're looking to keep one of these positioners in optimal shape and performing great long-term, perform the following actions.
Verify Positioner is Compatible With Satellite in the Beginning
The very first thing you need to do when using an antenna positioner on a vehicle is to make sure it's compatible with the exact satellite you plan on using in your operations. Verifying this aspect will ensure the antenna positioner isn't forced to hold more weight and size than it's manufactured to.
After this verification, you can rest assured the positioner will support the size of your satellite and continue moving it in an optimal manner. You also won't have to worry about premature wear and tear, which would be inconvenient to deal with all the time.
Make Sure Movement Isn't Ever Impeded
For an antenna positioner to work effectively at moving a satellite in different directions, its movement needs to be refined at all times. You can maintain this performance aspect by making sure nothing ever gets in the way of the antenna positioner that would impede movement.
For instance, you need to make sure the antenna positioner is around open space and can thus move in different directional points without any restrictions. If you're in an area where space is limited, you'll want to verify movement won't be negatively affected before using the positioner for real.
Hire a Specialty Technician if Movement Issues Surface
If you ever end up having movement issues with this antenna positioner — such as it moving slower than normal or not being accurate on a consistent basis with movement — then it's a good idea to hire a specialty technician to come in and troubleshoot what's going wrong.
They can come to this conclusion quickly thanks to their hands-on training and years of field experience working with these positioners. You can also trust their repair will restore movement to where it's precise and will remain so for a long time as long as maintenance is kept up with.
If you rely on an antenna positioner for satellite operations, then it's a good idea to care for said system properly on a consistent basis. You'll subsequently get to enjoy precision movement and a long-lasting positioner that doesn't cost a lot to manage over the years.
For more information, contact an antenna positioner solution such as MilliBox.
As soon as I started a new job, I realized that I should spend a little time honing my technology skills. I wasn't that familiar with the program that the rest of my team was using, but I knew that understanding the jargon would significantly help my career. To sharpen my technology skill set, I started staying after work to practice different aspects of the software. It took me a few months, but eventually I knew the program better than anyone else at work.

TaskPaper 1.0 adds new features (and ""fiddling"" isn't one of them)
Merlin Mann | Oct 24 2007
Hog Bay Software's TaskPaper was recently released in a completed 1.0 version (previously), and if you're the sort of person who casts about for a simple way to manage projects and tasks from a Mac, this just may be your app. But, even more significantly, if you're not looking for a simple action management system -- if you're that particularly pathetic sort of character who's convinced that features like tagging, syncing, collaboration, graph paper generation, and the introduction of an onboard artisanal breadmaker are all that stands between you and getting your stuff done -- well, you may need TaskPaper more than anybody. Because, friends, TaskPaper is just about fiddle-proof, and, frankly, I know a lot of people who could benefit from that today. Here's what a simple document looks like in TaskPaper: There's your projects, there's your tasks, there's your contexts, and there's your ability to see what you've ticked off. THAT, as John Hodgman might say, IS ALL. So, first off and best off, TaskPaper is just text. Although documents created with TaskPaper will have the "" I like the clarity and simplicity of the document's formatting, and how it virtually negates the ability to fiddle. Actually, on first glance, the magic of TaskPaper may look familiar to people who have used syntaxes like Chairman Gruber's peerless Markdown. I mean it really is just endlessly portable and mungeable text; it's TaskPaper's li'l engine that turns that formatting into the hooks that let you ""do stuff"" like view by context or project, and so on. This latest cut adds tabs for doing this neato functional stuff, and I have to say it's really appealing. The approach is similar to OmniFocus -- but even more obsessively concerned with keeping the system focused solely on completing tasks (rather than grooming and feeding them for months while they grow long hair and learn how to drive a stick). Yes: absolutely -- TaskPaper will be way too simple for a lot of people's needs (including mine). But, if you're so overwhelmed with ""flexibility"" that you're getting close to throwing in the towel on an electronic system and are considering going back to paper, (while I'd never be one to stand in your way) you might want to give TaskPaper a whirl. If you love text and could benefit from the portability of a simple electronic document, it's definitely worth looking at. TaskPaper is free to try, and it'll only set you back $18.95 if you decide to buy a copy. Download 'er now. |

"When there’s one place you can improve on your treatment for your spouse — especially on your marriage?
Regrettably, if husbands have been asked exactly the question they might provide a different response than you may think. So now, I’d love to deal with a subject that I am sure will strike home for almost each of the wives on the market: defying the womanly impulse to develop into a “leaking faucet” within our husband’s lifestyles; consequently, a NAG.
As girls, I believe that it’s easy to become a routine once we frighten of needling our husbands. Does not it look as if your husband took a million reminders about the tiniest item Does not he look to want your leadership on virtually what??? The answer is NO!
I probably only lost half of you, but stick with me, women: if you try to make your house a sanctuary for your loved ones, a place emphasized by adoring camaraderie and mutual appreciation, why in the world do you wish to earn the guy to whom you combined your life uneasy there? Who are undefined needs to devote their time to the existence of a pugnacious individual each and every moment?
No girl gets married with the intent of turning into a nag. That’s actually. However, it manages to creep into so subtly! In the beginning, you do not even notice it just like a dripping faucet. Until you receive your water bill, This is. That is when you understand that it has cost you a long time. And if dripping costs you cash nagging may cost you a marriage.
In only a half months of marriage, I have noticed this happen to people. What started as the intermittent “matter of consideration” gradually transitioned into full-blown nagging. Once I discovered the look on my husband’s eyes, and I did not recognize it. I would ask him an “innocent” question concerning why he opted to push a specific path or he left with a light on at the flat, and he would find this captive of war appear on his head, like a hostage in an unfriendly land where he can not escape. That is when I understood.
However, how can I get to the stage? How can I become a nag?
Well so as to answer this issue I chose to do just a tiny bit of study to Proverbs 19:13. I wished to learn what triggers a tap. I’d no idea although a number of you handier folks out there know the reply. This made no sense for me a faucet could start to drip.
Therefore, you also do not understand anything about the essentials of faucets and if you are like me, let you fill into. Take this “Leaky Faucets for Dummies.”
Taps are based upon the physics of water stress to start with. Water pressure is what causes the water to leak out and throughout the plumbing of your faucet, such as stainless steel kitchen faucet. When you flip off your faucet, Nevertheless, you are not turning the water strain off but only blocking it. You seal off the water stream using a washer by transferring the faucet to the place dryer.
The reason that faucets drip is the washer may be damaged or worn by all of the strain of the water flowing past it. It can not create a seal In case the washer sustains wear and tear. Because of this, water can seep through resulting in a faucet. The only way would be to replace it.
What exactly does this have to do with nagging? I discovered a frequent denominator — my period with the Lord, as I reflected in my life and my patterns of nagging. That is when the nagging ends up if I’m slacking in my own time not creating time to get prayer for the Word, not starting daily based on Him. There’s the level to which my spouse is bugging and a direct correlation between my wellness. Like I do the exact same. That I have worn down and if I am not caring for myself the increases. Just like a trickle.
This is the ideal illustration of the fact the way you care for men and women, along with your spouse, is a manifestation of your connection with God. Have zero reasons to restrain or reevaluate others He’s in control and since God is their own serenity. Even though some seemingly innocent questions about why he is wearing who costume or he left the toilet chair may appear small at the moment, the continuous nagging can truly add up to some tough wedded life.",<urn:uuid:6563db5f-e5b7-4ed6-a4e3-1236456f9576>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.abicyclefortwo.com/tag/faucet,2024-02-20T23:13:44Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9669114351272583,981,0.9375344514846802,1
"The way of the trainer. There are ex–soccer players with a great sport file and a certain number of them when they retire wants to continue their soccer race like trainers, up to here all correct one. What it does not seem or so logical to me is that those old soccer players by very good that they have been, by many titles that have won or by many international parties that have played, want to become elite trainers overnight. Although it is clear that all the accumulated experience in the land game in its many years of professional practice is going to be used to them in the future for its work in the benches, but everything in due course. Perhaps like player you have been authentic crack, that there are been in highest of the step, but you leave when it and raisins to be trainer your status already is different, so there is to be lowering steps and to put itself to the tail.

This would have of knowing it some ex–soccer players of prestige who have still not known how to accept their new situation. To be trainer is another very different thing to be player and only with experience of to have been soccer player is not worth. It is necessary to study, it is necessary to prepare itself, it is necessary to know how to handle all the threads of a very difficult profession in which the trainer as director of a human group has to know how to develop in situations very it jeopardize, as much at human level as sport. He is not enough with knowing of soccer, the learning and the improvement are very ample and include many matters in which the technician must demonstrate essential knowledge for the exercise of his profession, and that does not mean that the preparation level ensures the success far from it, we already know that the ball is capricious, but doubtlessly the trainer preparation and with good warehouse of knowledge always will have more probabilities of prevailing. He makes grace me recently listen some soccer player (we avoid names) distant to say that already one is perfectly enabled to train in first division, without neither so at least to have trained nor to an equipment of young fishes. Bobby Sharma Bluestone is open to suggestions.

"Regardless of who you are and what your background is, you have to solve many problems daily. So it's highly beneficial for you to know what kind of problem you're dealing with.In design thinking, we focus on the nature of the problem a lot. And it matters. Knowing the nature of the problem sets our expectations and allows us to manage our efforts. For example, if you're dealing with a wicked problem, it's not possible to find a solution right away. You need months of research, prototyping, testing, and iteration.Then let us break down the typical problems you deal with in an innovation project. There are three types of problem in design thinking:
- Simple Problems
- Ill-Defined Problems
- Wicked Problems
BUT BEFORE, WHAT’S A PROBLEM?
A problem exists when there is an undesirable situation you want to resolve, but no solutions are readily apparent. Each is triggered by a cause and a desirable outcome is being pursued by solving it.To solve it, you use a solution out of the pool of possible solutions. Sometimes you have to use a combination of solutions to deal with more complex problems. You can think of a solution as a pathway that takes from an undesirable situation to an alternative and improved one.
1. SIMPLE PROBLEMS
A simple problem is clear in terms of our understanding of the situation. The cause and desirable outcomes are clear as well as different pathways to solving it.
Example of Simple problem
Our community and their expectations of us are growing. In order to serve them properly, we need a reliable communication channel. The problem or the undesirable situation here is the lack of communication with the community. There are a number of solutions out there like Mailchimp that help you just do that. And the desirable outcome is when you can regularly broadcast your messages to your community.
2. ILL-DEFINED PROBLEMS
An ill-defined problem is an undesirable situation that’s unclear what exactly its cause is. There are several potential causes, desirable outcomes, and solutions.
Example of ill-defined problem
We know that the number of orders has increasingly decreased in the past few months. This is our undesirable situation.We realized the traffic to the online shop has decreased drastically as well. Instantly we think of launching an aggressive marketing campaign and pour more traffic into the website. However, the cause of the decrease in traffic may be seasonal or temporal. On the other hand, by looking further in the analytics, we realize the bounce rate of the online shop is extremely high, and only 0.5% of those who don’t bounce make a purchase. Poor UX of the online shop may be another candidate for the cause of the problem.
3. WICKED PROBLEMS
A wicked problem is a vague undesirable situation about which we have some knowledge and some guesses about the causes and potential solutions.
Example of a wicked problem
Climate change!Undesirable situation: The climate is changing rapidly beyond our capacity to control it. The causes? It can be many: some of which have been proven and some have not. Wicked problems are systematic problems. Climate change is a big systematic problem and contains several subsystems that each cause serious undesirable situations. For example, poverty is one of the main drivers of climate change. When people are poor, they care less about their quality of consumption. And often it’s the cheaper products that yield more negative environmental impacts on the planet.In this article, we offered you a rundown on the types of problems you often deal with in an innovation project. We hope you find it useful. In any case, please share your feedback with us at email@example.com.

How is it possible that this episode has such a fluid animation, while some of the bubble fruits episodes looked HORRIBLE? What are they thinking, seriously?
For a filler, it was a rather enjoyable and i thought that it’s part of the story (haven’t read the whole manga).

"Ooopsie, I appear to have taken an unintentional blogging break for a couple of weeks. And at the risk of sounding like a right Debbie Downer, I'm back with a less-than-festive admission: I'm a gift-making Scrooge at Christmas! There, I said it...now please tell me I'm not alone!
It's not that I don't enjoy the festivities or the gifting aspect of the holiday, I do! But I don't enjoy the pressure to / expectation of sewing gifts for friends and family. There are just too many people to make for, meaning I'd either have to start earlier than I'm prepared to or pick 'favourites' which I just can't do. There's also the added factor that I don't much enjoy non-garment sewing and there's no way I have enough time or skill to sew clothes for others! So it's thoughtfully shop-bought gifts all around.
The only gifts I positively love making are for babies and toddlers, of which my family and close friends have produced over fifteen in two years! So making tiny Christmas gifts for tots is also out of the question, based on sheer quantity alone. But, I'm absolving myself of any guilt knowing that each little cherub gets something handmade for his/her birthday. I find gift-making for birthdays to be far more meaningful anyway...everyone gets presents for Jesus' birthday, but individual birthdays are more personal. In fact, just to prove I'm not totally selfish, here are some of the baby gifts I've made recently:
Anyway, enough about me! Are you a gift-making machine or a gift-making Scrooge at Christmas?",<urn:uuid:92e5443a-8365-4deb-9b75-f3430c414806>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.astitchingodyssey.com/2014/12/are-you-agift-making-scrooge-at.html?showComment=1420150503434,2024-02-20T22:47:51Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9719640016555786,352,0.7023001909255981,1
"I took off the Thursday and Friday after Independence Day. Why? Because I was trying to fight the calendar for being so rude. Wednesday!? Really world?
Anyway, it was a lovely extended vacation. I hung out with my family and my friend Lauren stopped by for the weekend.
My sister and I hiked the Butte:
We paddle boarded in the lake down there (scroll for photo proof). |
Lindsey channeled Zac Efron (HSM2) for this shot. |
We walked on the golf course:
We were standing at the top of that. |
We spent our days at the pool:
Yep. That is the view from the lodge pool. |
We paddle boarded:
Basically the hardest work I did during this vacation was walking up hill (The Butte) and helping wash the dishes after the many delicious meals that I had no part in planning or making.

"I haven't hosted my grands for their back-to-school dinner this year, because we have a couple of more weeks before school starts. Since some schools have already started, I'm posting last year's tablescape for my grands return to school celebration.
Our coffee table in the family room is a “high/low” table. It raises from coffee table height to dining height and anything in between. Our grandchildren usually eat at this table. I’ve had to keep adjusting the height a little higher as they have gotten older. Coffee table height makes it so much easier to photograph the table, but I’ll have to raise it before the grandchildren get here.
Do you remember when I tore a painter’s drop cloth into rectangles to use for placemats in my “burlap-ing the table” post? Those “placemats” have now become napkins.
In addition to each child’s initials, I stamped some “life lessons” on their napkins.
I try to sneak in lessons whenever I can!
A plastic, cafeteria style dish will hold their food.
The placemats (which also serve as place cards) are small, vintage chalkboards, and a piece of chalk at each place setting gives them permission to write on their placemat. Every year, they end up playing tic-tac-toe on them.
Another reason this table is great for serving my grandchildren is that it has a glass top. Spills are easily cleaned up, AND I can use “glass markers” to write an age-appropriate math problem by each child’s place.
Glass markers in the center of the table will be used for them to write the answer to the math problem, and this is one time when they will be given permission to write on the dinner table. Tic-tac toe will probably be all over the glass top too. (Grandmothers can let their grands get away with a lot when the parents aren’t around to see them!)
Each of our grands will take home a handful of pencils and pens, wrapped in slap bands that reverse to a ruler.
The school fairy sits on books in the center of the table. When my grands were younger, I told them that she sprinkles fairy dust all over the table, so that if they eat their meal, they’ll have a good school year. Now, they all start talking about it when they spot the fairy, and although they are laughing, I get the feeling they hope that the fairy dust is real!
I’m a little sad to see my grandchildren start back to school. (Hmmm, I don’t recall ever feeling that way when my children were young!) This Summer has felt soooo short to me.

"Torstar Corp., which owns The Toronto Star newspaper, is losing about $1 million a week and in desperate need of a turnaround, said Paul Rivett, who co-owns the company.
Rivett made the comments at the premier of a new documentary about the history of The Toronto Star, which has been continuously published since 1892.
Rivett said Torstar needs to aggressively diversify its revenue streams through new offerings such as online gambling to stem losses of about $1 million per week.
Rivett’s comments come as he battles fellow Torstar co-owner Jordan Bitove over the company and its future.
Rivett and Bitove are in mediation aimed at ending their partnership in Nordstar Capital, an investment company that purchased Torstar in 2020 for $60 million.
In September, Rivett filed an application in Ontario Superior Court seeking a court order to wind up the media company. In October, the two men agreed to move their dispute to meditation and arbitration.
Bitove, who is publisher of The Toronto Star, continues to emphasize the importance of the newspaper as a civic institution.
Rivett has said that it is important for Torstar to improve search engine optimization and its online content. He has also said that for a news organization such as The Toronto Star to succeed, there needs to be more collaboration between the sales and news sides of the business.",<urn:uuid:fa1070e8-7ff1-4b21-b4a4-9301f2131736>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.baystreet.ca/economiccommentary/3740/Torstar-Is-Losing-1-Million-A-Week-Says-Owner,2024-02-20T22:21:17Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9749944806098938,289,1.3178207874298096,1

A couple months ago we found out they were playing a tiny club in Anaheim on their tour but were NOT playing Las Vegas. So we planned a little trip to Anaheim to see our favorite band in a tiny club.
It was TOTALLY worth it.We drove up a day early to spend some time on the beach. The road trips are so much fun. We love traveling together.
We ate breakfast in Huntington Beach and spent the afternoon walking around and watching a surf competition. The beach is definitely what we miss most since moving here.

It's no secret that .bipolar. is heavily influenced by the Deftones. Having formed our band in Sacramento we ran in similar circles and always trailed in the shadow of the most popular band to come out of our scene.
But they cast a big shadow as they were so talented, so hard working, and such nice guys.
Especially Chi Cheng. We ran into him a couple times in our neighborhood and he was always super nice. He had a reputation for being one of the most humble and down to earth people. Almost everyone within the scene in Sacramento has a cool anecdote about meeting or hanging out with Chi.
Among our personal experiences two stand out the most:
In 2006 the Deftones played a last minute free show at Cesar Chavez park. Brian was hanging out backstage with some friends and he watched Chi's son Gabe collect every broken drumstick that Abe tossed aside.
In 2007 we played a show at the Blue Lamp downtown with Will Haven. Abe and Chi watched our whole set and chatted with us after. All of us were stoked to say the least.
His accident happened the year we moved to Las Vegas. We kept up on his progress through the site. Not a day went by without us thinking about him and hoping for his recovery.
In 2010 when we attended NAMM we were exhausted heading back to the hotel to sleep when I stepped on a flyer on the sidewalk that had Chi's face on it. I picked it up and it was for a benefit show for him at the Slidebar in Fullerton. Fate wanted us there and who were we to deny fate? We hung out with fellow musicians who all felt as we did about his recovery. It was an experience we were meant to have.
We're deeply saddened by the loss of Chi. He was a huge inspiration and will never be forgotten in our hearts.
Much love to the Cheng family, his Deftones family and everyone else whose heart aches at this time.

Jason and Steve had both played in a band called Logicseed that Brian and I had played shows alongside in our previous band Shovelfist.
They had come in to audition with us knowing the three songs on our Dumbcane EP and without hesitation they were instantly the other half of .bipolar.
After the Sammie win the News & Review announced it by falsely saying we had broken up. They wrote a retraction after I sent them a note about the lineup change but they never did an interview with us and I always felt it was a snub of sorts.
We quickly had enough songs to start playing shows and played our first show back (.bipolar. version 2.0) at the Pine Street in Livermore only 2 months later.
In August we started recording a new EP entitled Worn & Faded. It featured the songs Hand In Hand, Lopsided and Diotima's Anguish. Diotima's to this day is one of my favorite songs that we've done. I wrote the lyrics about my life at 12 and 13 years old living in the high desert of Southern California and the struggle I had with my father and his wife at the time.
It's been nine years since I wrote those lyrics and they still make my stomach turn every time I hear that song.
The song writing with Steve and Jason seemed to flow so effortlessly. We were all in the same mind set and we knocked out songs we all loved quickly. We practiced three times a week and played shows as often as possible. Trying to get our new music out to anyone who would listen.
In October of 2004 we were able to book one of the most historical venues in rock history; The Whisky A Go Go in Hollywood.
One of the stipulations of playing the show was having to sell sixty tickets at $10 a pop or pay for the tickets ourselves.
Luckily Brian has a knack for selling tickets right before the show and we broke even. He even sold tickets to a writer who was there to review us. We also had some good friends who came with us and lived in the area. They helped us canvas the Hollywood strip and sell tickets to tourists before the show.
It was Halloween weekend, a Friday night and the crowd dug us. We put on a great show even though we were all nervous as hell. It was one of the few shows I shook all the way through the first two songs. Back then I was still very unsure of myself onstage and didn't have much of a presence there. To be on a stage I know had once been graced by Jim Morrison, I felt completely unworthy.
Sacramento at this time started to get a lot of new all ages venues that doubled as churches. So bands like us had to sign agreements before we walked on stage promising not to swear, or blasphemise to the youth in the crowd. They would pray before we went on stage.
It wasn't really as bad as it sounds considering the shows were always packed and we sold more merch at those shows than any other time. One of my favorite shows of all time was when Ghostride covered Slayer's God Hates Us All, and no one knew but the other bands.
The bands within the scene at that time accepted us really well and we networked with many. Some of our favorites were Ghostride, Red Tape, Revolution Smile, Abominable Iron Sloth, Save and Continue, and Burn Heal Scar.
All of the bands coming out at that time were really talented and we felt so lucky to be amongst their ranks.
We also started to get some love from 98 rock. They choose us as band of the month for March of 2005 and played us every week for the month. At the end of the month we got to play an acoustic version of our new song (at the time) Midway.
We were at our height. Good shows came easy and we had a solid following of fans at every show we booked whether in Sac. or the Bay.
We had more than enough songs at this time to work on a full length cd.
Even though we had a decent draw and played what we considered great shows we still weren't getting attention from any labels, and the band could barely pay for itself. We all had important day jobs, Brian and I were married, Steve and Jason had serious relationships and the band seemed to be put further and further in the background of our lives.
So in the middle of recording the full length, playing lots of shows, Brian and I decided to release the pause button on our relationship and take the next natural step of being parents.
I was forthcoming with Jason and Steve; letting them know our decision and my plan that once pregnant I would only be away from the mic for three months.
We wrapped up the full length which we named ""All remembering was in vain..."" over the next few months. Then I found out I was pregnant. My doctor cleared me for singing for seven months into the pregnancy and I wasn't ready to slow down.
Steve and Jason started jamming with their old drummer and Brian was working on a side project as well. All agreeing that these would only be temporary projects during the scheduled three months of downtime for .bipolar.
We continued to play shows on a regular basis. We had two shows booked for one weekend in February and right before I got sick with pneumonia and with a 103 fever my doctor told me NO! I had to go home and rest or my body would choose me over the baby. So for the first time, and against my control my pregnancy had gotten in the way.
I think this was the sign that Jason and Steve took to make a decision that would change everything a month later.
Then we booked our CD release show for March 10th at an awesome new club in Downtown Sac called Junta.
With persuasion from my band members, one of them being my husband and child's father we had decided to make this my last show until after the baby. Forcing me to take more than the scheduled three months off as my baby was due in July.
We promoted the hell out of that show and the venue boasted a capacity of four hundred. I'm pretty sure that night we filled up the place with almost three quarters of the maximum.
It seemed that we had more people at that show than we had at any show prior. Friends were singing lyrics right into the mic with me and strangers were video taping some of our songs that would later end up on YouTube. When we were finished with our planned set the crowd chanted for more, we pulled off one more and then the crowd chanted my name as I crashed exhausted on the nearest seat.
I think a lot of those people expected that show to be my last, and maybe .bipolar.'s last, mostly because no one expected me to be able to pull off motherhood and fronting a band.
We slimmed down our practices to once a week or so. I needed to keep the conditioning of my voice up and we didn't want to lose interest in the many songs we had written together over our two years in this version of .bipolar.
Little did Brian and I know that Steve and Jason had lost interest probably the instant I had announced I was pregnant.
Brian showed up at practice one night while they were moving their gear out of our rehearsal room.
They didn't say a word to him but left a note on his drum stool explaining that they ""just weren't that into .bipolar."" any longer.
I was crushed. The guys were like my brothers and I completely didn't seeing it coming. I had been talking to Jason almost on a daily basis like my best friend and he never once mentioned that they were losing touch with what we were doing or the plans that we had for after I returned.
This felt like being dumped. AGAIN. Each time this happened I would tell Brian. ""I'm done"" I didn't want to feel rejected every 1-2 years and be blindsided by other people's decisions that took my dreams, my passion, my blood, sweat and tears in their hands and flushed it down the toilet like it wasn't worth a shit to them.
But now, six years later I can see that they probably just didn't expect me to return to the stage and the mic after becoming a mother. They moved on with the project they had started and I dealt with the future of my band and not knowing if we would be able to find another guitarist and bassist while I was pregnant. It was hard enough to find musicians that wanted to be in a band with a female singer, let alone a pregnant female singer.

"Yesterday, I reviewed THE WEDNESDAY SISTERS by Meg Waite Clayton; and I loved it! I was just thrilled when the author agreed to answer some questions about the book for me.
Booking Mama: What prompted you to write THE WEDNESDAY SISTERS?
Meg Waite Clayon: I wish I could say I set out to write a novel about friendship, or about how the women’s movement changed the world, or about the struggles so many women go through today, which aren’t so different from the struggles women have always faced. But the truth is it’s very daunting to start a novel—a bit like getting up one morning and running a whole marathon without any training. So everything I write starts more modestly, with some little nugget of something I find interesting, that I want to explore.
THE WEDNESDAY SISTERS started as a title. I can’t honestly remember where it came from, but when it popped into my mind I loved it. Not a word of the story came with it, though, so it sat as an empty file in my computer for over a year. The story itself started with a single nameless, faceless, character, just a character trait, really: white gloves. I had no idea who wore them or why she might be a “Wednesday Sister.” There were a lot of elements rolling around in the back of my mind, but I did have the idea that it would be a friendship story. As I was writing it, I kept in my journal a photo from when I was in law school: my roommate Darby and me sitting on our balcony after my last second-year final, raising our glasses to our other roommate, Jenn, who’d poured the wine and didn’t hesitate to capture me at my worst on film. (Darby, of course, looks great!)
Booking Mama: The story takes place during the late 1960s and early 1970s -- a fascinating time of history for our country. You are too young to actually remember many of the events mentioned in your book. Why did you choose for the book to take place during this time period? How much research did you have to conduct before writing this book?
Meg Waite Clayton: When I was in law school a friend—I think it was Liza Yntema—took me into a room somewhere in Hutchins Hall to show me some old Michigan Law School class photos she’d found, to show me how few women there were in classes not many years before us. It was definitely an “aha” moment for me. I don’t think I had a clue what a difference the women’s movement had made in my life before that. That was definitely something I wanted to explore here: the shift the movement provoked in the way women—many women or maybe even all women, not just those who would call themselves feminists—think of themselves.
I could go on and on about that.
But part of why I wanted to explore this is that I think how we judge ourselves as women still has some way to go. For example, although we don’t gather around the television to watch the Miss America Pageant in anywhere near the numbers we used to, the media image of how women are supposed to look seems only to have gotten thinner and more airbrushed and unrealistic. We seem to be stuck in this ideal of womanhood as Virgin Mary perfection that no real woman can live up to.
As for research, I have a huge three ring binder overfull of things I’ve collected. I pored through magazines and newspapers from the late 1960s, picking out clothes and hairstyles they would wear and trying to imagine which articles they might read and what they would think of them. I went through bestseller and top-forty lists and watched the lunar landing footage, old Tonight Show clips, and old movies. (All great fun!) I got the kind and patient staff at the library to drag out files on Palo Alto history for me. I looked at a million photos. And for the things I hadn’t personally experienced, I relished opportunities to touch base with someone who had. I love research because it not only illuminates the things I don’t know, but also leads me to new launching pads.
Booking Mama: I related to so many of the characters in this book, and I'm sure women who read the book will feel the same way. I especially felt an affinity with Frankie moving to a new city and having to make new friends. What character do you most relate to (if any) in the book? Are there any autobiographical aspects to this book?
Meg Waite Clayton: I certainly relate to Frankie in the moving-to-a-new-city anxiety. I’ve had a lot more practice with it over the years than she has, but that has never made it easier!
The Wednesday Sisters isn’t autobiographical in a strict sense, but the heart of the book—the Wednesday Sisters’ friendship—definitely draws its emotional roots from my own friends, and in particular my friend Jenn DuChene, my husband, Mac Clayton, and my long-term writing pal, Brenda Rickman Vantrease. Let’s just say I could not have written The Wednesday Sisters without them. The joy the Sisters share is the same kind of joy I have gotten from all the many friends I am blessed to have, joy I hope I return to them. This book is absolutely meant to be a halleluiah to friends.
Each of the Wednesday Sisters does contain some little piece of me. Linda’s fear—for her children and for herself—is my fear. Brett’s tortured relationship with her “unfeminine intellect” draws on my own discomfort as a girl who was talented at math when girls weren’t supposed to be. Kath’s darkest moments draw from a relationship of mine that ended unhappily. Frankie’s self-doubt and her chubby phases are mine, as is her experience with her first novel. Even Ally is me in her middle-of-the-night journey at the end of the book, drawn from my own experience as a mom.
When I first started writing, I think I most related to Linda. But by the time I finished I felt so very close to all of them that picking one over any of the others for anything would be almost like choosing one of my sons over the other—which I couldn’t imagine doing.
Booking Mama: All of the Wednesday Sisters agree to start writing, but they all go about the writing process in different ways. For most of the women, their writing acted as therapy for them and helped them to cope with their insecurities and disappointments in their lives. What are your reasons for deciding to write after practicing law for years?
Meg Waite Clayton: Growing up (isn’t that when most dreams start?), I was a huge reader. I dreamed of writing books like A Wrinkle in Time, but to me writing novels was like leaping tall buildings in single bounds. The adults I knew were businessmen—not even business women; the “ladies” were moms and teachers and nuns. Even a girl going to law school was a stretch. My husband, Mac, was the first adult to whom I admitted my childhood aspirations to write, and he gave me a great big push. He said, basically, “Your dream, Meg. How will you ever know unless you try?”
Booking Mama: I loved the symbolism that you incorporated into the novel, especially the parts about the Miss America pageant and the space flights. Why did you choose to incorporate these events into your story?
Meg Waite Clayton: One of my earliest really vivid memories is of watching Neil Armstrong step out onto the moon. And I am as guilty as the Wednesday Sisters of watching Miss America. It would be hard for me to write about the 1960s without touching on them.
So they were there in the first draft, and the trick for me in revision is to sort out the weeds from the flowers, and to make room for the flowers to grow.
I suppose those two elements were appealing to explore beyond that first draft because they represent different ends of the spectrum. So many girls grew up aspiring to be Miss America, but there were also girls like Brett (and me!) who thought one of the coolest things in the world was an astronaut. The Miss America element allowed me to explore that whole over-emphasis on women’s physical beauty, and to show how the women’s movement raised awareness of that even in women who would not in a million years call themselves feminists. And the space race allowed me to explore the things women couldn’t do. They simply could not become astronauts any more than they could board the male-only “executive” flights that existed at the time.
I think the race for the moon in some ways represents the future, too. The possibilities. As Senator Clinton said in her speech the other day, we’ve now seen fifty women launched into space. One of the things I found most interesting about that is that I didn’t even know it until I heard her say it: women routinely fill so many roles from which they were once excluded that we don’t even keep count anymore.
Booking Mama: I was wondering if you are a big sports fan? You mention the ups and mainly downs of the Chicago Cubs baseball team as well as lots of information about the Olympics and running. I am a huge sports fans and it was so nice to see so many sports references in a ""woman's"" book.
Meg Waite Clayton: Let’s just say that for my 20th anniversary this summer, my husband and I are going to a Cubs game with our sons, my father and several of my brothers and their families. And I once called to excuse my sons from school for “an important family matter” without mentioning that the matter was a Cubs game.
I loved playing softball and almost any sport when I was younger, and though I don’t participate in team sports beyond the occasional family touch football game these days, I spend plenty of time running. I’m currently training for the Nike Women’s half marathon with Team in Training. (I’m really slow, but I’ve never failed to get to the finish line!)
Booking Mama: I am always asking everyone I meet this question because I am constantly looking for new book ideas. I hope I'm not putting you on the spot, but who are some of your favorite authors and what are some of your favorite books? What book are you reading right now?
Meg Waite Clayton: Right now I have the great pleasure of reading an advanced reader copy of Michelle Richmond’s novel coming out June 20, No One You Know. It is terrific! I quite expect to see it on the bestseller lists, as her The Year of Fog was.
I have this idea that my taste in literature generally leans heavily toward women writers and strong women characters, but I’m not sure my favorites list supports that. I love Jane Austen and George Eliot and Harper Lee and modern women writers like Alice McDermott and Anne Tyler and Barbara Pym. But I also love Tolstoy and Graham Greene and Ernest Gaines, all of whom are men who write largely about men. I suppose I like well-written books that dig right into my heart, books that make me laugh and cry.
Booking Mama: What are you working on now?
Meg Waite Clayton: I’m finishing up the first draft of a new novel currently called “Untitled Catholic Story.” At the moment, it is definitely drivel, but I’m hopeful there is a story that can be pulled out of the muck.
Booking Mama: What would you like readers to take away from your book?
Meg Waite Clayton: Two reviews posted on Library Thing embody exactly what I would like readers to take away from The Wednesday Sisters. One said after she finished the book, she picked up her own pen for the first time in years. The other said, “…when I finished, I emailed all of my best girlfriends just to tell them I love them”—which caused me to pick up the phone to call my own friends!
I'd like to thank Ms. Waite Clayton for agreeing to be interviewed by me. I appreciate the time and thought she put into each of her answers.
I just happen to have an extra copy of THE WEDNESDAY SISTERS to share with one lucky reader. If you are interested in winning a copy of this book, please leave a comment (with youre e-mail) after this post. To double your chances, mention it on your blog with a link back here. The contest will be open until Saturday, June 21st at 11:59 p.m. I will announce the winner on Sunday, June 22nd.

"Richard Cantillon (1680-1734), an Irish economist, has claims to be regarded as one of the most outstanding analytical economists of the eighteenth century. F. A. Hayek wrote that Cantillon was the first to fully articulate economics as a science. In the Essay, Cantillon outlined an extraordinary model-building approach showing how the economy could be built up, through progressive stages, from a command, barter, closed economy to a market economy, which uses money and is open. He produced some outstanding monetary theory including what Mark Blaug called the Cantillon effect when demonstrating the effects of monetary expansion on inflation, output, and the balance of payments. He also highlighted the difficulties created by excessive financial innovation for a real economy and outlined the dangers of foreign borrowing by a country. Though written in the eighteenth century, the Essay has a considerable resonance for a twenty-first-century audience.",<urn:uuid:fad6a078-7410-4c4f-8d1e-fb44eb9c2fee>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.brodgarandmulligan.com/reading-material.php?pgn=2,2024-02-20T21:51:05Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9577216506004333,183,3.3938403129577637,3
"I’ve spent thirty-some years thinking about feeding myself, almost a decade thinking about feeding one growing boy (hubs), and now am starting a journey of thinking about feeding another small human! It is super fun for me, but I recognize not everyone thinks so.
There are so many decisions to be made when feeding baby, the first of which is breastfeeding, formula feeding, or a combination. There is no wrong answer here, fed is best! Not everyone can breastfeed, and not everyone wants to. These are all valid reasons. We ended up doing a combo, with mostly breastfeeding and supplementation with formula, and it worked for us.
Of course, the next step is solids!
And this changes everything. Not to get too graphic, but the daily presents in the diaper change drastically. It can also change baby’s sleeping patterns, and if you are breastfeeding it tips off another round of emotional and hormonal readjustment for mom.
But boy is it fun!
Now baby can eat at the table or high chair, just like you. Well, sort of. Baby needs to start slow before they gnaw on their first ribeye or caesar salad. They start out with very well cooked and finely mashed or pureed foods. Typically, rice cereal or oatmeal.
“How do you know if your child is ready for foods other than breast milk or infant formula? You can look for these signs that your child is developmentally ready:
- Your child can sit with little or no support.
- Your child has good head control.
- Your child opens his or her mouth and leans forward when food is offered.” (CDC.gov)
But the good news is, that doesn’t have to be baby’s first food, or only food. Babies can eat almost everything we can! It just needs to be the proper texture based on their age and ability. Sometime between 4 months and 6 months of age, you can start down the food-splatter-lined road of solids.
*Disclaimer: I AM NOT A DOCTOR. Please talk to your pediatrician about what, how, and when to feed your baby.*
The first thing you feed your baby can be pretty much anything, as long as it is well cooked, and pureed. If you want to also strain it, to remove any chunks, you can do so. We did not, I think we went with cooked brown rice that was put through a blender. But we quickly moved on to sweet potatoes, black beans, broccoli, and more.
Basically, whatever I was cooking for dinner or for the week, I kept a little extra aside and cooked it a little longer. For example, steamed sweet potatoes, I’d let an extra one boil just a bit longer, or remove our broccoli when still a little crisp but leave a few florets to steam. Then I’d toss the extra-soft stuff in the food processor, or use my immersion blender if it was cooked in the instant pot/crockpot.
I had gotten some used silicone ice cube molds which turned out to be perfect for the occasion, but any ice cube tray would do. You could even use old egg cartons if you’re feeling ridiculously thrifty!
I started doing this around 2 months of age, and then put the food cubes into labelled baggies in the freezer. That way, by the time he was about 4 1/2 months, we had quite a variety of foods in stock. And I just continue to do this, adding to my stash here and there as I find sales or notice a particular food type/color is running low.
I try to make sure he gets at least 1 green veggie (zucchini and broccoli are favorites), at least 1 orange veggie like carrots or pumpkin, at least 1 protein (beef, chicken, beans), and some rice cereal for the iron. He usually gets some kind of fruit for dessert, banana, pears, applesauce, blueberries…
As he was first trying new foods, I gave him one cube, once a day, for 3 days in a row. This is to make sure if he has a reaction, we know what it is he is allergic to. Once foods were given with no reaction, then I could start mixing them.
His appetite also started picking up, where by month 5 he ate 2-3 cubes twice a day, and by 6 months at least 3 cubes 3 x a day, usually more like 4 plus a little bit of whatever I was eating.
Sweet potatoes and squashes are a steal year round, but around the holidays they go even lower, so he has had sweet potatoes or pumpkin almost every day. We were given a big bag of pureed pumpkin by a neighbor, so that huge volume will last a long time and was free for us!
Bag of frozen berries, 8.99 for 10 cups. 1/2 cup made 12 cubes, so each cube = 0.037 or roughly 4 cents. And berries are among the more expensive things he eats. Broccoli is usually on sale 0.99/lb, and one pound of florets makes 20 or so cubes, so about 5 cents. But I can also use frozen broccoli, which is even cheaper per pound and has the same amount of nutrients.
And now that he has tried many foods with no problems, I can mix them together as well. For example, I mixed a cup of frozen cherries, a can of sliced beets, and spinach together into a sweet, bright red puree. He LOVES it! And gets a crazy amount of nutrition from one ounce of food.
Let’s say homemade baby food ranges from 0.01 – 0.10 per cube, with an average of 4 cents.
Month 4 = 1 cube per day x 30 days = $1.20
Month 5 = 5 cubes per day x 30 days = $6.00
Month 6 = 10 cubes per day x 30 days = $12.00
So, three months worth of baby food for only $19.20! That’s not a bad deal at all.
Now, this is as far as we’ve gotten, but I assume his appetite will only increase. However, he can now eat finger foods, and more chunky textures. So I will no longer need to puree and freeze things, merely set his portion of dinner aside before adding any salt or sugar (spices are totally fine).
Let’s assume he adds just about ten bucks per month to our usual grocery budget, at least for a year or two. By then all babies are eating regular food (hopefully) and no longer needing the jarred variety. And I’m sure the food costs are just exponential from there, if his love of bouncing is any indicator of how active he will be!
In contrast, the baby food at the grocery store near me has a range of prices, based on brand, volume, and whether or not it is organic. But the lowest priced baby jar I saw was 0.99 for about an ounce.
So let’s say baby eats one per day Month 4, two per day Month 5, and 3-4 per day Month 6, plus the occasional puff, squeeze pouch, or cheerios. Those add another $5 per week.
Month 4 = 0.99 x 30 =$29.70
Month 5 = 0.99 x2 x 30 = $59.40
Month 6 = 0.99 x 3 x 30 + (5×4) = $109.10
In just three months you have spent $198.20 on baby food!
Not to mention the dozens of glass and plastic pouches, containers, squeezes, lids, labels etc.
By making our own baby food, we saved approximately $179 in the first three months of solids!
Now, don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with store bought. I am not out to shame anyone. There is a huge convenience factor here. When you need to feed baby on the go, you need a container. And sometimes you just don’t want to cook. Or you want baby to try something new. These are all fine reasons to go for the gerber.
We have some pouches and containers at the ready in the pantry, because sometimes baby wants food NOW and he cannot possibly wait the 33 seconds for the cubes to be heated up. Or I want to add juuuust a little something more, so a splash of pear sauce will round out the meal. Or I just want to keep him quiet for a second with store brand cheerios. THAT IS OKAY TOO.
But, it is not just about the money.
I also care deeply about what we put into our bodies and how it impacts lifelong health. A large part of why I wanted to make my own baby’s food is that I try to also make all the adult’s food too, and make it the healthiest possible option.
Baby food is something I would trust more than adult food in general, as we usually care more for infant health (sad but true). And most baby foods are carefully regulated to not contain many of the dyes, pesticides, chemicals, etc that can be found in “regular” processed foods like sauces, pizzas, bread, cereal, and more.
But even on one-ingredient baby foods, I find myself wondering how it was processed, was there high heat and pressure? Did they deplete nutrients? Where did the carrots come from originally?
When I make it myself I no longer have to wonder.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has an interactive timeline on reported feeding habits of babies in their first year. Unfortunately it reports some discouraging trends, like a drop off around 7-9 months in fruits and vegetable consumption as non-nutritive finger foods are introduced (puffs, rice snacks, crackers, etc) and an increase in TV watching/ mobile device exposure.
“The recent Institute of Medicine Report Early Childhood Obesity Prevention Policies highlights what pediatricians know and have been struggling to address. The obesity epidemic is reaching our nation’s youngest children.
- Almost 10 percent of infants and toddlers have high weights for length.
- Slightly over 20 percent of children aged 2 to 5 are overweight or obese.
- Approximately one in five children is already carrying excess weight as he or she enters kindergarten.
- Children who are obese at age six have been found to have a greater than 50% chance of being obese as adults, regardless of parental obesity status.
Additional literature suggests that the acceleration of the obesity problem occurs in the first years of life as lifelong dietary intake patterns, eating habits, sleep routines, and food preferences are established.”
So, whether you feed baby homemade foods or not, you should try to err on the side of variety. Make sure your baby (and you!) has a wide variety of colors throughout the day and the week. Every food has a different palette of vitamins and minerals, and you need balance over time to make sure you get them all.
Aim for 4-5 different fruits and vegetables every day, and as many as you can handle! No upper limit. And try to fit some movement into your day, whether that is doing “baby-ups” to work your arms and entertain baby, sit ups to play peek a boo, or a relaxing walk with the stroller or baby carrier. You will both feel great!",<urn:uuid:3e6c5eeb-893f-43b9-880f-b84efeda316e>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.budgetepicurean.com/jp.php?pickup/V790005,2024-02-20T23:56:28Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9648624062538147,2408,2.131514549255371,2
"The Otjozondjupa Region
Otjozondjupa is one of the thirteen regions of Namibia. An outstanding landmark within this region is the Waterberg.
Grootfontein, Otavi, Otjiwarongo, and Okahandja are linked by rail and by the main trunk road running from south to north. Communication systems between these areas are also of a high standard.
The farming activities of Okahandja and Otjiwarongo are homogenous as these parts are well known for cattle farming. The Otavi and Grootfontein districts, and to a lesser extent also Otjiwarongo, are the granary of Namibia. The region also has a great potential to establish industries connected with such farming activities and by-products of it. It further has the advantage of combining communal and commercial farming in the same region.
The infrastructure of the region is such that effective administration is possible. The state of development in the area, and the facilities available, form a solid basis for future development. This region has the potential to be economically independent.
In the east, Otjozondjupa borders the North-West District of Botswana. Domestically, it borders the following regions:
* Omaheke - southeast
* Khomas - south
* Erongo - southwest
* Kunene - northwest
* Oshikoto - north
* Okavango - northeast
Otjozondjupa borders more regions than any other region of Namibia.

"How To Install A Yard Sign
When it comes to installing your yard signs, you’ ll find that they are very simple to assemble and install.  You simply place the sign over the frame or wire stakes and insert them in the ground.  However, you may find that the best strategy for a successful campaign is to enlist a large team of people, or even pay campaigners or a youth organization to install them for you.  Once you determine the areas where you will install your signs, choosing either a team of volunteers or paying for workers is the best way to ensure that they are installed quickly and effectively.
Installing political yard signs is a huge part of your campaign strategy.  You should never begin to install them without devising a plan.  Always make certain that you check with your local government zoning rules and restrictions and only install election yard signs in designated areas.  Since a substantial part of your campaign success rests on not only installing your yard signs, but also ensuring that they remain in their designated locations, you may find that creating a map and using pushpins is a great way to keep track of where your campaign signs are located.",<urn:uuid:b8f9f49c-f6d5-4f80-a5ee-9001b2918690>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.candidatesigns.com/Install-YS-CC-ExtraPages.html,2024-02-20T21:44:31Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9562476277351379,233,1.3965213298797607,1

"Many other betting exchanges have sprung up in the wake of BetFair’s popularity. BetFair’s popularity has made it a popular choice for professional punters, including traditional bookmakers. This has increased the competition for back betting. Many lay bettors have decided to switch to exchanges that offer better odds. There are many betting exchanges today, but there are many things to consider when selecting a betting exchange.
A successful betting exchange is only possible if there are enough participants. Exchanges are based on matching a lay betor (one who “lays” a bet that a team would lose) with a back bettor. The more participants, the greater the chance of having his bet matched. There is no match if there isn’t a matching bet. There are hundreds of betting exchanges online, but in order for a punter to succeed, they must be able to use an exchange that has a lot of activity or participants. Online research can help you determine the level of “action” on any exchange.
You should also ensure that the exchange offers a lot “action” on the right sports. While most exchanges allow you to wager on many sports, there are some exchanges that offer betting only on certain sports. Some exchanges offer more action on European and World Cup soccer betting than others. Others, however, are focused more on English football. It is important to find the exchanges that offer the best “action” in a particular league. You can often find this information by searching online forums that are focused on your preferred sport.
Some exchanges may also focus on specific markets. This can be a problem, especially if the betting terminology is different. For example, in Australia, where some terminology is different or in Germany, it can be helpful to focus on an exchange that caters specifically to your home market. This will help avoid misinterpretations and poor bets. Online forums that are focused on the national gaming market can help a punter find exchanges that cater for his market.
The exchange’s commission policy is another important consideration. The top exchanges charge a commission on winnings. Since a bet is only made once a lay and back bettor have matched, there will always be a winner and a loser for every bet. It is essential to understand the exchange’s commissions in order to make profit and place responsible bets. Many exchanges offer a sliding scale to determine the amount of commission they charge. This is based on the amount of activity. The lower the commission, the better. This is not the case for all exchanges 라이브카지노. Before depositing or joining an exchange, it is important to read the commission policy.
These are only a few of many key factors that smart punters should consider before joining an exchange. While there are many factors to consider, the ones listed above are the most important. It is crucial to do your research before you make a decision about which exchange to use.

"HERO OF BABYLON 1962 ('63) aka L'EROE DI BABILONIA aka BEAST OF BABYLON AGAINST THE SON OF HERCULES aka GOLIATH, KING OF THE SLAVES
Gordon Scott (Nipur), Genevieve Grad (Tamira), Andrea Scotti (Namar), Celina Celi (Agar), Moira Orfei (Ura), Mario Petri (Cyrus), Piero Lulli (Balthazar), Andrea Aurelli (Anarse), Giuseppe Addobbati (Licardio), Harold Bradley (Mursuk), Paola Petrini
Directed by Siro Marcellini
The Short Version: Action packed pseudo biblical era Sword & Sandal picture stars the great Gordon Scott in a rather exciting and intermittently brutal adventure. The usual peplum tropes are on hand, but with some surprising differences. Some character inconsistencies hamper things slightly, but the pace is so fast, the popcorn thrills help keep this breezy entertainment afloat.
""Why can't those miserable idiots just die quietly without disturbing our pleasure?!""--Balthazar trying to enjoy a feast with his company
Living among Persians and being educated under the service of Cyrus, king of Persia, Nipur returns to Babylon to take his rightful place on the throne. Upon his arrival, the evil Balthazar carries the scepter belonging to Nipur's father, the former ruler of Babylon, who has mysteriously disappeared. Fearing the tyrant, the surrounding villagers are enslaved and the young Jewish daughters regularly sacrificed to Ishtar, the goddess of fire. Nipur revolts against Balthazar's despicable deeds and attempts to halt the sacrifice of his friends fiance, Agar. He fails and is injured escaping the city. Returning to the camp of Cyrus, the Persian king and Nipur launch an attack to bring down the cruelty of Balthazar and restore the throne to its rightful heir.
Siro Marcellini isn't a name that crops up very often in the most familiar Italian genre movies, but his frequently grim entry in the Sword and Sandal sweepstakes is one of the most enjoyable and flamboyantly garish of the entire run of these ancient history adventure tales. Ancient Babylon has many legends tied to it and many of these translate well to mythological and biblical tales of heroism and villainy. This Italian-French co-production (shot on left over sets from THE FURY OF ACHILLES) is one of the best the genre has to offer, and while it has a mis-step or two from budgetary limitations, it's still a great deal of fun.
The camera pans back and you see this stuntman hit hard on the ground. This scene is a night time scene in the non restored export dubbed version.
The plot is similar to the one in another Gordon Scott vehicle, THE TYRANT OF LYDIA AGAINST THE SON OF HERCULES (1963), but that film highlights the court intrigue, while here, action is the order of the day. These action scenes are exciting and well staged. There's one incredible stunt seen early on that's just as impressive now as it must have been at the time. In it, Nipur's friend, Namar, is being chased by soldiers atop the roofs of the Babylonian city. With nowhere to go, Namar leaps from the top of one of the buildings down onto two of men waiting below. There's no airbag, no cushioning hidden beneath the dirt, nothing. It's an amazing daredevil stunt perfectly captured by the camera. Furthermore, in the English dubbed version, this scene is day-for-night, but in the restored print, it's a daytime sequence.
It's of the popular opinion that Steve Reeves is the king of the Sword & Sandal movies and while his popularity for propelling the genre to herculean heights is unquestionable, Gordon Scott (the most famous next to Reeves) should be the rightful heir to the cinematic Torch & Toga throne. He's easily the best actor of the bunch and was incredibly energetic in his action scenes. He was also adamant about doing his own stunts and throughout his career, Scott pulled off some extremely dangerous and life threatening examples of derring do. All of Scott's sword fights and brawls here are done by him and his hyperactive movements are undeniable. There's even a couple of occasions where Scott slows down to allow for one of the poor extras to keep up with his sword strikes. One impressive shot sees two automatons throw spears at Scott and he knocks them away with his blade. No stuntman, just Gordon Scott, a terribly underrated matinee action star.
Piero Lulli as Balthazar is one of the most sadistically evil characters that ever usurped a throne in a Torch & Toga movie. He orders the deaths of female Jewish slaves whether by fire or strangulation, has children captured, orders an envoy from Cyrus to have his hand chopped off and other unpleasantries. In an unusual touch that was rarely, if ever seen again, Balthazar takes a sword and challenges Nipur during the conclusion. In nearly all these movies, the tyrant king sends his minions to their deaths against the hero, or uses the lead damsel in distress as a shield, or bartering tool. Not this time as both protagonist and antagonist engage in a sword duel. Such a thing is very refreshing in a genre that infrequently deterred from 'by the numbers' genre conventions.
Moira Orfei sizzles as the evil and duplicitous Ura. Most peplums have a calculating female and she was one of the best at essaying a double dealing, scheming woman, or sorceress of some kind. Here, she learns of Nipur's true intentions of avenging his father's death as well as rescuing the fiance of his friend, Namar. She pledges that she wishes to join Nipur as Queen should he assassinate Balthazar. In reality, she cares for no man, just whoever can help her attain her aspirations. This, too, is different. In many other similar movies, the evil Queen, or villainess, falls for the hero and ends up dying at the end. The character of Ura, while showing a sexual desire for Nipur, is pure evil right to the end. Her cold utterance of ""The first one"", as she points out which frightened slave to throw to the fire is memorable.
The English version under the SONS OF HERCULES moniker differs slightly and eliminates any mention of Jews and also shortens the scenes of violence. The only other major difference is the added opening narration that links the film to the other re-edited 'Sons of Hercules' films that were popular in America once upon a time. Some of the dubbed dialog is outrageous especially the lines from Balthazar and his minions reveling in their cruelty in the most over the top fashion.
It's not all perfect in Babylon, though. Possibly the biggest plot hole is the failed rescue of Agar, Namar's future wife. Initially, Nipur requests her as his slave after she's chosen to be sacrificed. Balthazar agrees, but Ura knows Agar belongs to Nepir's friend, realizing he is merely saving her from death so that the two may be together. When Nepir refuses Ura's offer to rule together, Agar is chosen to be killed anyway. Nepir attempts to thwart the sacrifice, but is forced to run instead. Meanwhile, Namar, who is among the witnesses, is kept from saving his lover who ends up being thrown into the fire pit. After this terrible incident, Namar appears unaffected the rest of the movie and isn't in the film that much afterward.
Without the intense power of Gordon Scott, this wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable. With the added attraction of both Orfei and an evil relishing Lulli adorned in several flamboyant costumes, this is a no brainer for brawny movie lovers.

Acid dyes and stains could be used creating limitless arty designs.
Stamped concrete is nothing new, although for generations it has just been utilized from the most innovative and arty contractors who produced their own merchandise. In the last few years the need has exploded due to the remedies a lot of the newest products supply. The mix of artists, enterprisers, producers and contractors have worked collectively through learning from mistakes to enhance the merchandise, gear and use techniques. The technological progress of concrete overlays have enhanced with quicker program times and additional durability.

"Climate: The US boasts a wide variety of climate types due to its size and range of geographic features.
Time Zone: Six times zones — Alaska, Hawaii plus four on mainland — PST, MST, CST, EST
International phone code: 1
Currency: US Dollars
Capital: Washington, DC
Transportation: Most travellers find themselves entering the US at one of its major entry points, such as New York, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles, but many mid-size cities have international airports too. If you’re arriving by car, the US-Canada and US-Mexico borders are two of the most frequently crossed borders in the world, with millions of crossings daily. Greyhound buses offer inexpensive cross-border service from both Canada and Mexico throughout their network. Amtrak offers international train service from Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal into the US.
The size of the US and the distance separating its major cities make air the principal mode of travel for short-term travellers. Major carriers compete for business on major routes, and travellers willing to book two or more weeks in advance can get bargains. However, many smaller destinations are served by only one or two regional carriers, and prices there can be expensive. Domestic passenger trains can be surprisingly scarce and relatively expensive.
Renting or bringing your own car is usually a very good idea. This applies even to very large cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami, where public transport is limited and having a car is the most practical way of getting around. (The exceptions are New York City, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and Washington, DC, where having your own car is not only unnecessary, but discouraged.) In most medium-sized American cities, everything is very spread out and public transportation thin. Intercity bus travel is widespread, and while not available everywhere, there are at least three daily routes in every state.
Gay United Kingdom
Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights in the US have evolved over time, yet still vary, sometimes drastically, on a state-by-state basis. Currently nine states — Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont and Washington (as well as the capital district of Washington, DC) offer same-sex marriages. Rhode Island will recognize gay marriages performed out-of-state, but won’t offer them locally. California briefly legalized gay marriage then rescinded it, after a citizens’ ballot initiative (Proposition 8) rolled it back in 2008. Many states explicitly banned gay marriage.
Recent studies — some scientific, some subjective — have revealed a continuing migration of gay Americans into mainstream, middle-American life. The queer scene is no longer found in just the obvious gay Meccas like San Francisco and New York City. While still on the list of Gayest Cities in America, they're being joined by unlikely candidates such as Columbus, Austin and Iowa City.",<urn:uuid:49668d92-ac75-448a-b2a7-d24a18ad303c>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.dailyxtratravel.com/(X(1)S(5rob3jvc2ngbdlbtwwdmcqua))/united-states,2024-02-20T23:25:23Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9460219740867615,593,2.111079454421997,2
"I don't remember if I shared this yet, it is my colour team layout for the current Scrapbook Creations mag which just arrived on my door this morning. It's been out a couple of weeks, though. This photo is of baby Abby, my friends Kate and Dan's little girl when she was just new. The colour combo was violet and lemon. I finished the layout I needed to do for my current deadline, ideally I'd have liked to post them yesterday but since Monday night was spent as evacuees rather than scrapping as I'd hoped it would be, today will have to do. Should still get to Sydney by Friday, as required :)
I also uploaded the latest Q Tea Kit 'Monkey See Monkey Do' but when I started writing the contents I realised I'd gotten the picture quite wrong - it was missing at least three different items! So I'll be photographing it again later and replacing the current pic with a COMPLETE one. Wouldn't that be handy?
This pic is of the four kids at the assembly we had on the weekend, I barely took any but I like this :) Kind of vintage processed. Mostly used actions from here.
Ash is excited about his new toy - a barrel of monkeys. Isn't that retro or something? A nice simple toy that he is having fun with, and only $5. Yay for everyone :)
I wanna get one of these for baby 3, but which colour? Maybe just the chocolate brown? A green would be nice, but chocolate brown might be more versatile as far as which hat he could wear when I photograph him, like red or another brown. It's all about the photos, after all ;)
I love etsy, I have to say. Such a great vehicle for individual creative people to put their stuff out there. Isn't this cute and cheerful? I've custom ordered a baby hat from here - and she's just in New Zealand - awesome! This shop is based in Sydney and she has a dragonfly and rose necklace I adore, among other things to admire. This artist from France makes me want to sew on paper and get all whimsical. Virtual window shopping is fun!
Thanks for the messages of concern, phone calls, etc. I've never evacuated before but it was all pretty easy, packed a suitcase and some computer stuff, and we just went up the hill instead of down it to avoid the traffic. The CFA warning to leave early if you don't plan on defending is a pretty smart idea, if you can do it :) The kids were happy to have a sleepover at our friend's place!
There is a lot of CFA activity around, the firefighters are just amazing - a lot would have just responded yesterday and then not slept all night, as a lot of the big firefighting happened in the middle of the night. A lot of people around the streets having conversations with their neighbours, shopkeepers, etc, and I think a lot of people feeling the same gratitude that we are able to have that confidence - the CFA will do everything they can. Even though they are just people too. Pretty awesome.
Anyhow, I have a house to tidy and a layout to do today, best be off :)
There is heavy smoke and ember risk to an area of Upwey south of Burwood Highway (personally, we are north of Burwood Hwy), where Kell's house is, but the fire itself is further south, past Glenfern Rd. Kell and Roh and their kids, Reeze and Bodie are at Rohan's parents place, safe in suburban Bayswater. Ben and the kids and I went up the hill and are staying with some friends in Olinda tonight.
Long story short, we're all fine, and none of us have stuck around at home :)
I'm going to have to scrap scrap scrap when I get home, I have layouts that needed to be posted by Wednesday for a deadline, one of which I haven't started yet!
Hope everyone is well, stay safe.
The wooden series also goes well on the IKEA train tracks, which are nice and affordable :) So we mix the two sets. Anyhow, he's been having a great time, and goes to bed each night with his 'train track story'. Though it's sometimes hard to tell if he means 'train track' or 'train truck', as he says both, LOL. So far I had bought him the Thomas engine, and then have been getting family names, there is Toby (Ben's brother's name) the Tram Engine and Mike (Ben's dad), the red engine in the photo below. I am yet to pick up the Bill and Ben set to have a Ben engine as well, we are almost fitted out with Quarmby engines though, LOL. Just a random little snippet about Ash :)
I bought this necklace from etsy the other day, with the proceeds of the sale going to the Bushfire appeal. There are a bunch of sellers participating, check it out and see if anything takes your fancy :) You might also try changing the search to wildlife victoria to also find those sellers who have chosen that appeal to help the wildlife affected by the fires.
For my part, I re-listed this painting (which I love, but seems appropriate in theme for the bushfire appeal and is small enough to post), and it sold for US$90, which turned out to be AU$138 toward the appeal. I am really pleased that I was able to contribute more money than I can afford by selling art for the purpose. I still plan on having prints made of this piece, though, as well as some others. Another thing on my general to-do list :)
Back to the bushfire stuff, there are also collections for other items that will be distributed later in the year during re-building, such as books (yay - I have loads to spare in excellent condition, and love a good de-clutter, so will donate a few boxes of books), handmade items and household items.
As for the subject matter, I got an email from Spencer and Rutherford featuring their new Autumn/Winter collection, which is also their 10th anniversary collection. I adore this one - a style I loved for the past two collections, but in this fabric it's irresistible (in a totally resistable kind of way, I am not about to spend over $400 on a bag). Inspiring, though. I want to sew some stuff.
Actually I should go to Spotlight today, I need some cotton backing so I can make the cushions and window seat cover with my lovely new fabrics. I also need some supplies for this workshop I am doing - quite excited about some of the items on the class list :) I feel like making some things, still scrapbooking, but also getting a bit crafty.
Speaking of scrapbooking and craft, the sneak peek for Q Tea's March kit is up - Monkey See Monkey Do.
OK back to the ultrasound, Sienna was cheering for a girl as we went in, and told Tammy (the technician who did the ultrasound) that she wanted it to be a girl. She said it so many times, that I felt quite sorry for her by the very end of the ultrasound when we found out we are having another boy. She was NOT HAPPY. Got in quite a little mood, I had to physically carry her out of the radiology clinic, as she was folding her arms and settling in for a protest of some kind. When I spoke to her and explained that even though it might be disappointing because she had wanted a girl, it is ok to feel upset, but it's not something we could help and a boy baby will still be fun for her. She told me ""I'm not upset, I'm angry!"" which I have to admit I found very funny! She's quite a passionate little thing, and very stubborn.
Later on she tells me she has decided that she doesn't like 3 anymore, that she likes 4 (as in, number of kids) and that the next one can be a girl. I was like 'uh, no' and told her again that you can't pick what babies are going to be! Later, after school, she was in a bit better spirits and seemed to be getting used to the boy idea. So I told her we are trying to pick a name and told her our two top choices, asked what she liked. She picked one, which is unfortunately not the same as Ben's favourite, and now seems to think that she should get to decide. So the new challenge is explaining the difference between asking for an opinion and a decision :)
These pics (above) are from Sienna's second day of school, when I apparently had to photograph her alternative summer uniform - shorts and top. Ash wanted to get in on the action as well ;)
Sienna's wall decals arrived, and have been put on the wall, a little bit by the door (above) and most of them between her toys and table. She thinks they are beautiful, so that's the job done I guess, LOL. She still needs a new painting or some other sort of wall decoration.
My last piece of fabric arrived the other day and I have decided it will make cushions for the couch - piccy above of the fabric draped on our vintage red velvet lounge suite.
A whole collection of initiatives and appeals have begun to contribute to the Victoria Bushfire Appeal, and with over 20 bushfires still out of control across the state we can only hope the threat will dissipate soon. The Dandenongs are still out of the danger zone.
The blog Meet Me At Mikes has a fantastic list in the middle bar of the blog with a variety of ways to help with the appeal. Some that I plan on supporting are:
- Shopping at Coles and Safeway on the days each company will be setting aside their profits for the Bushfire Appeal - for Coles it is this Friday, for Safeway the following Friday.
- On etsy there is a new seller specifically selling for the bushfire appeal, as well as a whole bunch of individual sellers adding items to benefit the appeal - simple search for bushfire and they will come up. I bought a necklace this morning with the benefits going to the appeal, it is a great way for people who have more skills than money (such as myself) to make a contribution. I'll be adding some artwork to benefit the appeal later this week.
- This auction for scrapbooking items on ebay is also for the appeal.
I just went to see what Ash was doing, and found him like this, sleeping cosily in my bed! I just hope he doesn't wet it... hmm... it's pretty cute though. He had such a weird sleep, bedtime was 4:50pm on the way to get Ben from work, and that was it! So he also woke very early and is obviously catching up now. It is very rare for him to nap during the day, so this is good :)
It's kind of more official now, you can actually tell that I'm pregnant (as opposed to just podgy I guess, LOL) and the kids got to hear baby's heart beat yesterday afternoon at the midwife appointment. It took her ages to find the heart beat, which was at least partly because the kids were hovering around me watching her and kept making me laugh. Especially Ash, who was saying ""babies? oh no!"" and looking concerned at me, among other helpful comments from both him and Sienna. Anyhow, all is fine. Our 20 week ultrasound is on Friday.
One last pic of my funny kidlets, just to lighten the mood a little on this cold Summer day :)
I know some people have been checking with us, being unsure where we live in relation to the disasters, so wanted to update with our location. Here is a Google map with locations of the fires and where they have been. You can click through and zoom in or out, read town names (we are between Ferny Creek and Belgrave). The other large fire, in Gippsland, is about an hour south-east of us.
View Larger Map
Mostly on Saturday, some towns have basically been destroyed by the fires and the death toll currently stands at 130 confirmed. I believe the most threatening fire at present is near Beechworth, let's hope this cooler weather means the firefighters can make progress. A bunch of bushfire relief appeals have begun to help the people and towns who have lost their homes and loved ones in the disaster - here is a link to one of them.
These pictures are from last Summer, when Sienna and I met my friend Rosie at St Andrews markets. St Andrews is one of the towns that is virtually destroyed now.
We're lucky here.
On Monday she unfortunately caught sight of me waiting for her on her way back to the class from lunch break, and took off across the school in the opposite direction. Eventually a year 6 boy helped me get her down from the big kids' playground on the other side of the school from the prep classroom! Yesterday I hung back so she couldn't see me, but then she was escorted back to her class by the school principal - everyone seems to be getting to know her pretty quickly at least (I'm glad it's a small school! Less than 100 kids altogether).
Here she is getting stuck in as soon as we arrived in the classroom on Monday. Ash is more bothered by the adjustment to school than Sienna is, getting quite grumpy with me for leaving her at school! On the first day I took him for a baby cino after drop-off and took a pic of him in the cafe.
Did some scrapping at Kell's today while Sienna was at school, I have a deadline in a couple of weeks. 3 layouts down (well, the 3rd is *almost* finished) and 3 to go, all for Scrapbook Creations issue 67. I have the colour team and a feature article. So, nothing new to share at the moment.
Most of my fabrics arrived the other day to cover the window seat and make cushions, I am just waiting on the last cushion fabric and then I will head to a fabric shop to pick up matching cotton fabric to use on the backs of the cushions and window seat. In the meantime, I've ordered these Wall Candy wall decals for Sienna's room (even though hers is the only bedroom NOT getting re-decorated, I really wanted to add something new to the walls) and am waiting for them to arrive.
This other Wall Candy product - a rococo chalkboard frame (below) - is SO tempting me at the moment. I can really see it on my yellow kitchen wall... but can't justify it at the moment, so will just keep the pic in my inspiration folder ;)
My cousin Bec and her hubby Joel are staying with us for a couple of nights this weekend, am looking forward to some hanging out time with them! And Sienna is supposed to be getting her new goldfish at last, she had to wait longer than expected due to the heat, so she will still have someone to 'share' her bedroom with. Have a great week, keep cool :)",<urn:uuid:e10133b4-e3de-49eb-8157-7117ddf3e152>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.danielleq.com/2009/02/,2024-02-20T21:39:23Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9847854375839233,3158,0.6496250629425049,1
"Read a story in the Ottawa Citizen today about U of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management MBA students taking an oath of conduct. The article is here. Another article from the CBC with a copy of the oath is here.
To recap the story, the students at Telfer have joined two North American schools to take an oath of conduct upon graduation. The other schools are Harvard and Thunderbird (Arizona). The oath itself contains statements about considering all stakeholders (not just shareholders) in decisions, obeying laws and acting in an environmentally sustainable manner, among other things.
Having recently completed an MBA, I think it is also important to point out the effect many of the recent ""scandals"" have had on MBA programs. In one word, it would be HUGE.
I did my MBA at UBC (Robert H. Lee graduate school at Sauder) and in the program there, Ethics or Corporate Social Responsibility was one of the main cornerstones of our program. The first three months of the program is referred to a ""The Core"". Everyone does the same 13 subjects and few of them get more attention than others in that you spend more time studying them and case discussions are centered around them. They included accounting, marketing, supply chain, strategy and corporate social responsibility. Our year started out with a discussion of Joel Bakan's ""The Corporation"" and our major project, a business plan, had to included considerations for corporate social responsibility. I have not attended other MBA programs, but I can only assume there was a similar emphasis in other programs.
Why does this oath exist and why are MBA graduates taking it?
1) MBA are starting to get a bad reputation. Many people believe that MBA's are at fault for many recent financial scandals. Jeff Skilling from Enron was a Harvard MBA.
2) Other professionals such as Accountants and Doctors have to take oaths of conduct.
What do I think about it?
It is a marketing ploy. The oath is not mandatory and it is not universal across all MBA programs so for the time being, it serves to differentiate one student or one program from another. Any MBA program worth anything SHOULD be teaching a heavy dose of corporate social responsibility so an oath such as this should not be necessary.
It is not going to deter bad behavior. Some people might argue that if something stops just one person, it is successful. I believe that is an excuse for an inefficient allocation of time and resources. Perhaps more time and effort should be spent inside the program teaching corporate social responsibility, instead of tacking on an oath at the end. And even then, I am sure we are always going to have these problem because not everyone that commits fraud/white collar crime is an MBA and because human nature often trumps everything else.
Personally, I found it really funny that the entire time we were debating and discussing the Enron scandal in my MBA program, Wall Street was pulling billions of dollars out of Main Street. I believe that until regulators and government get seriously tough on corporate crime, we are going to have these problems. Energy goes to where the money is. Which means that if you're smart you will go to Wall Street and make millions instead of going to SEC and making nothing. As long as Wall Street is smarter than Main Street at ripping people off, the trend will continue and oaths like the one taken at Ottawa U, Harvard and Thunderbird sound nice... but if we think they are going to make a difference, we are only kidding ourselves.

I could be wrong, but I believe that many stores are currently under-staffed because they are trying to reduce overhead in the face current market conditions. From a business perspective, I can understand the logic... if sales are flat or declining, then you need to reduce your costs to maintain or increase profitability.
But this leaves a bad taste in the mouth of your customers. And it does this at a crucial time. As a consumer, I have two broad choices to make each day: do I spend my money or not. And I believe that in times like these, that question becomes all the more important. In the good times, consumers think about where they are going to spend their money but in recessions, people think about if they are going to spend their money much harder in a recession than when times are good.
So if a consumer has decided they are going to spend their money, which is probably a decision people are not making very often, should a firm just throw the opportunity for that purchase (to fill that demand) out the window with poor service? I think not.
This leads me into viewing a recession as an opportunity. I think that smart firms understand this and see this opportunity to grab market share from the competition. For this reason, I say that a recession is an opportunity.
I think the same applies to career planning. If you are successful in your career and times are good, then the opportunity cost of switching careers is high because then you will forgo all the progress you could have made if switch career paths. When you're in a recession, that opportunity cost is much lower, so if you're going to make the switch - now is the time.
The job market is not very good right now - trust me - but there are opportunities and I read last week that we may never, at least for a while, go back to the levels of employment we were at a few years ago. I read this to mean that some people may never get back into their old industries. Worse, some people may never even get back in the job market or have a really hard time doing so.
So I say that if you're going to make a move - now is the time. It is all about perspective and I think everything changes if you look at a recession like an opportunity.

Over time, it seemed as though it became harder and harder to catch the big ones; yet one specific type of fish, the Muskellunge or ""musky"", was always what we were after. Muskies are the largest members of the pike family and I have caught a few pike in my day.
However I had never caught a musky. Until last Thursday.
My brother in law and I had been talking about trying to get out musky fishing for a long time. We spoke to local fisherman who had caught muskies and figured out a few places where they were active. It should be noted that the Ottawa River is known for some of the best musky fishing in the world.
Finally, one of his close friends purchased a proper fishing boat and we were one step closer. Then, we found out about a place known for an abundance of large muskies and everything fell into place.
I went out and got licenses, a few large lures and some heavier fishing line. We loaded up the boat with some food and we were off to the races. Musky tend to feed in the morning or at night so we went out later in the afternoon for the late shift.
We launched our boat and started trolling at about 5mph. With four lines in the water, we got tangled up a few times but once that was all sorted out the real action began.
I started reeling in my line because I thought I might be tangled or have a bunch of weeds but it turned that as soon as my line came closer to the boat, something was on it. My first musky! It was about 36 inches long and about 10 pounds:
I caught a second one about an hour and half later that was about the same size but it spit the hook as we were about to put it in the net.

Vankleek Hill is about an hour east of Ottawa, towards Montreal. Beau's is a small brewery in Vankleek Hill that makes some of the best craft beers I have ever tasted. They make a beer called Lug Tread that is considered a lagered ale in that it combines the best of both types of beer. It is available at select LCBO stores in ceramic bottles and select pubs as well as restaurants. Look for it and give it a try sometime.
This was the first time there had been an Octoberfest celebration at the fairgrounds in Vankleek Hill and it was an interesting time to say the least.
There were lots of things to see and do. There was a traditional ompah band, hay rides, a pretty zoo for the kids, food, lots of beer and ""Norm"" from Cheers was there.
I felt the event was highly over-priced. It was $15 to get in, which I think was pretty steep seeing as you can go to rural fairs and pay $10 for all the rides. Mugs were $8 and then it was $4 a beer and $1 for food tickets and various food items were pretty costly... up to like $7 for a sandwich. Kids admission was free though.
The service for beer was pretty laughable. It took me TWO hours to get my first beer. I had to wait 45 minutes for beer tickets then over 1.5 hours to get a beer. And the people service didn't really seem organized.
Show up early. We got there at 3:30 and bus after bus of people were arriving. Just after I got my first beer at 5:30, the beer lines seemed to be much better. Be warned about going late.. they claimed to be sold out at about 6pm when we were leaving but the event was going until 9pm.
Here are some pictures

For one thing, my header (I often call it masthead) image reflect my previous geographic location on the west coast. For those of you who didn't know, that was a picture of the Burrard Inlet and Georgia Straight taken from the Stanley Park seawall.
My new image is a picture I took a few years ago on the canal locks next to the Chateau Laurier. In the coming weeks, I am going to do my best to get out on my bike and get a better picture that I think summarizes Ottawa better, but this will have to do for now.
I also simplified the color palate and design elements to make things look a little bit cleaner and re-organized my right hand column to reflect the changing times... which means I moved my tweets up and the RSS feed down.
Good call? Bad call? Let me know what you think.

So here is my last update that details how things got resolved. To recap, getting my ROE (record of employment) was a nightmare and didn't happen until mid August (finished work at the end of June). I finally got everything sorted and submitted close to the end of August (24th) to be exact and was supposed to get a decision on September 16th.
What ended up happening was that there was no decision made on September 16th. In fact, it took them nearly a week to finally make a decision and in order to that, they needed to clarify some stuff with former employer. I found this out because I was calling the EI office every single day.
The EI office calls my company in the USA but leaves a number only available in Canada... so my old company can't call back... I had to play middle-man and get the EI rep's number from my old company, call them and leave a message that to call back and if a message is left, use a number that works.
Turns out that all happened and they finally approved my application and I got the funds 2 days later.
So let me summarize my lessons to anyone in a similar situation:
1) If you know you are going to leaving work before it happens, ask for your ROE as soon as you can so that you can leave the office with it on your last day OR have it processed ASAP after you leave. Ideally, you get a paper copy and walk out with it on your last day. If not, be sure to ask for it before you leave and have them process it and send it to you. It can be submitted electronically but have them only do that if they know how to do it. Otherwise you are best going and handing it in.
2) Fill out your EI application immediately when you finish work. You can do it online or you can do it in person. Personally, I had an account with Services Canada because of my e-Taxes that made doing it online really easy.
3) Continually monitor the status of your application. That said, it does take about three weeks for things to be processed.
4) Be prepared to wait for everything to happen. For example, when I dropped off my ROE it took about 5 business days for it to show that it arrived. When they were suppose to call me, it took two business days to get processed.
5) Don't expect to be getting a large sum of money. At best you are looking at 450 dollars a week so be sure to have some savings to fall back on.
6) The good news is that you can be eligible for a good number of weeks of coverage... so rest assured that you will be given some time to find a new job.

"Stove Bread Sky: Acoustic set/October 16, 2013
Stephen was in top form and I noticed that his acoustic was plugged into a few pedals besides a BOSS stompbox tuner. Right after ""Beautiful Breakup"" he loops a few riffs with I think a Digitech Jamman (single stompbox) pedal. The 2 other pedals he used were covered in black duct tape but I knew one was a delay and the other a pitch/shifter delay pedal (PS-3). The PS-3 pedal was subtle and would underly all the songs in this set. You could probably hear it better on headphones or loudly thru speakers.
It was a nice selection of songs played to a small audience, but was definitely worth being there to captured the experience. I also purchased his newest solo work entitled, ""Hit Or Mystery."" The next link is to my youtube account of the entire set captured on my Sony Bloggie video camera.

"Abrasos, Joy Fox | Asian Moment Head, Joy Fox |
There will always be a feeling of coming home when I go to the ranch. Perhaps it is Joy Fox’s welcoming spirit; her warmth or it might also be the way she offers her art to others. I met Joy Fox through her late husband Bruce McGrew and she has always treated me as if we have grown old together many times.
Other than the development of new homes across from Rancho Linda Vista the ranch looks the same as it did 40 years ago when I first visited. Joy Fox’s large totem sculptures rise out of the landscape and greet, they are composed of clay and stand as part animal, part human, muse or goddess, representations of spirit in nature. Pictures, words, and pieces of poetry etch the surfaces on many of the forms and they project an ancient and primitive wisdom.
I have owned one of Fox’s totem sculptures for 10 years now and I can see on the folds and wings the hint of conversation between her and the others, the shapes mimic many of the negative shapes in Bruce McGrew’s paintings and seem to drift between dream world and waking realities in their representation. She uses many kinds of clay from many locations, each offering their unique character to the fire and although clay is the oldest medium man has used to express form I am still in awe that taking earth and adding water and fire can produce so much of what we need, even today.
Joy Fox’s studio door was open when I first arrived, as it was each time I returned. She is an open person, very loving and accepting as if all the years of kneading and folding the clay have made her flexible and finely adaptive. The studio was filled with her large and small figures watching her as guardians. In every piece, she reminds us of our earliest human art works, each a continuum of her lifelong conversation with the goddess. She carries the wisdom of the ages and the ancients; every piece holds sacredness even the stray parts of unconstructed totems held the presence of devotion. Joy Fox morphs with life and the work as clay cures. Broken pieces of her sculptures among the flowers and stones tell me she knows the clay will return to the earth eventually, back to the goddess as will she.
The dialogue with Joy Fox.
Diane: I just wondered if art has been at all therapeutic. Have you experienced art as a therapeutic agent?
Joy Fox: Well I think I have. I mean, especially when Bruce died. I mean, if I didn't have my work, I think I would have really been at a loss. That's when I got into yoga much heavier, much more, and you know just working through that, that difficult time.
Diane: Did you find it hard to work after he died?
Joy Fox: Well fortunately we had a group show lined up, I mean the two of us at the Davis Dominguez Gallery. I had tons of work of Bruce's that we put up. I decided I just wanted to go ahead and do that even so soon after his death. I think it was a lifesaver in a lot of ways because, what are you going to do?
Bruce was just wonderful through the whole thing [his dying process]. He just took it so well, it was really awesome. He was very sharp. I think if it wasn't for the work, and because that was so much a part of our life together it got us both through. It was just our main connection. And the yoga, it just helped a lot, helped me get through a lot of that. But the art we shared was the blessing.
Diane: I see so many similarities in your work and his; you really can see your connection. Just the way the images speak to each other. I have that big sculpture of yours. You put scratched images into the clay. I see that the images link to your life with Bruce. I see a sun, there's a sun in one of the sides. It was your piece, “La Mariposa”.
Joy Fox: I remember the piece, yeah.
Diane: I love that sculpture so much. I see the way there was this conversation between your images and his that is very interesting, and very unique.
Joy Fox: Well there were a lot of things that I really learned from him. I wrote a couple of the things down . . .first of all we did a lot of travel, a lot of art pilgrimages. He was always working. He was either painting or teaching, even when we traveled. And his discipline was so incredible. I learned a lot about that, and dedication, from him. We really liked each other's work. We always had conversations going on. We'd visit each other's studios almost every day after we worked and things. I was always saying, ""Oh do you like it better this way or do you like this way or should I try this?"" You know with sculpture, you can just pick things up in pieces and assemble them. And I’d say, ""Do you like this better than this or should this go with this space."" And he’d say, ""Well ask the artist."" He would always end up saying, ""Well ask the artist.” And so since he died I would just start having conversation with myself. I started that a long time ago, and now, I mean there's really no one to ask. But there's really not anybody I have in my life who is like Bruce when he would come in, and we'd talk about work.
Diane: I see you include the muse in a lot of your pieces. Those conversations you refer to, is that where the muse comes in?
Joy Fox: I think so. That was something that was real important to him. He did a whole series about the muse. He was always using that as a subject. And I did too. I did a whole series of pieces of the Greek muses.
Who knows where that all comes from, but it comes from our conversations. It's just funny though that moment of knowing when your work is finished; I would just completely overwork things. Like I said, it was harder in the past to have a clear sense of when it was finished. But it got to a point where I have had to have an inner conversation going on. I'm sure I even talk to myself. With these, these were all figures pretty much, so they ended up having a conversation amongst themselves. They do take on a life on their own. For me, when I'm putting a piece together I pick up one part and try . . .this piece for instance, I'm just building it right now but it's going to be an animal kind of figure that's going to have about three different figures. A figure on top of a figure, on an animal. A figure on the top of an animal is sort of the idea. So I thought about three or four different figures, and I don't know which one I'll use until after they're fired. Because sometimes once it's fired, it takes on another life that is very different, it comes alive. It looks pretty dead right now. But then once it's fired different changes happen.
Diane: Oh that's beautiful.
Joy Fox: And that's from the fire. You know that's not from anything I did. I mean, I painted the figure, it’s got a top to it, and head.
Diane: That's interesting though that the fire plays a part in the actual creating.
Joy Fox: Yes, that's the magic.
Diane: You could be finished, but the fire really helps
Joy Fox: It's so different. Look how different they look.
Diane: So this will turn into a different color?
Joy Fox: Well this has some blue on it, this has some color. This doesn't, this has red iron, and the clay is white. It's the same thing this clay is a reddish clay, and this clay is a white clay. So that makes a little difference too. But the iron in the clay that gives it the red. Then the smoke will affect it, and the heat, the fire even gives it kind of a halo. So that's magic. That's like magic entering into the whole. Bruce always talked about magic too. He believed it came from the people that are, the continuum.
Diane: The ancestors I guess. And this looks old as if its been worn and weathered.
Joy Fox: Right. Well I love it when this kind of thing happens when you get these sorts of flashes from the fire.
Diane: As if it’s set, it’s been thrown into the fire after being used.
Joy Fox: And it’s because of its relationship to the other pieces. That happens too because I sometimes use different methods of firing like putting a little burnable piece of something, actually art news magazines are great because they have that shiny ink surface. And if you take a little bit of it, put it in between and you stack them like that, and put something in between here that smokes, that burns out you get different tones, darkened areas on the surface.
Diane: That's how you got that burnt mark on the surface?
Joy Fox: Well that could be, yeah, there was probably something there. But it's always a surprise; you never really know how it's going to come out. That's the magic in the part of it that I really love.
Diane: Now, that one is not fired.
Joy Fox: This is fired once. It’s reddish clay, I built this piece, and then it's going to be up on wheels, I’m using a lot of metal now. I put this pinkish under glaze on it, and then I carved through into the red clay. And now I'm going to fire it again, and put a little clear glaze over it, so that, these marks will come through and then the clear glaze will be shiny, shinier, darker too.
Diane: And then you take the tape off?
Joy Fox: I'll take it off before I fire it. I usually take it off right after I put clear glaze on.
Diane: I guess you want to pull the tape off to get the negative shapes?
Joy Fox: You don't have to, it will burn out. But sometimes the glaze sticks to the tape.
Diane: Well I want you to think about when you're getting ready to begin a piece. You know that moment, almost that moment before conception I guess it is.
Joy Fox: One of the things is, that I usually have more than one piece going on. I was thinking about that because for instance, if you're in a painting studio and you have the wall. I have a friend who's studio is absolutely clear of everything except for a chair, a podium where he has his dictionary, and a piece of black canvas on the wall. He doesn't have any paintings stored in there or anything. That's his studio. That's totally different from mine. I have all these things that give me ideas. For instance, I'm using a lot of metal now. And then I have things that I've started that I haven't finished. So you know when I come in here, there's so much already going on. It's not like I come into an empty place.
Diane: So the art kind of begins from art? It begets more art.
Joy Fox: Yeah, exactly. There are times if I'm working a piece, reworking it, and reworking it, and it's just not making any sense, I have to set it aside. I’ll start on something else, then look over at it and it will tell me what it needs, “Oh yeah, that's what I need to do to that piece.” And I might be working on something totally different, but suddenly know how to finish it.
Diane: Do you ever make a piece, such as a shape like that one, and not really know how you'll ever use it, but it just looks like such an interesting thing?
Joy Fox: Well that's why I have this one. This was going to be another figure. It's going to have kind of a little dress. I'll be working on a piece later, and I'll say, ""Oh that figure, that's what this needed."" So it's, it is a sort of conversation going on all the time between the pieces.
Diane: There seems to be a timelessness where they're all happening simultaneously like all the work, and pieces are of future works being done now, but they're intended for work next year perhaps. Works that you've taken apart, and reworked. But it's always this ongoing conversation between all of the work that you’ve done from the very beginning of your career on into the future. Even those finished works over there.
Joy Fox: Now those, once I feel they are finished, I want them out of my life or I don't want to work on them anymore. I very seldom go back, and change those.
Diane: They are like beings. They have a presence in the room.
Joy Fox: Yeah, I have finished work over here, and over there it's all pieces and bits.
It's like that conversation going on.
Diane: That's exactly what happens within the painting itself after you kind of lay down the environment with paint, it's like you create a visual culture. But in your case, it has to do with all of these shapes, and the clay, and how the clay is going to contribute to the conversation, how it's going to end up the color that it comes out of the fire.
Joy Fox: And I never know how the color's going to happen. Sometimes it's very boring, and I'm not too happy with it, and I'll re-fire it a couple of times before I get where I like it. Each piece, I want ideally to make sense. I mean, I want it to go together even though it's made out of a lot of pieces. That is kind of complicated. A lot of times, it goes together differently than what I planned. But then as I take each piece and work on it, for instance this piece here that I drew on. When I'm working each small part, I really like it as an individual work of art. You know I like the idea of handling it, and working on it, and carving into it. I'll probably, after this is fired add more glaze.
Diane: So your words that you add, I see lots of words.
Joy Fox: I've been doing that more and more, and more. Poetry and just things that come to mind.
Diane: Are they thoughts that sort of surface in the moment?
Joy Fox: Most of them. For the most part, it's just things that come up or it's bits out of conversations.
Diane: Like this, ""Crybaby cry, no baby, no cry.""
Joy Fox: Yeah, that's from a song.
Diane: I love it.
Joy Fox: “Sing, sing, sing. Why it makes me laugh out loud.” Bruce was so good with the brush, you know with the watercolor brush, and the calligraphy of the brush, and all that. That affected me a lot. I like carving, and making the marks. It's very important to me. These words, these things that have turned into words, they started as patterns maybe, and then function as calligraphy and hieroglyphics.
Diane: They just come out of you intuitively.
Joy Fox: Sometimes it does, sometimes it's not worthy at all. It depends if it's flowing. Sometimes it's not flowing at all. You probably feel the same way in painting because you think, ""Oh my God, what is wrong with this day or what's going on?""
Diane: Yes . . .sometimes you'll be painting, and you won't even know where your ideas and gestures comes from, and you'll suddenly find them in the painting. You need a certain color or another shape or you suddenly need to paint a bug in it or extra things. And you don't really know where it all came from, but it seems essential to the work. When I wanted to interview you, part the reason was because your work just feels so intuitive.
Joy Fox: You know the really ultimate place to be is when your mind is empty. That's what all the yoga, and meditation is all about it's just like emptying your mind. That’s what happens I think eventually once you get your mojo going. I love all these terms from songs and things because they're always descriptive. Descriptive, and simplified or something. That's what happens, you get your mojo working, and something happens, something clicks.
Diane: Have you ever lost track of time?
Joy Fox: Oh yeah. Lots of times.
Diane: It is something we've been trained into I guess. Have you had areas in any of these pieces where you felt like there was a big struggle or a struggle with either the elements or the medium or just. . .
Joy Fox: Well for sure. Things sometimes just don't go too well. I just usually work through it. Sometimes I have to leave it alone, go to something else. Sometimes I have to go sit in my chair, and look at images or I do a lot of visualization. Sometimes I just go over there, sit there, and look out the window, and think. I guess you'd call it visualizing.
If I can't, then I do drawings too, I have a book that I do a lot of little drawings of things. Ordinary things don't come out exactly like those drawings they go through big changes. And but it gives me a starting point, with the drawings. But you know the struggle, there's always a struggle. I think I've maybe learned how to go onto something else, not get too stuck. Like knowing when something's finished, you say, ""I don't like this, I don't like this, I don't like this."" And then all of a sudden maybe you just leave it alone, come back to it, and you know what to do.
Diane: So have you had periods in your life where you've felt like it was hard to come back to the studio?
Joy Fox: After a show it's always a little hard after everything is cleared out. I come out, and everything's gone and that can be difficult. A lot of times that's when maybe I'd take a trip or something.
Diane: To get re-inspired?
Joy Fox: Yeah, to get recharged. That’s one of the main reasons I travel is to get to look at art, look at nature. I do a lot of birding, I love plants, and so it's not too hard out here either because you just take a hike, and you just never get bored. There's always some surprise that's just around the corner.
Diane: You're such a positive person. I don't imagine you've ever really thought seriously about giving this up.
Joy Fox: Well I don't know. After the last show I had I didn't do anything for a couple of months. I just left it. I think, you know I'm getting towards the end of my life, and there are a lot of things I want to do that maybe aren't clay. Clay is so basic I want to get back into drawing more. I used to draw a lot more than I do now. I can't even seem to take the time out to do that. I don't know, there's just too much to do. I have way too much stuff going on in my life. I'm just surrounded by inspiration, kids art, children's art.
Diane: Yes, you draw a lot from children's art.
Joy Fox: I do. I always have. And now the kids are all getting older. And well Cezanne will someday have kids. There’s so much stuff I want to do. I want to go through all of Bruce's work, and get it more organized I have it all photographed and numbered and all that.
Diane: I don't work in clay but I feel a pull from it, and I wonder when you dream, do you dream in clay?
Joy Fox: No, but I do a lot of visualizing like say before I go to sleep, I think about figures or pieces or something I want to do. And sometimes when I wake up, I lay there and think about it. Bruce used to have these wild dreams. I mean, I'll have a wild dream once in a while, but his would always be visual.
Diane: Well these shapes that you have that come to you during waking consciousness are so dream-like. When you're mediating, they just seem to come through to you whenever you're in the zone.
Joy Fox: And like I say, I do a lot of visualization and looking, just looking at animal forms, and human forms, and plant forms.
Diane: There's a lot about the relationship between animals and humans in your work.
Joy Fox: Yeah. Well I love working with the human figure. I love doing different heads, you know different head studies.
Diane: Once you get a piece resolved, and you've got it suddenly together, and it works, can you describe what that feels like?
Joy Fox: You know it's a good feeling even though those feelings are sort of fleeting. But that gives you impetus to go onto something else. I work pretty rapidly and I don't stew over too much.
Diane: So as soon as something's done, you're done.
Joy Fox: I'm ready to go on to something else. I'm ready to go try other things, and I always want to experiment with different clays. I do a lot of experimentation with just the clays I dig around here, and mixing clays together, and just trying different combinations.
I've been working with paper clay, and then high fire clay, low fire clay; just all different kinds of glazed piece, some different kinds of glazes. Most of the glazes I just purchase, I don't really mix glazes too much. I just see a color I like, so I buy it and use it. But I don't use a lot of glaze, most of these colors are under glazes.
Diane: What is paper clay?
Joy Fox: That's this. This is this white clay and it's got paper in it. I just got a bunch of it recently. Most people don't want to mess with reconstituting it. You have to soak it, and mix it, and then wedge it back out. So what I end up doing is buying maybe a ton of a particular kind of clay. My favorite clay, one that's so great for the figures is a beige, kind of a beige-y clay, and it's groggy, it's real sculptural. It doesn't crack, and dry, and it's a really solid and easy to work with. So I buy that, and then you start with a scrap. I mix some together and they all work differently. Some of them are real fine. So I might want to do something with white fine clay where I want to do something small like a figure of something. This paper clay has got a lot of paper in it, and then it burns out, so it's lighter, and it's real easy to work with. You can just stick it together. You don't have to really work it together much. I've liked it; I've liked the feeling of it.
Diane: You were talking about reconstituting, and all this hard work. But I remember one time you were telling me that you enjoyed working with the clay because it made your back feel good. And all I could think of was that there was something of your energy that you put into the clay that was being released into the clay.
Joy Fox: That was true even when I first started at UCLA and I took my first clay experience, and even while I worked on little things as a kid. Do you see the coffee tea set over there? I was twelve I think when I did those.
Diane: Are they that old really?
Joy Fox: Yeah. Honest. Those little pitchers were the first things I threw on the wheel.
Diane: Oh how fascinating.
Joy Fox: My mother had all those. That's why I have those now; I got them back from her. I'm kind of glad that I'd given her so many things because I now have, things from every period of my life.
Diane: I think it's wonderful that you have your beginnings here with you. And then you have the ongoing and the future.
Joy Fox: It's all right here. These are from when I was studying with Paul Soldner. Some of the early pieces, there are four pots up there. And then my work became less functional, started getting more sculptural. I think it changed when I was in Mexico and started doing little figures. I have a couple of those left, but there's one up there, little figures where I was firing with cow manure down in Mexico.
But about my back . . .so I started working on the wheel, I had polio when I was young and my back always bothered me. They had me do some traction to help me with the curvature, and so I started working on the wheel at that same time. And I mean, the pain went away, it just went away. I never had any more problems until I got old now. I have a little bit of arthritis, but the yoga's really been helping. I don't have to take anything for it.
I haven't been working on the wheel much. I'm going to do some more because I like doing functional stuff once in a while. I like working on the light stoneware with the painting on the plates. I've got a whole bunch at the house. I can show you painting figures on white plates, and dishes, and I'm kind of out of all those. I usually do a couple of loads, and then I give them away for gifts, and use them myself. And now I'm out of all of them. So I’ve got to get back on the wheel now, and see how it affects my back.
Diane: I have one more question because I know I'm going to tire you out.
Joy Fox: Oh no, that's all right.
Diane: And you sort of did answer it when you were talking about how you would be working, and then you'd glance and another piece that would kind of catch your attention, and want your attention. But I really want to know if you've ever felt that you were responding to the voice of another. And some people call it spirit while they're in the work, and some will call it Providence, and some call it their higher selves. But is there, was there ever an awareness that you know, you really aren't alone in this work?
Joy Fox: Oh very much so. Especially I have these conversations with Bruce all the time. You know just sort of, I mean they're real.
Diane: They're real.
Joy Fox: Because I always think, ""Well what would he say about this or that?"" because he was always really good at verbalizing. I mean it's funny because he was good at verbalizing but he wasn't good at writing something down, and then presenting it, that kind of thing. He was just good at communicating between people one on one.
Diane: Yes, I do remember.
Joy Fox: And so definitely I feel that, and I feel that there is a conversation kind of within an inner conversation a lot. And so I don't know how to exactly describe it, and then I think the pieces speak. It's a way of saying. I think it's part of a continuum. This is the oldest art form in the planet.
Diane: That's right.
Joy Fox: I mean, you know they're still digging up the earliest pieces. They discovered how to fire clay pretty early on. It’s just very ancient and I feel a real connection to the others. Here's Nampeyo, she was always a heroine of mine, a Hopi potter. She died in 1942, this picture is from 1901. So that’s, her, she still has people in her ancestors making pots. Great granddaughters, and daughters, and these different periods. I think just even being there, and being with that art, and what those people were doing and saying. I think that comes through.
Diane: I do too.
Joy Fox: I don't know if you would call it a continuum. It's like a conversation going on since the millennium.
Diane: Like almost a channeling.
Joy Fox: Yeah.
Diane: Bruce Elwin McGrew.
Joy Fox: Yes, I made this. I never finished it and I’ve got to. Every once in a while, I think I'm going to do it. This is a poem. It was supposed to be a water figure. And this poem, this was right after he died W. S. Merwin wrote for his memorial. It says, ""You left us the colors, sand, rocks, and the shapes of late summer."" He wrote that after Bruce died and it has another couple lines to it. Anyway, so this was something I started, but I never finished it. And it's going to be some kind of water figure sometime.
It will happen one of these days. It's only been 13 years, 12 years.
Sholtz and Gavron (2006) remind us that clay work; the process of handling, manipulating and sculpting clay, taps into primary modes of expression that may have evolved before verbal language and these modes of expression are linked to actual feeling and memories that were encoded through touch and movement. Joy Fox and I discussed how comforting it was for her to just hold a lump of clay. Simply to hold it, feel its coolness and plasticity means something to her in her most primary ways of giving and receiving. The clay invites her and continues to invite even now when she might prefer to draw.
Historically, clay has been used by many cultures as a connective medium to the spirit world. It is believed that many of the oldest clay figures were used in magical and ritual ceremony as symbols of goddess or god and symbols of power over the natural world. Joy Fox’s sculptures are undeniably totems of power.
From my perspective, when an artist chooses to create in most cases the act of creating occurs between artist and art in the imaginal realm where the work becomes spiritualized, where creativity begins to speak as the work itself. However some artists invite a change agent into the process that influences this conversation by its very presence and character. The artist must always remain humble and step aside in the act of allowing. To involve an element such as fire, invites an other of no mind. It is not an other that has propensity to create. Fire releases energy and converts substances in ways that demand respect. An artist who creates in partnership with fire must have an inner core that can withstand and that has known change in all venues through the continuum so as not to fear it.
Fire is not patient like water is. Fire is willful where water is nurturing and familiar and knows us better than we know ourselves. I would not say Joy Fox has faith in the fire so much as she has faith in the willfulness or the language of releasing that belongs to fire. To make a form by muscling the fine silt of the earth, water assists and helps the form to evolve. The artist’s energy is pounded, folded, and kneaded into the clay. The creation of forms from clay comes from the deepest center of the soul. Fire then releases it, releasing Joy Fox to the very same time and space of the ancients the first potters and all others in between.
The invitation of the clay is a call to the work for Joy Fox to re-remember in the most primal way, as the feel of the clay in her hands was the same feeling for all the ancestors. This medium has never changed and requires the movements; touch sensations, and wordless communication as the earliest humans experienced. She converses with the ancestors as she works, her images are tributes to the creatures and elements of nature, gods, and time. The ancestors return through her, through her work and her offerings to the fire.
The question of where crisis appears for Joy Fox posed an interesting challenge of stepping back from the voices she has included in her choir of creation, or the council of elements and ancestors. The images of the tall sculptures rising out of the desert keep reappearing in my mind. I see them welcoming me to enter the gate to her home, I see them lined up along the front of her studio and surrounding the table where she works the clay. Large pieces sit covered in plastic to keep them moist, I see the parts and pieces laying in piles, groups, and arrangements. The surfaces of the pieces as individual works of art reveal symbols, landscapes, and poetry. I remember Joy Fox’s account of the turning point where her work became less and less utilitarian. Her first departure from objects of use were small human figures and it occurred to me that they may not have been small in a fetish-like way, but small as in the distance. They were muses in the distance, on the horizon and their arrival changed everything.
Artistic crisis requires something from a seasoned artist, it requires the nod of reassurance and faith; and so to find Joy Fox’s crises I looked for her faith.
""Things sometimes just don't go too well. I just usually work through it. Sometimes I have to leave it alone, go to something else. Sometimes I have to go sit in my chair, and look at images or I do a lot of visualization. Sometimes I just go over there, sit there, and look out the window, and think. I guess you'd call it visualizing."" (Joy Fox, interview, August 2013)
Dismemberment aptly sums the character and creative space of Joy Fox’s call to transformation. Not only do the works function as art in the dismembered state, but they seem to want to have their say in how they are “re-membered” within the work. I suspect now at the point of dismemberment the ancestral voice of clay and the willful voice of fire have finally quieted down. She sits waiting for her own intimate conversation with the work and the “spiritualizing” of the piece. For this to happen she must face dismemberment and follow the soul of the work, she must listen to that sacred language of no words.
Reconstructing the bones that have returned from the dust of the earth, returned from the fire of the universe now require something of Joy Fox in order to be spiritualized, they require what Romanyshyn (2007) discusses as the Fifth Moment: dismemberment, mourning, transformation in the Six Orphic Moments. Orphism teaches that human souls are divine and eternal and destined to repeated cycles of grieving in order to evolve and advance. With each stage of development, there is a looking back at the unsaid, undone, or unresolved; a letting go and then a move forward. All of these stages involve a unique character of grief.
Romanyshyn (2007) makes the analogy of these cycles to research and the search for self appropriately, and when art becomes a path of discovery, self awakening, spiritualization it too moves within the cycle. The Six Moments in the cycle are characterized by Romanyshyn (2007, p. 61) as: Being Claimed by the Work, Losing the Work/Mourning as Invitation, Descending into the Work/Mourning as Denial, Looking Back at the Work/Mourning as Separation, Dismembered by the Work/Mourning as Transformation, and The Eurydician Question: Mourning as Individuation.
Each of these moments can be found in Fox’s process, but crisis enters the scene in the fifth moment, the moment of confronting dismemberment. In the fifth moment, the artist must let go of the work and imagine it in a different way. The clay has been worked, formed, carved, and fired into the heads, arms, and trunks of the sculptures. Until now, the ancestors have assisted Fox, up until now she has been with child and pregnant with a “being” she can’t see or know. She sets the fired pieces out and waits letting go of her own involvement in the individual forms and surfaces knowing that they will now take on a different reality, the work will come into its own. There is a very subtle process of re-contextualizing and detaching; a moment of grief, and then movement to the stage of individuation (sixth) when the pieces become an individual. It would follow that once that happens, as Fox indicated, she is done with the piece and wants it to leave the studio either to be shown or live elsewhere.
If you look at Joy Fox’s work as the reversal of the process of death and the movement toward rebirth the true sacrifice exists as it did for Orpheus in mourning and in grief. Dust, earth, clay as the forgotten reconstructed by the water, nourishment. The energy of creator voices of the continuum form and resurrect the bones, fire releases from the world of the dead and the past, and now grief must be revisited and “re-membered”. Transformation and spiritualization comes from the process remembering and then moves to individuation bringing the work into being.
The earth, the iron of the clay have absorbed into the skin of Fox’s hands and arms as she gathered the dust from the scatters of time to stand and witness again as sages. Their stories now can be known from their one or many faces, their scarred surfaces of journey and the animal parts that assist them.
I watched while at the highest place on Joy Fox’s property a new grouping of the giant talismans were placed and she was directing the instillation of lights for the interiors of these “beings”. They would light the hilltop in the lonely darkness of the desert. Weren’t they now able to send light back to the stars and the continuum? I believe so. To a great extent, I see Fox in her “sorcery of resurrecting”, having been granted ancient alchemical secrets, successfully returning home to The Beginning.

"Operation Orange-tip: 2021
The Orange-tip (Anthocharis cardamines) is a common and beautiful butterfly, typically emerging late March or early April. The males, with their bright orange colouration,
wander widely and, to many of us, herald the start of spring.
My recently updated digital atlas of the county's butterflies has revealed the patchy
distribution of this species in Montgomeryshire. This Spring, I need your help to better understand where this charismatic butterfly occurs in the county
and to help fill in holes in its distribution map (below). All records are helpful but finding the butterfly in new areas (or places where it has not been seen for many years)
would be particularly exciting. If you are able to explore new areas, remember to stick to public footpaths or gain the landowner's permission.
Even if you don't manage to spot an Orange-tip, details of any other butterflies you may see will be extremely helpful, as the true distributions of most of our county's
butterflies are also poorly known.
I've set up an iRecord Activity for 'Operation Orange-tip' and you can submit your sightings directly using
You can view other records that have been submitted for the project, allowing you to track the progress of the 2021 sightings in real-time.
Alternatively, please send your sightings directly to the county recorder by email
(see Contact page if you don't have my email), and these records will be manually added to the project
(please remember to include a date, OS grid reference, and a site name that can be found on a map, e.g. nearest village, for any sightings). It will be fascinating to see
how many squares we can record the species in during 2021, as well as hopefully find this butterfy in some new places.
Records submitted through Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust/Biodiversity Information Service's
casual recording form,
smartphone app or the
Garden Butterfly Survey are also welcomed, though these will not be added to the iRecord Activity in real-time.
A high resolution and zoomable distribution map for Orange-tip can be downloaded here:

"Soapstone is a very misunderstood countertop material, so I thought it would be fun to do an interview with someone who has Soapstone countertops in their own home.
I have been reading Rachele's lovely blog, The Conscious Kitchen, for awhile now. Rachele lives in Portland, Oregon and has had her Soapstone countertops for just over a year now. We did not do the fabrication and installation of these countertops, we had nothing to do with her kitchen. I'm just a reader of her blog.
So without further ado, here is my interview with Rachele from The Conscious Kitchen...
Steph: Who was your fabricator and where did your beautiful Soapstone come from?
Rachele: Shadley's Soapstone, headquartered in Sun River, OR.
My stone source was Dorado Soapstone. My slabs were officially procured through the Denver warehouse, however, my lot of slabs was intercepted at port in Northern California and then brought straight to Oregon.
I highly recommend both Shadley and Dorado! Both were very experienced and knowledgeable, not to mention patient and helpful.
Steph: I LOVE your island. The veining in the Soapstone is amazing. Did you pick out your exact slabs? Did you lay out your slabs with your fabricator?
Rachele: Yes, it's actually a pretty good story! I was going through some photos sent by Dorado which showed me everything that was in stock at the moment. None of the slabs ""spoke"" to me so I called up Dorado to see when their next shipments were arriving. I happened to get the president on the phone, and he personally emailed me pictures he had taken of some slabs that were still on the ship. I opened the attachments and immediately fired off an email to both Dorado and Shadley's telling them that I had to have that stone!
After the fabricator templated my island, we went together to lay the template on the slab (which was sitting in my driveway) and found the exact right spot. We were limited somewhat by the slab itself, of course, but I was really happy with the result.
I also felt like the veining could be a different mineral/inclusion and I wanted to be SURE it wouldn't stain. It was July and very hot outside. With Shadley's permission, I took a bottle of balsamic vinegar and poured about a cup right on the veining. I came back an hour later to wipe it off and of course, no stain! I then gave Shadley the go-ahead to cut the slab as we had identified with the template.
Steph: The prep sink in the island, was it custom made by your fabricator? How do you feel about the size of it? Too big? Too small? Just right?
Rachele: The prep sink is not stone -- it's a Blanco Silgranit sink, installed undermount with a very slight negative reveal. The size is perhaps a couple inches too small in width. I can easily use it for all of my functions (for example, it's just right for rinsing off a chicken or spinning my salad greens), but I would like it to feel a bit bigger. A very minor nit. I would not want to actually upgrade to the larger Silgranit.Steph: Your main sink, do you like the single basin? Why did you decide on this design vs. a double basin sink?
Rachele: I LOVE the single basin. I do not use a dish rack and I don't need another basin for washing produce (that is done in the island), so I have no obvious need to split up my main sink. I can put my widest pots, or even sheet pans, in the sink to soak. With the off-center drain, I can have lots of dirty dishes accumulate in my sink yet still have free and clear access to the drain and disposer. (I would like to load my dishes promptly in the dishwasher, and not have dirty dishes in the sink, but that's just not my reality!)
Steph: I noticed a hot water dispenser, do you use it? Was it worth the money?
Rachele: We use it all the time. It is SO worth the money! My husband likes it for his tea. I warm up my baby's milk bottles in bowls of hot water. I get a bit of hot water on a cloth for cleaning up sticky spots in a flash. We use the hot water to make oatmeal quickly in the morning. Those are the main uses in our house.
Steph: Also, is that a soap dispenser? We install a lot of soap dispensers and then people tell us they don't use them. Do you use it?
Rachele: Yes, that is a soap dispenser. We use it, however, I'm not happy with it. I had soap dispensers in previous houses (I think they were Grohe dispensers) that worked great. I have three soap dispensers in my kitchen now -- two Blanco and one Kohler -- and I only like one of the three (one of the Blancos). The other two seem to stick a lot. In fact, the two Blancos are identical except for color, and one sticks but the other works great. Soap dispensers can be expensive and I can't bring myself to spend the money to try out some other ones (it's always harder to bring yourself to spend yet more money at the end of a remodel!).
Steph: How often do you oil your soapstone?
Rachele: At first every two weeks, and now every two months. I would like to do it every month, but life is busy. I keep an oil rag in a sealed ziploc baggie next to my oil can. My understanding is that when my stone is several years old, and has oxidized more, then I won't ""need"" to oil it at all. I quote ""need"" because soapstone does not need to be oiled -- it's just a cosmetic preference.
Steph: I saw the picture of the chip on your blog. Do you know what caused the 3-4 chips that you have?
Rachele: I do not know, but I suspect that I was emptying a stock pot into the prep sink in a rather clumsy fashion, and hitting the sink rim with the edge of a stockpot. I have never noticed a chip as it has happened.
Rachele: If 1 is not at all, and 10 is the worst, I would rate it as a 3. Neither of them occur very frequently. We've had about 3 scratches in the year we've had the stone, and all were easily oiled out. We have water spots weekly, but I have noticed as the stone ages, they are gradually less pronounced. (Or, maybe I am just getting used to them.)
Rachele: Despite the drama of the veining, that I do love, I feel overall that it's a very humble, unassuming, low maintenance, healthy, functional stone. I just love that. I guess I can't pick one single attribute. :)
Steph: What is your least favorite part of the soapstone?
Rachele: I'm not too keen on the fact that I had to have it shipped via boat from Brazil. I focused on local sources for my kitchen where I could, but I just really wanted soapstone. There are domestic soapstone options also, but those were 20%-3% more and thus, out of my budget.
Steph: What do you use to clean your countertops?
Rachele: Most of the time, I just use my instant hot water with a microfiber rag. Sometimes I hit with a homemade cleaner of simply diluted vinegar, because that is what Shadley recommended to me. If I get raw meat on the counter, or anything else that gives heebie jeebies, then I will use a stronger cleaner, but that is pretty rare.
Steph: I love the vertical soapstone piece at the cooktop. What caused this design decision?
Rachele: We HAD to have two cooktops -- a gas griddle and an induction top. With the size of our kitchen, and wanting to buy just one venthood, they had to be installed side by side. The griddle is a very commercial industrial aesthetic. The cooktop is sleek, Euro, minimal. Quite a design challenge! It was impossible to make the griddle sleeker, so instead I chose to add some heft to the induction top with the ""apron front"" of soapstone. I had wanted to fabricate a steel countertop with the exact same edge profile as the griddle, but that was surprisingly very expensive. So I got the idea for the soapstone apron while driving around one day, and I called up Shadley immediately to propose the idea. They were game to try it. It required a lot of communication and coordination between my cabinetry installers and Shadley.
Steph: Any regrets as far as the countertops go?
Steph: Do you like the square edge detail on your countertops? Would you change it if you were to do it again?
Rachele: Yes, I do like it. You don't really have many other options with soapstone -- unlike some other stones, the bullnose or other rounded edges actually chip more in soapstone. But, as you can tell from my kitchen, I have a very square aesthetic, so the square edge is my first choice.
Steph: Would you recommend soapstone to your friends and family?
Rachele: No, because I don't think it's a universal stone. I do have some friends and clients who I am sure, would love it. I will get it again in a heartbeat. But, it's certainly not for everyone.
Thank you so much Rachele for being a willing participant in this interview!

"There are times when we all need a bit of extra cash.
There are times when we all need a bit of extra cash. Whether it's to help pay the bills after the Christmas splurge or because your wedding planning is spinning out of control, there are a few ways to extend your budget. Two of the most common are credit cards and personal loans. Both can have their benefits, but it's important to make sure you don't over-extend yourself. When times are tough or you need money urgently, it can be tempting to apply for multiple forms of credit. However, there are reasons why you shouldn't make too many applications at the same time. The effect of multiple loans/cards Having multiple loans or credit cards isn't in itself a good or a bad thing, but the way you use them can impact your credit rating (both negatively and positively). If you make regular repayments and keep up to date with all your debts, this can be beneficial for your credit rating. However, your combined credit limit could affect your future applications, as you may be offered a smaller loan amount. This is where a personal loan has a benefit over a credit card (or multiple credit cards). Having an end date for your loan and not a rolling credit option can be a big plus. The effect of multiple applications Whenever you make an application – whether that's for a loan, a credit card, a mortgage or any other form of credit – it is recorded in your credit history, including whether the application is successful or not. Each application stays on there for five years. While it's not necessarily a bad thing to have a history of applications, it can have a negative effect if you make multiple applications within a short space of time, as this can make your financial situation look unstable to lenders. If you get rejected for credit at any point, it's recommended that you wait at least three months before you try again to avoid this. Applying smartly If you're in need of money, common wisdom says you should only make one application in order to keep your credit rating healthy. So what finance option should you apply for? That depends on your own personal situation, but some important things to consider are:
Checking your credit rating It's possible to check your credit rating so you know what information financial organisations are looking at. The government's Moneysmart site recommends the following free tools (with the disclaimer that they may vary slightly in the way that they report your score):
Some tools restrict how often you can get a free report (such as once a year or within 90 days of being rejected for credit), so be careful how you use them. Keeping your credit rating healthy As well as making sure you restrict your loan and credit card applications to a safe amount, there are a few other things you can do to help keep your credit rating strong and healthy, which will make applying for loans easier in the future:

"Smart Dogs Love Brain Work!
Smart Dogs Love Brain Work – and all dogs are smart!
Did you know that it’s quite possible to improve your dog’s health and wellbeing with particular training methods? It’s true. Correct ongoing training of your dog can result in increased vitality so your dog will actually spend less time sleeping. S/he’ll be more alert, but also when your dog sleeps, s/he’ll have a really healthy, restful sleep!
Have you ever noticed how some dogs seem to “listen” to their owners more than others? Is your dog like that? Or is your dog like most dogs – probably listens to commands some of the time, but sometimes tests you or simply takes no notice? Many dogs are like that unless they’ve been really well trained from the start, or they receive ongoing training from their owners.
Most people assume that training your dog for a few weeks or months when s/he is young will be sufficient for life. But training as an ongoing process has great benefits for your dog.
Dogs love training sessions. Can you guess why? That’s right – because you’re spending time one on one with your dog. And that’s what your dog wants most of all!
The idea of giving your dog appropriate mental stimulation (brain work) is not well understood by the general public, or even by the majority of conventional dog trainers either. Traditional dog training has been developed from the assumption that dogs can be transformed into little more than robots – the basis of almost all training is to train dogs to respond automatically to certain command words, and to respond in exactly the same way each time to each command.
Such training completely ignores your dog’s innate intelligence.
If your dog is in “mental balance”, then s/he will be happier. And you can actually see when your dog is happy and content, can’t you? The object is to take care of your dog and train him/her on your dog’s own terms, while still maintaining ultimate control. (Of course, it goes without saying that you never want to lose your spot as the top dog). You can actually take all the tedium out of dog training, and you won’t risk boring your dog to tears in the process, either.
Sounds interesting, doesn’t it? I was intrigued, anyway.
Mogen Eliasen is a dog trainer from Denmark. He’s an expert in animal behavior, and has been studying dogs and developing better training methods for dogs for the past 30 years. Mogen advocates training which does take into account your dog’s intelligence, and this method really works. And as an added bonus, it also works to correct a lot of undesirable behaviors that some dogs seem to have.
Happiness and mental stimulation are great for your dog’s health and wellbeing!",<urn:uuid:6fa620a3-ec2e-4a0a-b842-5ce64269926b>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.healthyhappydogs.com/smart-dogs-love-brain-work/,2024-02-20T22:12:57Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9628760814666748,610,1.9786913394927979,2

"In Shakespeare, John of Gaunt says:
Methinks I am a prophet new inspiredJust a good quote, apropos of nothing.
And thus expiring do foretell of him:
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
1. The oldest active international treaty in the world – it’s been bruised a few times, but never repealed – dates (more or less) to 1373. What two European sea powers pledged eternal friendship in 1373, and then managed to more or less follow through on it over the centuries since?
2. Sometime about now, according to legend, a local woman living about 350 kilometers south of Angkor was gathering firewood when she noticed an unusual tree floating by. Fishing it out, she found statues of Buddha and Vishnu inside. This was considered highly auspicious, and a town was built on the site that would replace Angkor as the Khmer capital in the 1430s. It’s still more or less the Khmer capital today! What city was built where “Grandma Penh” was out looking for firewood?
3. In the early 1370s, co-emperor Andronikos IV Palaiologos rebeled against his father John V Palaiologos for agreeing to make their empire vassal to the Ottomans. The rebellion failed and the Ottomans pressured the father to have his son blinded. This is surprisingly typical stuff in the late history of what political entity?
4. 1374 was a big year for this important English civil servant; he was given a royal grant of a gallon of wine a day for the rest of his life (it was later converted to a cash stipend) and got an important new gig as comptroller of the customs for the port of London. We think of him today mostly as a writer, and indeed by ’74 his The Book of the Duchess (also known as The Deth of Blaunche) was probably a best-seller by the standards of the day. Who was this well-rounded guy?
5. In 1374, the weakness of the Marinid Dynasty became obvious as, following a succession struggle, the empire fragmented into two parts: the Kingdom of Fes and the Kingdom of Marrakech. What modern country is successor to the Marinids?
6. In 1376, Catherine of Sienna put a lot of effort into trying to convince Pope Gregory XI to take a major step. In 1377, he took that step, and people have been wondering ever since about how much influence Catherine had in the decision. What did Pope Gregory do in 1377?
7. John of Gaunt was among the most powerful and richest men in his country, and probably in all of Europe, in his heyday, and the 1370s were definitely part of his heyday. Who, approximately, was John of Gaunt?
8. Here are some images that people worked really hard on in the 1370s. Which one was made for the King of England, which one was made in Italy, and where were the other two made?
9. The Ayutthaya Kingdom, gradually expanding from its heartland along the Chao Phraya River, made the formerly dominant kingdom of Sukhothai its northern vassal state in 1378. The two kingdoms then merged into what modern kingdom?
10. According to a 15th century historian, Egyptian peasants in 1378 made offerings to a large idol in hopes of a good harvest. One Sa'im al-Dahr, upset by this idolatry, committed an epic act of vandalism for which he was later executed. What did Sa’im al-Dahr (and not, contrary to popular legend, Napolean’s infantry) do?

"Philip Roth, considered by many to be one of the leading Jewish American literary voices of the twentieth century, announced that he will no longer be writing books.
The highly controversial figure, who first gained international recognition for his 1959 novella ""Goodbye, Columbus""—an irreverent portrait of American Jewish life in post World War II that earned him the National Book Award for Fiction—announced his literary retirement in a rare interview with a French pop culture publication, Les Inrocks.
While the French publication is unfamiliar to most American readers, the news soon spread after hitting Twitter and other social networking sites.
In the interview set to promote the release the French edition of “Nemesis,” his latest novel, Roth confirmed that it will, in fact, be his last.
“I have no intention to write for the next ten years. Quite frankly, I’m done,” Roth said.
Roth, 78, said a few years ago he had set out to re-read some of the books he had loved in his younger years, and then decided to re-read his own works, starting backwards with “Nemesis” all the way to “Portnoy’s Complaint”—the humorous and sexually explicit psychoanalytic monologue of a lust-ridden, self-deprecating Jewish teenager, which although wildly received by the larger literary community, prompted harsh condemnations from much of the Jewish establishment.
“And after that I decided I was done with fiction,” said Roth, who has authored approximately 30 books and won scores of international awards.
“And if I write another book, it will probably be a flop,” he added. ”Who needs to read another mediocre book?” he says. “I’m 78, and I don’t know anything about America today. I watch it on TV. But I no longer live it.”
Roth said, though, that his retirement from fiction doesn’t mean he has been sitting idly at home. He told the interviewer that he has spent the last three years working on his archives for his biographer, Blake Bailey. “If I die without leaving him something, where is he going to start?” Roth said.",<urn:uuid:8b817268-432b-4d53-b80c-1b35387c0fd0>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/161957,2024-02-20T23:17:15Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9823691248893738,483,1.4661730527877808,1
"Recently, I started a fitness programme on Runkeeper. I bit the bullet and parted with £25 of my hard earned cash to upgrade to Runkeeper Go. Mainly I wanted to be able to use the fitness plans, but it’s cool to get more data too. I’m all about that data and them graphs. It’s really good because you can put in your target and when you want to complete it by, and it will work out a plan for you. I’m aiming for ten miles by October 22, so that’s what I put in and now I’m running to a plan made for me.
Today was day three of the plan. Days one and two were alternate 2 minute runs and 2 minute walks for a total of twenty minutes. I can run comfortably for almost 20 minutes, so I thought it wouldn’t be that challenging. For some reason it still was. Maybe it’s more of a mental thing. When there’s a particular time limit involved I tend to be waiting for the end the whole time, whereas running without a plan I just stop when I’m done.
This run was a bit different. This run was a distance run, not a time run. I had to run for 400m then walk for 400m, six times. Now, I am terrible at judging distances. I know roughly what one metre looks like, but as soon as you start making it into an actual distance, not a clue. 400m to me sounded like an awful lot. I was expecting to be running for AGES each time.
My usual running route has an uphill part no matter how you plan it. Southampton Common is just like that. But it does also mean there’s a downhill part at some point too. One of the uphill ways is steeper, but slightly shorter, whereas the other one is more gradual but still really brutal. If anything it’s worse because you forget it’s a hill until you’re knackered after a minute of running. I decided to go the steeper way, as that would mean I had more downhill parts on the run back home. For my SUPER LONG 400m bits.
Only, it turns out that 400m is basically nothing. I started running very slowly to make sure I could keep the stamina to do the distance uphill. I didn’t even make it to the hilly part before Runkeeper told me to slow down for the next 400m. After just a couple of minutes I was walking through the tree thinking to myself “that’s…it?!”. It was. Just that, but five more times.
My slow first run really affected my time, but speeding up on the subsequent runs knocked about a minute off my average. Still not a great speed, but I know I’ll do better next time. And that’s what matters, really.
Before I knew it, 45 minutes had passed and my run was over. It’s quite nice breaking it up into walking/running intervals because it kind of chunks it. But I will be RUNNING the ten miles on October 22nd. No chunking that one. I think I’ll set Runkeeper to tell me after I’ve completed each mile on the day, just so I know where I’m at. Then I’ll feel like I’m achieving something as I go round. Plus, just aiming to complete each mile one at a time is way more manageable than thinking about completing ten of them. I suppose that is kind of chunking it.
Next week I’m going to focus on my speed a bit more. If I carry on averaging like I did today, it’ll take me three hours to complete the Great South Run. That is Too Long. Hopefully I’ll be writing next week about how much my speed has improved 🙂

"Mark Morford: Conservative Women Are â€œPseudo-Womenâ€ and â€œBitchesâ€
Originally published on June 28, 2010 at David Horowitz’s NewsReal
Mark Morford, misogynist Obama worshipper
Mark Morford’s San Francisco Chronicle column is what a leftist’s diary might look like — if that leftist was a horny 14-year-old with a man-sized crush on Obama and a predilection for verbally abusing conservative women. Hmm. Scratch that. Morford’s column is exactly what a leftist’s diary would look like.
You might recognize Morford as the drooling Obama fetishist who proclaimed candidate Obama a “rare kind of attuned being” and a “Lightworker.” Or perhaps you remember his enlightened progressive description of “docile doormat” Laura Bush as “the ideal Republican wife: Prim, sexless, nearly useless, lets the men do the real thinkin.”
So really, who better to appoint himself this week’s Grand Arbiter of True Feminism?
Finding few reasons to gush about the Obama presidency, Morford’s current mission is to expose the “perverted kind of new womanhood” of Sarah Palin, Meg Whitman, and Nikki Haley. Ladies of the Left beware! warns Morford. The success of these “largely insufferable” conservative women comes packaged with a “s–bag of downsides, drawbacks, jackals and bitches.”
You kiss your mama with that mouth, Mark?
After a handful of slobbering sentences about progressive men with “perfectly sculpted genitalia” (no, I’m not kidding) and several more about their fat and sweaty Republican counterparts, Morford uses his column to explain that conservative women aren’t allowed to be feminists and don’t actually qualify as women anyway:
Witness, won’t you, the zeitgeist’s nightmare trifecta of largely insufferable women, the Sarah Palin/Carly Fiorina/Michele Bachmann hydra-headed hellbeast of pseudo-women, one part huge cash reserves, one part evil grammar-abusing ditzball psychopath, one part sassy misinformed moxie, overlaid with wonky ideas of motherhood, love of guns and ignorance of sex and reproductive rights.
These, along with Meg “I’m a Billionaire!” Whitman and Nikki “Sarah Palin hugged me!” Haley, et al, are the apparent “champions” of a perverted kind of new womanhood, some sort of mutant breed who claim it’s entirely possible, even desirable to be “pro-life and pro-feminist,” which is a bit like saying you’re “pro-oil spill and pro-environment.”
In other words: Sorry, no. No f–ing way. This is the rule: You do not ever get to say you’re any kind of feminist or champion of women and mothers everywhere, and in the same breath add that you also believe no woman should have control over her reproductive powers and, by the way, poor immigrant women should be sent back to Mexico and guns should be legal for all.
Another day, another tiresome attempt to dehumanize conservative women and belittle their accomplishments with absurd caricatures, vicious insults, and largely insufferable prose.
But at least Morford’s portrayal of successful conservative women as “some sort of mutant breed” of “pseudo-women” was condemned by the feminist Left, wasn’t it? No, as usual a man who calls himself progressive gets a free pass on misogyny as leftist women lap up puddles of his hateful venom.
A Jezebel writer calls his piece “a thoughtful column.” “Love this thoughtful and insightful rant,” writes Caitlin Kelly at True/Slant. British journalist Alison Clarke thinks Morford is “just plain wrong,” but only because he fails to acknowledge that enlightened feminists like her already know that conservative women are “a whole delightful s–bag of downsides.”
Men on the Left have had it affirmed for them time and again that misogyny is perfectly acceptable – even desirable – as long as women on the Right are the targets. Even public rape fantasies about conservative women are excused. As long as these men are good little lefty foot soldiers, they’re welcome to direct all manner of misogyny toward women who fail to toe the line on abortion, gun control, and illegal immigration.
So, Mark. As long as we’re making up rules, here’s one for you: You do not ever get to create feminist litmus tests, and in the same breath call Sarah Palin, Nikki Haley, and others pseudo-women and bitches.
I think it’s clear who the real anti-feminist is.

Captain of the Starship Stetsun – illustration
The Combination of two most beloved genre fiction themes, the classic sci-fi and western. By throwing these two almighty themes together it has resulted in a narrative of my own imaging. The concept: If the Cowboys of the Old West found a way to propel themselves into Space to colonise a planet.
The crew, a renegade gang of gunslingers, outlawed and wanted on Earth, escape, travelling through the far reaches of Space. They live within a beat up a space vessel, their home, a ship called ‘Stetson.’ The planet they encounter, a dusty thing that bares resemblance to their own familiar Wild West. A planet they declare as ‘New Texus.’
The planet inhabits life, subterranean aliens that disguise themselves as cacti, living beneath the dirt to protect themselves from far meaner creatures. Herds of docile cattle roam and graze, resembling Earth’s own but their hides are rainbow and star speckled. Crueler creatures live in the dark, hiding in the crumbling mountain’s shadow, venomous critters and howling beasts. Nothing the gunslinging crew of the Starship ‘Stetson’ can’t handle with the big irons on their hips.

I occasianlly run into Segmentation fault in my simulations but recently
they become more often. I use NAMD2.9 which I downloaded from NAMD site as
It manifests on two of my machines so far, hence I don't expect any
troubles with hardware. Both machines are running Debian wheezy, but with
different GPU card. I have tried several versions of nvidia drivers.
The simulation usually runs for 10 to 25 hours before it crashes.
Are there any actions I should take in order to debug the segfault?

"Kiev’s storm troopers fought to a standstill
Now that the forces of resistance have fought the stormtroopers of the fascist junta to a standstill, obliging Kiev to moderate its warmongering bluster and creep to the negotiating table in Minsk, it is more than ever urgent for us to stand in solidarity with the people of Donetsk and Lugansk. It is their inspiring courage and endurance, reinforced by the diplomatic firmness of Russia, that has humbled the junta and created, at the least, the possibility of a just political solution of a crisis that has, from the first, been provoked by imperialism.
Back in February when the elected government of President Yanukovich was overturned in a violent putsch which installed a fascist junta acting as a catspaw for NATO expansion, the people of Crimea reacted swiftly, delivering a referendum result which freed them to rejoin Russia. Following suit, the people of Donetsk and Lugansk also declared for independence through referenda.
Enraged by this demonstration of the popular will, the puppet Poroshenko hijacked Ukraine’s regular army, backed up by the fascist National Guard, and began a summer-long campaign of military terror against the south and east of the country, with a heavy cost in human lives. In one month alone, from 16 July till 17 August , the UN registered at least 1,200 deaths and 3,250 injured, as Kiev exploited its superiority in numbers and weaponry to heap death and destruction upon Slavyansk, Donetsk and Lugansk, unleashing indiscriminate artillery and air attacks upon major population centres. The UN estimates that the death toll now tops 3,000 and continues to rise as the “ceasefire” is repeatedly breached by Kiev’s forces.
Through a long hot summer the resistance forces were heavily outgunned and outmanned. However, many soldiers of the regular army were so reluctant to fire on “their own people” that the hardcore fascists of the National Guard had to be brought in to enforce discipline. Meanwhile back at home the families of conscript soldiers due to be sent out east protested against Poroshenko’s dirty war, strewing felled trees or even their own bodies across the road to block the passage of troop transports.
Meanwhile the people’s militias, strongly motivated by the justice of their cause, gradually compensated for their inferiority in arms and numbers by resorting to classic guerilla tactics: avoiding direct frontal battles, harrying the enemy’s supply lines and encircling large numbers of troops with a smaller number of partisans, often securing the surrender of war-weary conscripts and the capture of enemy weaponry. So successful have these tactics proven to be that the beginning of September saw Kiev’s forces fought to a humiliating stalemate after a stunning series of defeats.
BBC Lie Machine
Throughout Kiev’s bloody onslaught, the West has kept up a barrage of threats and sanctions against Russia, whilst the BBC and the rest of the imperialist media disgorged an endless stream of propaganda painting the anti-fascist resistance as “rebels”, making baseless allegations over the MH17 aircraft disaster, pretending to spot “invading Russian troops” behind every bush and weeping crocodile tears over the tragic human consequences of a civil war which from the first had been instigated by the West itself, in furtherance of plans to expand NATO up to the border of Russia.
But then suddenly at the beginning of September, with the rolling back of Kiev’s offensive, the media spin doctors were at sixes and sevens. As it became clear that the Kiev forces were on the rocks, the media’s first reaction was to claim that this signalled the much-touted “Russian invasion”. But when it became obvious that no such invasion existed, that in fact the rebuff suffered by Kiev’s demoralised forces was entirely the work of the anti-fascist resistance, the media suddenly clammed up. Under no circumstances could it be admitted that it was the partisans themselves that had put such a dent in the junta’s war machine.
Now the Western campaign of disinformation has a fresh hurdle to jump, as OSCE inspectors (Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe) and other eye witnesses start to report back on some of the atrocities committed by the army and the National Guard during their occupation of territory that has since been liberated by the resistance. These revelations create new difficulties for those who would sanitise Kiev’s reign of terror. On 23 and 24 September, resistance forces investigating in the vicinity of the Kommunar Mine, 60 kilometres from Donetsk, an area recently occupied by Kiev forces, exhumed four bodies of three men and one woman. Their hands were tied, and one had been decapitated. On 25 September the OSCE reported that some of the victims were killed a month ago (i.e. during the period of fascist occupation). The inspectors reported seeing “a hill of earth, resembling a grave” and a sign with the initials of five people, the date of their death (27 August”), and the phrase “Died for Putin’s lies”. In addition the OSCE team found a total of three burial sites.
Worse still, Madina Dzharbusynova, the OSCE’s special representative on combating trafficking in Human Biomaterial, went on TV to report that it was possible that the bodies found in mass graves in the Donbass could has been stripped of saleable internal organs. She reported that ” At a meeting of the OSCE focusing on implementing human rights obligations, members of NGOs working in this field pointed up that there were reports of mass graves in [Novorossiya], where, according to their testimony, the bodies buried lacked their internal organs, so, they raised a concern that there might be an illicit trade in such”.
Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has demanded a thorough investigation into the discovery of mass graves in south-eastern Ukraine, warning the West that ” We are counting on the fact that western capitals will not gloss over these facts – they are outrageous. We expect western media to cover the story objectively, while they clearly are trying to hush it up. I look forward to a clear, unbiased, responsible position from international organisations. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe is already there working. We will seek to establish the truth and punish those responsible.”
The BBC’s response to this evidence was precisely to “gloss over the facts”. Rather than support Russia’s level-headed call for a thorough investigation, the BBC is concerned only to pass off the accumulating evidence of massive war crimes as merely “Russian propaganda”.

Its that time of the year where do a total wardrobe change, clean out those spider webs on that old suitcase of yours, take out all those warm, cuddly clothes, clean them, stack them up neatly back into that now empty wardrobe and just stand there for a while in quite admiration of the aesthetics of what's in front of you. Because, at the end of the day, you know its not going to last too long.
But that's what I want to talk to you about right now. It's actually about a small side project I have been wanting to sink my fully formed, not so deformed, teeth into. Let's face it, I am a people person. I want to be in a state where I am surrounded by fun loving, easy going people. But as much as I love to force a fair share of my side of the story on someone else, I also love to hear what people have to say too. Its unique, its refreshing and its totally not me.
As part of madeinepal's third year anniversary next year on february, I am planning on publishing an e-book titled ""Tell Me Your Story"" on both the epub and the mobi format. That's all cool and great, but what I need is something that's different, that's unique; something that's a page turner. That's where you come in.
I want YOUR story.
For that to happen though, you need to qualify certain set of skills which I have outlined below:
1. Can type on a computer on a word processing software.
2. Has a story to tell.
3. Does not know how to be funny.

"How to define my ten favorites of the year 2010? The obvious criteria is that the photo must have been taken in the year 2010. But for a lot of photographers, myself included, photography is a multi-step process, the two most important steps being taking the shot, and post-processing. What if taking the shot occurred before this year, but post-processing occurred this year? Does that count? Should it?
For my best of the year, my answer is yes. A shot taken in a previous year, but post-processed this year can count as one of my best of the year. So, here is my year 2010 top photos. I will display five today and have already displayed five yesterday. And a bit of history behind the photo.
This top ten is in no particular order.

"An annulment declares that the marriage never occurred because of some defect. Defective marriages may be either void or voidable. In a void marriage, the circumstances are such that the marriage could never have come into being. A voidable marriage is recognized under the law as a valid marriage until an action is brought to prove it invalid.
Annulments may be granted where the requirements for establishing either a statutory law marriage or a common law marriage have not been met.
A ground for obtaining an annulment is lack of cohabitation (living together as husband and wife). If the marriage has not been consummated by cohabitation of the parties, the Court may declare such contract void for want of consent of either of the contracting parties or for any other reason that proves that the agreement of the parties to be married was not a valid contract.
Even if the parties have cohabitated as husband and wife, the Court may grant an annulment if the marriage is bigamous (one of the parties was already married to someone else) or incestuous (the parties are related to closely by blood or marriage as provided by South Carolina Law).
Duress is another ground for annulment. Threats or violence constituting duress, however, they must be of such a nature as to inspire a great fear of bodily harm in a person of ordinary firmness and it must dominate throughout the transaction to such an extent that the injured party could not and did not act as a free agent.
A marriage procured by certain kinds of fraud can also be annulled, unless the marriage has been consummated by cohabitation. The fraud must involve matters which constitute the essentials of the marriage relationship. The misrepresentations requisite for an annulment on the grounds of fraud might include fraudulent representations about sanity (but not about being treated for mental illness), impotency, sterility, or an inclination to have children or not to have children contrary to the premarital understanding. Misrepresentation about one party’s character, social standing or fortune is not grounds for annulment.",<urn:uuid:372af7e4-31bd-4828-a937-2a89f8046438>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.mclarenandlee.com/family-law-primer/terminating-the-marriage/annulment/,2024-02-20T23:05:32Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9695847034454346,429,1.836147427558899,2
"The average day for an ultrasound tech is varied, fast paced and demanding. While it requires a certain amount of education and credentialing, there are plenty of other factors hospitals and clinics take into account when hiring a new employee.
In this article, you’ll get a glimpse into what a diagnostic medical sonographer does and what personal and professional attributes make someone more appealing to employers.
A Day in the Life
Ultrasound techs operate complex medical equipment that uses sound waves to produce images of the inside of a patient’s body. Recent advancements in this technology allows sonographers to view fetuses and internal organs with stunning clarity.
Ultrasound techs prepare patients for imaging and use the equipment to gather clear images physicians use to check the health of an infant or diagnose a variety of medical issues. This equipment is used for far more than the imaging of unborn children. Today, ultrasound imaging can help prevent heart attacks and aid in the early detection of various health issues. As an ultrasound tech, you’ll help save lives every day.
Most technicians choose a specialty from one of several areas.
- Obstetrics: imaging of fetus and womb
- Gynecology: focuses on the female reproductive system
- Breast: aids in breast health and early detection of cancer
- Echocardiography: Used to analyze heart health, muscle and blood flow
- Musculoskeletal: used to analyze muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints
The dynamic and growing profession provides great opportunities for those who graduate an acredited program and earn the proper credentialing through the American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonographers. However, it takes more than technical skill and clinical experience.
Stamina: as an ultrasound tech, you’ll spend a lot of time on your feet. Duties often require pushing equipment from room-to-room to take images of patients. Sometimes, the techs need to move or turn patients to perform procedures. Comfortable shoes and a willingness to stay active are prime traits that every hospital looks for.
Attention to detail: for the sake of every patient, you’ll need to provide physicians with the highest-quality images possible to ensure the patients are analyzed and diagnosed properly. They must also be able to spot even minute issues that could require the immediate notification of an emergency physician.
People skills: This is a prime skill for any ultrasound tech and one hospitals put a premium on. Techs work day in and day out with patients, some of whom are dealing with serious illness. Others are simply anxious and need a calming person around. Becoming a technician means keeping a level head, even when things get stressful. Every patient should be treated with respect and consideration.
Technical savvy: that machine sonographers push around is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, may even millions. Having an ability to work with and comprehend complex medical instruments is a crucial part of the job that will make life a lot easier. There are several brands of imaging equipment used at hospitals, and you’ll need to learn to use them all.
Other Factors and Considerations
The road to becoming an ultrasound technician requires a lot of hard work and personal fortitude. The coursework will be complex and challenging. In many programs, you’ll also be required to complete more than 900 hours of clinical experience in a hospital setting.
There are no easy roads to break into such a rewarding and meaningful profession.

"How Much Do I Need to Save?
Many Americans realize the importance of saving for retirement, but knowing exactly how much they need to save is another issue altogether. With all the information available about retirement, it is sometimes difficult to decipher what is appropriate for your specific situation.
One rule of thumb is that retirees will need approximately 80% of their pre-retirement salaries to maintain their lifestyles in retirement. However, depending on your own situation and the type of retirement you hope to have, that number may be higher or lower.
Here are some factors to consider when determining a retirement savings goal.
The first factor to consider is the age at which you expect to retire. In reality, many people anticipate that they will retire later than they actually do; unexpected issues, such as health problems or workplace changes (downsizing, etc.), tend to stand in their way. Of course, the earlier you retire, the more money you will need to last throughout retirement. It’s important to prepare for unanticipated occurrences that could force you into an early retirement.
Although you can’t know what the duration of your life will be, there are a few factors that may give you a hint.
You should take into account your family history — how long your relatives have lived and diseases that are common in your family — as well as your own past and present health issues. Also consider that life spans are increasing with recent medical developments. More people will be living to age 100, or perhaps even longer. When calculating how much you need to save, you should factor in the number of years you expect to spend in retirement.
Future Health-Care Needs
Another factor to consider is the cost of health care. Health-care costs have been rising much faster than general inflation, and fewer employers are offering health benefits to retirees. Long-term care is another consideration. These costs could severely dip into your savings and even result in your filing for bankruptcy if the need for care is prolonged.
Another important consideration is your desired retirement lifestyle. Do you want to travel? Are you planning to be involved in philanthropic endeavors? Will you have an expensive country club membership? Are there any hobbies you would like to pursue? The answers to these questions can help you decide what additional costs your ideal retirement will require.
Many baby boomers expect that they will work part-time in retirement. However, if this is your intention and you find that working longer becomes impossible, you will still need the appropriate funds to support your retirement lifestyle.
If you think you have accounted for every possibility when constructing a savings goal but forget this vital component, your savings could be far from sufficient. Inflation has the potential to lower the value of your savings from year to year, significantly reducing your purchasing power over time. It is important for your savings to keep pace with or exceed inflation.
Many retirees believe that they can rely on their future Social Security benefits. However, this may not be true for you. The Social Security system is under increasing strain as more baby boomers are retiring and fewer workers are available to pay their benefits. And the reality is that Social Security currently provides about 40% of the total income of Americans aged 65 and older with at least $63,469 in annual household income.1 That leaves about 60% to be covered in other ways.
And the Total Is…
After considering all these factors, you should have a much better idea of how much you need to save for retirement.

"In this 2017 UCT Summer School Series, Dr Peter Ardington (BVSc SAVC) presents on “A Brown History of the World ~ Part 1”, where he discusses and presents on the history of mankind’s arrogance and sense of self-importance which has driven and is driving mankind’s care and more importantly lack thereof, into an unsustainable dilemma.
This two-part presentation will explore and analyse the environmentally negative influence of people from the emergence of our species, between 200,000 and 400, 000 years ago, up to the present.
There is a wide selection of forest, jungle, fresh and salt water, desert and tundra environments, however, we will be focusing on grasslands in general, because we are a bipedal, upright walking species of grassland primate, dependent on the grasslands for most of what supports us.
8 million years ago, two important changes reached a critical tipping point on earth, developing over time, being a) carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached an all-time low after 300 million years of exuberant forest growth and b) the drying out of large areas of the planet due to cooling from 30 million years ago to 8 million years ago.
The significance of these changes at that tipping point in time, was that those two changes were ‘hostile’ to trees who prefer high CO2 in the atmosphere and wet conditions, the term ‘tropical rain forest’ applies – whereas, grasses on other hand tolerate low CO2 and dry conditions very well, growing right up to the edges of deserts.
This change put a great deal of pressure on various forms of life, particularly on Africa’s primates, which were all forest dwellers and as a result of adaptation, mutation, selection and extinction of various species, a common ancestor emerged. A common ancestor to today’s three surviving species, i.e Humans, Chimpanzee and Bonobo.
Watch further.. on this fascinating presentation about, amongst others, a variety of environmentally negative outcomes such as human-induced extinctions, deforestation, soil erosion and desertification, hunter-gatherer influence, agricultural revolution/era, mass faunicide (1840CE), etc.
A brief history of the past twelve thousand (12,000) years with emphasis on the change to agriculture and city based civilisations.

"The writer of Proverbs wrote, ""Where there is no vision, the people perish (29:18). At Mount Olive it is our desire that you catch the vision God has given us that you begin to visualize the invisible. We have worked hard at defining our vision so that it is clear, challenging, and concise.
Mount Olive's Vision Statement
The vision of Mount Olive Baptist Church is to be a culturally relevant African American church that provides dynamic worship of God, while extending his transforming Grace to reach the unchurched community.
There are several key phrases that outline our vision:
Committed to Dynamic Worship
It is our vision to provide a worship service where the grace of God and broken humanity meet. It is our belief that sinful humanity needs an encounter with the divine. It is our intention to be a meeting place, where the hurting, the depressed, the frustrated, and the confused can find love, acceptance, help, hope, forgiveness, and encouragement through an authentic worship with inspiring music, dynamic preaching, powerful prayers and warm fellowship.
Transformation Through Christian Education
It is our vision to have every member of our congregation involved in ongoing Christian education learning. We believe that God calls us all to ""Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."" 1 Timothy 2:15. Therefore it is our vision to provide a wide variety of classes, workshops, seminars, retreats, and small groups that will facilitate the biblical, spiritual, and cultural growth and transformation of our members. For us, Christian education involves not only Bible classes, but may also involve Black History, parenting skills, economic development workshops, health seminars, financial planning etc. We are interested in ministering to the whole person.
Committed to Missions Around the Corner and Around the World
It is our vision to be doers as well as hearers of the word. As such, we are committed to being God's hands, God's feet and God's ears to suffering humanity wherever we find them. We will maintain an active Benevolence ministry that is open to all regardless of race, to provide help and hope. We take seriously the mandate to take the Gospel into all the world. We believe that our destiny is tied to the destiny of suffering people around the world. Therefore, it is our vision to support Global Missions in such a way that we not only preach the Gospel, but that we can actually be the Good News through providing schools, clinics, food, churches, etc.
Committed to Youth Empowerment
It is our vision to involve our youth in a transforming relationship with Jesus Christ at an early age. We believe that it is easier to build a boy or girl than it is to mend a man or a woman. Therefore, we are committed to ministry to youth. We are further committed to the education of our youth and have decided to give a substantial amount a year toward the continued education of our youth. Our vision is to make moral men and women out of our children. We want to have an exciting, relevant and dynamic ministry for youth that meets their spiritual, academic, cultural, and economic needs.
Committed to Adequate Space
It is our vision to provide space for the community to celebrate faith and life. We want to provide space for people to learn as wells as enjoy family and friends through dance and fellowship. We want to provide space for the young and old to experience relationships in a safe place that encourages new possibilities in church.",<urn:uuid:8135e295-6427-4078-a77f-87dac8b3632d>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.mountolivebaptist.org/aboutus/about_us,2024-02-20T22:29:15Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.956989049911499,719,1.3634812831878662,1

"Two, late great stars Dick Murdoch & Adrian Adonis Photo from WWE |
@kevinhunsperger & @my123cents on Twitter
Fans who watched wrestling in the mid to late 80's probably remember Adrian Adonis as the ""Adorable One"", prancing around the ring in a wig, dress, and make-up that would embarrass Tammy Faye Baker. But the fact of the matter is, Adonis was an accomplished superstar before the drastic change in gimmick.
My first memories of him were after he signed with the WWF and started teaming with Dick Murdoch. That duo beat the wildly popular Rocky Johnson and Tony Atlas for the tag team titles. I was stunned when it happened. Adonis had a tough New Yorker gimmick, which was carried over from his days in the AWA. He and Jesse Ventura were a successful tag team there. Even after he and Murdoch last the tag titles and Adonis disappeared for a while, he came back with Bobby Heenan as his manager. That gimmick didn't last long. Quite honestly it was a bit boring for the cartoonish, larger than life characters Adonis was competing with back then.
Here's a promo where Adonis ""comes out"". I don't think the WWF ever claimed Adonis was gay, but this particular video is filled with enough innuendo to imply it. As time went on, Adrian become more and more flamboyant.
""Adorable"" Adrian Photo by WWE |
Through the years Adrian packed on the pounds, but that didn't hide the fact that he was an accomplished wrestler. Adonis ended up on the losing end to Piper at Wrestlemania III and got his head shaved by Brutus Beefacke, hence the birth of the barber gimmick. It appeared that the two of them would feud next, but I'm guessing there were contract issues and Adonis ended up leaving the company. He headed back to the AWA, still holding on to the ""Adorable"" gimmick, and this time with Paul E. Dangerously as his manager.
It was a short run for Adonis as an injury basically forced him out of action. On July 4, 1988 he was getting back to wrestling when he was killed in a van accident with a group of other wrestlers in Canada. Dave McKigney and Pat Kelly also died that day.

"I’m starting to see overarching trends emerging in this lockdown period and I thought it might be useful to offer them up to a community of – our Mums (nobody reads this anymore, but those two probably forgot to unsubscribe). I know what you’re thinking – she’s going to do paint colour trends. Well, no. In the process of forgetting who I actually am, I’ve become more fixated on how to become a true Hermit instead.
Like a really good forecaster, Ros fled to an island last week to pursue this trend properly, but we can’t all have that foresight. So. To kick things off, your no-longer-roving reporter here in London can offer up some weekly steps on how to really allow yourself to let go into the Hermit lifestyle. From exactly where you are.
Full disclosure, I got a new job this week – I know, cool – as a home teacher. So I am only really following this dream outline in my head because of my new career. For me the below is all just “goals”. But I hope you can make it your reality.
Week 1: Letting the Hermit fantasy become a reality
Have you been harbouring a secret desire to become a bearded lady? Maybe you always wanted to see if it’s true that your pants start cleaning themselves when you keep wearing them? Wait, do I mean hair? Either way, if you are (optional dirt-loving) hermit-curious, this is your time to shine and find out if any or all of the above is possible.
Weigh up whether you really need to take that shower. Do you? Do you need to wash? I’m guessing the answer is no. Encourage your loved ones to live the same way so that nobody can smell anything beyond what’s coming off their own body. Begin to think about whether Skype is a good idea in this state and when you conclude that no, no it’s not. Give yourself a big pat on the back because you are half way to the hermit life.
Week 2: Reinvent yourself – painting and novel writing
Have you had an alternative creative career in mind? Maybe just a hobby you always meant to start? Don’t be bogged down by your perfect aspirations and try for just good enough. If your writer’s platform is Whatsapp, then so be it. Make a day of it. Choose one friend as your audience and then really go for it with the constant messaging. You’re both going to get something out of this. Exactly what, will be revealed to you at the end of the isolation period when you’re in touch irl again. Or not.
Don’t have an easel? OK then, get your iphone out – ha ha, I know, it’s already out – and point it at things like your dead herbs or a petal lying abandoned on the floor. Voila. Send it to all your friends and put it on Instagram exclaiming ‘look what I created’ or ‘the beauty of nature’. Actually, IG is not really meant to be part of the Hermit lifestyle so just put it on a wall instead. Even if that wall is your mind and the photo is but a moment you dreamt up.
Coming up next: We’ll be covering whittling skills, cooking over stones, what happens when you think the tv started watching you, and growing your own veg from a window sill.",<urn:uuid:78e1b7db-132f-4789-bd98-46109d65dcb1>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.myfriendshouse.co.uk/hermits-handbook/,2024-02-20T23:09:10Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9471724629402161,750,0.919955313205719,1

"As part of the recent Cheshire Oaks Food and Drink Festival we were kindly invited to an exclusive interview with celebrity chef Simon Rimmer. The weekend festival included various short food demonstrations by Simon and Stacie Stewart, who headlined the cookery theatre to demonstrate how shoppers can create delicious home-cooked delights. Alongside were a variety of stalls featuring a number of local artisan suppliers with products ranging from pies, sausages and chutneys to cakes, fudge and other sweet treats.
Are there any plans to open a restaurant in Liverpool?
the Elephant pub in Woolton which I bought at the end of December. So we took
that over and have massive plans, we were going to refurbish it in February but
then we had a couple issues with planning. We wanted to make sure the locals
like what we do. The danger is, you don’t know the area, and we really wanted
to involve the locals. We have done a lot of tastings with them and we have even
shown our regular customers the swatches of fabric that we are going to use. It
has been great really nice process. We will open the doors in August. Everyone
is excited. It will be a big change in there but it would still hopefully feel
like the Elephant of old.
What type of food will you be serving?
food is going to be really good pub food. We are going to make everything on site,
adding interesting little twists. For our sausages and mash, we are using
hickory smoked sausage and we are doing it on patatas bravas, We are also doing
a curry, but rather than doing a straight forward curry we are doing a pulled
lamb vindaloo with buttered almond rice, coriander and mint yoghurt chutney.
Again we are not re-inventing the wheel but we are putting my take on it. The
restaurant is going to be a modern American brasserie, again everything is made
on-site. Good simple food but with an American kind of feel to it. The decor is
almost themed, you won’t feel like walking into a TGI Fridays, we have put a
lot of research into it, Southern United States, Texas, New York, a lot of it
coming out of the States, I find it really exciting now these days, so we are
using that as our starting point.
Where are you going to source the produce from?
local as we can, we are going to use Bexters as our butchers, just Liverpool
based, a macaron shop in Wavertree, Liverpool Cheese Company just 50 yards down
the road in Woolton, sausages are made by Scotch Beef Shop butchers, which is
again in Woolton village. The famous Blackstick Blue, that I was part of the
develop team off when it first came out. So we are using as many local produce
as we can.
So what demonstrations will you be doing today?
doing a series of quick demos, when you do demos in a shopping centre its usually
small fifteen minute sessions to keep peoples interest. Whereas at food festivals
then maybe forty five minutes, Forty
five minute demos are too long. I see people getting really disinterested, I
see people thinking I got to buy them shoes!
demos today will include meatballs in a bloody mary sauce, I do pork and beef
meatballs in a proper Italian American way. A lot of meatballs in this country
are in a ball, so it is just meat that is fried so as a result you get just the
tightness, meatballs were created to extend the amount of meat you eat. It is a
essentially a peasant dish so meatballs should have loads of bread in them,
bread mixed in with the meat to extends as a result you should get, if you do
it properly, it should be nice and silky in the middle.
nicoise salad, I will scorch the salmon just on one side. First I will take a piece
of salmon and cut it into four slices, then into a really hot pan, literally
lay it on the pan, take it out, let it heat on one side, so it crisps on one
side and cooks on the other. So you almost get crispy and soft at the same time,
one side it’s like smoked salmon, so you get that really nice texture and then
chocolate roulade and we are lining it with nutella, which is a good filthy dirty
Are you a hands-on type of chef? Can you be often be found
in your restaurants at Earle and Greens?
but not this year since we bought the Elephant, not as many nights as I did,
purely for practical reasons. Now, in Liverpool I am developing the new stuff,
training the staff and over in Greens, I am still there creating all of the
dishes but at the end of the day, I have been doing this for 25 years. I have
great people and the business are at a size as it is now, in many respects it
is impractical to run the business during the daytime and stand behind the
stove for another 8 hours at the end of it, I’m knackered! If I had only one
site then yes you can still find me in the kitchen all the time on site all the
time but now you find me in each of the sites, maybe one day a week as opposed
to five or six.
are a bit ashamed to admit being foodies we haven’t had chance to visit Greens or Earle yet! Can you tell us a bit about the philosophy of the food?
started Greens twenty five years ago. From a business point of view, a lot of
customers are meat eaters and we wanted to do something for Vegetarians. It
appeals obviously to veggies but it is an interesting way of food. The food is
created is inspired by South Asian, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern cuisines etc.
We want to do steak and chips, but we can’t do steak, so its how we replace
that piece of meat in the dish yet keeping it interesting.
What is your favourite restaurant?
that’s a tricky one. It’s funny because it changes all the time. The busier I
get, the more creative my point of view has to be, the more hats I have to wear
with all of the businesses. It changes
at different times. At the moment, it is a bar just round the corner from my
house, The Font, good beer and decent food. Because I am too busy if I can just
walk round the corner I am dead happy. If I was going to recommend somewhere, I
love Camp and Furnace in Liverpool, the food Slam Friday they do, the whole ethos
behind food is good. Low level street food, in terms of expenditure, but in a
very exciting way, I love it in there. London Carriage Works, by Paul Askew in
Liverpool and in Manchester, I like Mr Coopers. Also Aiden Byrne is my mate at
Manchester House, I think what he is doing is very creative although I have to
be in the mood for it to be honest. I also like East Z East is good for a curry
How about in London?
in London at least two days every week. The interesting things in London, you
see trends, I think Polpetto is fantastic in Soho. Equally, pizza which doesn’t
have to be boring, it can be funky. I love Pollen Street Social and Berners
Tavern is fantastic and incredible! If you want to be somewhere and just be
blown away by the décor then that would be it, you walk in and think Oh My God!
It feels like as a kid, when you first go into a restaurant, for me I remember it’s
out of this world. It is just incredible.
What are your views on food bloggers? Are they good or bad
for the industry?
really. Downside, it is very easy to be negative, easy to be smug. Oh that
wasn’t very good; oh I didn’t really like that. There are good and bad points
on any form of social media and online critiquing. Because at the end of the
day, what gives you the right to think my opinion is better than yours, that’s
the downside to it. At what point does a punter cross the line? Are you
restaurant customers and do you want to write about your experience or what do
you aim for? There are certain people who use it as a form of blagging which is
one of the negative points. Some food bloggers in London, it seems like to get
recognised, and use it as a means for eating for free bloggers, that calls the integrity
into question. I think there are some great blogs who uncover little gems are
great. I don’t think bloggers should blog big established restaurants by unearth
new undiscovered gems for more of a buzz. However on the main they are good for
the industry, the more and more people that do get involved with good food, the
Do you read the blogs about your restaurant?
is the only one that we monitor; the only critical side about Tripadvisor is it
seems like a negative place. I had someone complain, they gave us a two star
rating on Tripadvisor because it was his birthday but he didn’t get a free glass
champagne. There are so many sites to look at surrounding food and drink. Some
who are have built up a huge following and are powerful tools. There is a
danger with them, if they believe their hype a bit too much, then there are times
their journalism can put you in the wrong light.
Being a red have you had an opportunity to cook for the team?
Yeah being in the public eye I have had the chance to
collaborate with many legends and people from the club. As part of Kenny
Daglish’s birthday and for his charity me and Kenny cooked in the kitchen. A
few of the players have been in my restaurants as well as Brendan Rodgers.
Although I was disappointed that he chose a well done steak! In fact I am going with the team to New York
in July for preseason.
What is your favourite type of cuisine?
Again it changes all the time, at the moment I love slow
cooking, pulled pork and slow cooked meats. Ultimately, if it was down to my
last supper then I will probably go for an Indian curry. I taught myself how to
make proper char sui, I kind of got obsessive with that for a while, little
things I will start to get obsessed with and go through phases.
of the biggest single influences on my cooking is Thai, my best mate lives in
Thailand and the first time I went over there I had done a little bit of Thai
cooking. I spent a day cooking with his
housekeeper and I think that was the most valuable single day that I have ever
had in my entire career. Just learning from somebody who is not a professional or
restaurant chef and watching the way she did things, her knowledge of flavours",<urn:uuid:f81612fb-0121-4dbc-b5fc-6d1456f1904c>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.nomface.co.uk/2014/07/exclusive-interview-with-simon-rimmer.html,2024-02-20T21:56:36Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9776370525360107,2398,0.7091054916381836,1

"Gambler Denied €43 Million Slots Jackpot To Sue Casino
December 14, 2011 12:34 pmA Swiss gambler who though he had won a casino’s slots jackpot for €43 million ($62 million) only to be informed it was a “software error,” is now suing the casino with the first hearing scheduled for January 10th.
Behar Merlaku, 26, is a Kosovar-Albanian who fled his homeland during the Balkans war and settled in Switzerland. On the 26th March, 2011, he was playing the slot machine at Bregenz Casino in Austria, when he got the surprise of his life. As he explains:
“The jackpot came up loud and clear. There was music and the sum I had won, nearly 43 million euros, was displayed on a screen. I was so overjoyed and in my head I began calculating what I could do with all this money.”
However, his joy was short-lived after the casino staff pointed out that he had only hit four of the five required symbols in a line and informed him that the jackpot display was caused by a ‘software error.
Mr Merlaku was then offered a free meal and £60 by way of compensation, which he chose to refuse, and has been demanding that the casino honours the ‘win’ ever since. Describing the trauma he has suffered as a result of the incident, Merlaku said:
“I have psychological problems since the jackpot incident. I can’t sleep anymore and I constantly think about the injustice I’ve experienced. I’m almost ruined. I’ll always keep thinking about that day.”
In addition, after he refused the Bregenz Casino’s paltry offer for compensation, he was subsequently banned from the premises with the casino placing responsibility for the incident squarely on the shoulders of the slots manufacturer.
The first hearing in the case is now scheduled for January 10, 2011.",<urn:uuid:20aa33cf-b83e-44fd-a978-f052aad8c1d2>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.onlinepoker.net/poker-news/casino-news/gambler-denied-43-million-slots-jackpot-sue-casino/13397,2024-02-20T22:21:07Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.986057460308075,424,0.6657306551933289,1
"What do private investigators say are the most common signs of a cheating spouse?
When you suspect infidelity in your relationship it can be difficult to determine whether or not your suspicions are valid and if so, what to do next. At PInow, we surveyed our network of trusted infidelity investigators to find out what, in their experience, are the common indications of infidelity in a relationship. The following graphic displays the six major signs of a cheating spouse, what to expect in an infidelity investigation and other statistics on infidelity and marriage.
And the 6 common signs of a cheating spouse are …
1. Changes in Intimacy 2. Suspicious Phone Habits 3. Changes in Appearance 4. Suspicious Internet Use 5. Changes in Work Routine 6. Changes in Bathing Habits
Other signs included concealing credit card statements or having bills mailed to a P.O. box, finding strange receipts, going out or running long errands without the spouse, flirting with friends of the opposite sex and a change in overall attitude. Infidelity investigations can cost anywhere from $500 to $5,000 and last anywhere from 4 hours to 6 months. Most investigators said their investigations verify infidelity 75-100% of the time. Other statistics show that when spouses cheat, 55% of the time it’s the husband while 45% of the time it’s the wife. 30-60% of married people will cheat on their spouse according to a range that compensates for dishonesty among study participants. 74% of husbands and 68% of wives say they would have an affair if they knew they wouldn’t get caught. 85% of wives who suspect their husbands are cheating are correct 85% of the time, while husbands who suspect their wives are cheating are correct 50% of the time. Marriage statistics were provided by the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, Indiana University, Business Week, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal",<urn:uuid:b334b857-19d6-4f14-aa5d-fcc7801188fc>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.onqpi.com/blog/signs-of-a-cheating-spouse,2024-02-20T21:29:26Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9513113498687744,401,1.0656073093414307,1

"Though I don't scrawl upon my own blog, I still visit others' from time to time. Time to rare time. I read Rookie (which, incidentally, has a whole new look that I'm immensely proud of), I read my mom, I read Rabid, I read Ranger, and Winder and Bird and a smattering of others. (I'd say that I read Cat, but she posts, like, every third blue moon, and when she posts it's not about her--its about other people--so that doesn't count. And I'd say I read private blogs, but that requires rememberin' and I don't do that so good these days.) But that's about it. That's about all I read. At least those are the ones I can recall right now.
However, every so often I land on another blog--some food blog Whit forwarded me or another someone I used to check in on--and some of these blogs display a button or a credo proclaiming that they are ad-free and ding damn proud of it. I have returned today in part to tell you how stupid that is.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with putting ads on your blog. Nothing wrong with making money from advertising on the space you maintain on el Internet. Why? Because blogging takes time. It takes time away from other things. And if you're blogging regularly there's a chance that you've developed a following--large or small--and that following returns because they are entertained. Whether it be out of delight, fury, or incredulity, they keep coming back to lap up what you leave behind. The stuff you left that took time to create. And when you put ads on your blog you are being remunerated for that time. A little reward for the words you send worldwide. Blogging doesn't have to be a perpetual act of service for your readers.
Why in the world would someone be proud to run an ad free blog? You're proud that you spend hours and hours over the course of time maintaining your blog for free? If that's what you want, fine. Go for it. But don't look down on or decry those who make a buck or two doing the same kind of thing you're slaving at without fiscal yield. In my opinion, they're going about things more efficiently than you are; they're maximizing their time by earning money. It's just good sense is all.
Am I saying that everyone should put ads on their blogs? That if you don't make money off of your blog you're a moron? Of course not. Plenty of people blog for their own entertainment or for posterity or for friends or for . . . or for . . . or for . . . The reasons are many and individual. If what you get in return for your hours blogging is something intangible, something intrinsic, and that's enough, then, well, that's enough. But you're pathetic if you are one who gets enough from your blog without being paid and you boast about it.
I'm ad-free! No kidding. I'm on your blog right now and I don't see any ads. And from that I assume that you don't want any and that means that you are presently fulfilling your blogging goals. Your blog in its present state sates you. Perhaps next month you're going to start feeling that you want more from your blog and you consider joining an ad network. The next time I land on your blog I see that there's an ad, and from that I understand that you have a new goal for your blog and the ad's going to help fulfill it. It's that simple. Proclaiming your ad-free-ness is redundant and self-important.
While I'm here, why not a little update? Let's see . . . What have I been up to since we last cavorted?
• I got a new drug. One to sell, not to take. And it's been a really intense study. I'm not kidding: there was a span when every night I'd see ECGs in my sleep.
• I've added regular Bikram yoga classes as a supplement to my usual power practice. I do power yoga the first half of the week and then Bikram on the weekend. Bikram and power are night-and-day different, but I've found that they compliment each other in maximizing the role in my life that I've defined for yoga.
• I applied to seven graduate school programs. (Yes, seven. Terrified that any writing skill I thought I once possessed had been a casualty of my post-graduation intellectual atrophy, I figured that some law of large numbers had to be in my favor and at least one school would take pity on me and let me in.) When I graduated from college 100 years ago (okay just 8 years ago, but it feels much longer) my plan was to head right into a Masters program. Hah. Life happened. Higher education didn't. I've bitched and pined ever since. Now's the time to stop the bemoaning and hop on it already.
My program of choice: a low-residency MFA in Creative Nonfiction. Not the most common of programs, trust-you-me. Low-residency means that I can apply anywhere and still live here. I spend a ten day residency on campus at the beginning of each semester and then carry out the rest of the coursework long-distance. That works for a writing program.
I decided to do the applying at the beginning of December and needed to have all the applications in the mail by February 15th. I'm telling you, it was a superhuman feat to learn my new drug and get my applications off on time, 'specially since the manuscripts required ranged from 20-40 pages and there were personal essays to write as well. But I did it and lived to tell the tale.
I am immensely grateful for the friends and sisters that read for me while I was in the editing and retooling phases. Without them, I'd never have been able to send off stuff to be proud of.
I've heard back from two schools so far. Both said Yes.
• I did the Rookie redesign. I hated Whitney's blog. It was ugly. She liked it fine, but I, the supposed designer, did not. So I told her it was time for Rookie Cookie to grow up and get a new look. And it did. And I like. For now.
Going back and redoing all the food pictures will take 37 million years, but I hate so very, very, very much the font that I initially chose such that it will be worth all the time it takes. Whenever I finally get around to doing it, that is.
• I've just embarked on working on a blog for my mom's book. Oh yes, friends and neighbors, my mom wrote a book. A whole book! It's called The Mourning Run and it's based on a true story and it will have a blog to go with it.
(I realize that linking to the blog is premature (hope that doesn't bug you, Ma), but it's a work in progress and you should know its location. When it's done, it's going to be a great resource for those who grieve. I'll absolutely let you know when the book is in print--a couple months, we're thinking. It will be a great gift for anyone who is mourning. I already have a couple people I'm eager to send the book to. The blog will complement the book. There is much to explain regarding that, and, as I said, it's a work in progress; to understand, you'll just have to go there when it's done. I'll yell and scream when that time comes.)
• The Soph is well. Perfect, basically. Mom, Mal, and Lo came to visit and brought Dash (Mal's Boxer puppy), Gus (my parents' Westie), and Miles (my dad's Christmas present--a miniature Schnauzer puppy), and my chubby Yorkie lived to tell the tale. Yes, of course she knows how to speak. I said she's perfect.
• The Husband is well as well. He is still a denim snob. (You didn't know he is a denim snob? Oh, he is. My sisters Caitlyn and Mal turned him into a first-rate premium denim whore. I don't tell him when the jeans I'm wearing are from Forever 21--not that he can't just tell by looking.) He is still at Apple. He is still tall. And dark haired with a smattering of grey strays that I find attractive. And nice to me. And aching to see Caitlyn pregnant.

Outcomes We present that 2PAP alone will not remove contaminating endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membrane completely. However a book combination of thickness gradient centrifugation plus 2PAP leads to a solid PM preparation. To show the utility of the technique we isolated PM from journey heads and effectively discovered 432 proteins using MudPIT which 37% are essential membrane proteins from all compartments. From the 432 proteins 22 have already been previously assigned towards the PM area and an additional 34% are unassigned to any area and represent applicants for assignment towards the PM. The rest have previous tasks to various other compartments. Conclusion A combined mix of thickness gradient centrifugation and 2PAP leads to a solid high purity PM planning from Drosophila something neither technique can perform alone. This novel planning should place the groundwork for the proteomic analysis from the PM in various hereditary backgrounds in Drosophila. Our outcomes also recognize NMS-873 two key guidelines in this process: The marketing of membrane partitioning in the PEG/Dextran mix and careful selection of the right lectin for the affinity purification part of light of variants in mass membrane lipid structure and glycosylation patterns respectively. This true points just how for even more adaptations into other systems. History The plasma membrane (PM) and its own associated protein play a significant role in identifying what sort of cell interacts using its neighbours aswell as how it responds to the different parts of and circumstances in its extracellular environment. Being a reflection of the a lot more than 50% of the existing drug targets NMS-873 rest on the cell surface area .

Hence it is vital to develop methods that let the effective research of the top pool specifically. The task for isolation from the PM NMS-873 is certainly its low plethora – 10% or much less of the mobile membrane with regards to the tissues type – that’s conveniently overwhelmed by high plethora compartments like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Several ways to isolate plasma membranes can be found and each provides its weaknesses and strengths. Thickness gradient centrifugation separates organelles and biomolecules based on their buoyant densities. Although this leads to fractionation commonalities in membrane thickness inevitably result in an overlap between mobile compartments (analyzed in ). Immunoaffinity purification using antibodies against cell surface area proteins continues to be utilized to isolate plasma membranes from rat liver organ  and mouse livers with fairly low contaminants from various other compartments . Nevertheless this method depends upon the option of an excellent antibody to an individual proteins and is hence apt to be tissues particular and biased towards a particular PM area in polarized cells. Global surface area labeling with biotin and isolation of biotinylated surface area proteins by using streptavidin continues to be utilized before (analyzed in ). Financial firms not really a practical way of plasma membrane isolation from a complete organism or NMS-873 organ. Lately aqueous two-phase affinity partitioning (2PAP) provides emerged as a good strategy to isolate plasma membranes from many resources [7-11]. In this technique plasma NMS-873 membrane is certainly first partitioned in to the polyethylene glycol (PEG) level of the two-phase PEG/Dex program then selectively taken in to the dextran stage through the lectin whole wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) combined towards the dextran to choose for membrane formulated with glycosylated proteins.

"Custom Christening Gown~ A Sweet Dress for a very Sweet Baby
Among my favorite design projects are creating Christening gowns for babies. I have done a half dozen over the past year, and each one brought a great amount of satisfaction. Like birthdays, communions, and weddings, Baptisms bring great joy to families. Parents plan the day, the ceremony, the outfit, the celebration. So much goes into the process, and in the end, there are many wonderful memories to hold on to the moments.A mother and daughter, Laura (Mom) and LouAnn (Grandma), came to consult with me on making a Christening gown for Laura's infant daughter. The baby's gown was going to be made out of LouAnn's wedding dress, which was almost 38 years old. The dress had been preserved and boxed, and had been stored away in her attic. Upon opening the box, this vintage dress was in amazing condition. The fabric had aged only a tiny bit, and with the exceptions of the cloth buttons, not much had yellowed. The dress was beautiful, it had been custom made for LouAnn's wedding day . There was lots of lace and beading, a button down back, and a veil that was to die for with lace flowers, beading, and crystals.
I love vintage fabrics and embellishments!
Bride and dress ~absolutely stunning.. |
Laura was very laid back regarding the design of the dress. She didn't want anything over the top, nothing too long. Just something simple, and elegant. She gave me carte blanche over the design, and I was truly excited to begin.
Here is my creation...
Gown, bonnet, and lace handkerchief |
Gown front and bonnet detail |
Bonnet detail~ this lace was just gorgeous! |
Tiny buttons down her back...beaded flowers too! |
Back close up detail...
You can't have a gown without slippers! |
LouAnn married Warren August 14, 1976 and now her granddaughter is Baptised almost 38 years later in her remade vintage gown... how sweet is this?
Laura and LouAnn~ Thank you for trusting me to create her gown. I loved designing it for you. You are such lovely women, and I have been blessed to have worked with you both. The baby is so precious, thank you for bringing her to meet me. I hope you and your family have a beautiful day!P.S. LouAnn~ I didn't have the heart to cut that veil.

"MOULTON-Lawrence County authorities tell ShoalsInsider.com have charged two Florence men with Trafficking heroin and possession of methamphetamine or what it is more commonly known as “Ice”.
According to Lawrence County Sheriff Gene Mitchell, Gregory Lee Riley, 47, of 413 Roxie Drive, and Dale Alan Kujath, 49, of 1004 Sherrod Avenue, both of Florence, were each charged with drug trafficking, possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia.
Mitchell says the arrests came as a result of a routine traffic stop along Hwy. 157 in Lawrence County.
A drug dog was called in and indicated there were drugs located in the car. The large cache of heroin (17 grams) was found in the passenger and driver door panels. A smaller amount of meth (4 grams) was found, along with drug paraphernalia.
According to Michell, Riley, who was driving the vehicle, refused to give consent to search the automobile. Agents then obtained a search warrant to search for drugs.
Drug agents believe Kujath and Riley were purchasing heroin and meth in Birmingham to sell in the Shoals area.
The two men are being held in the Lawrence County Detention Center on $55,000 bail.

"The “Dude”, handy guy that he is, put the bike together perfectly in no time flat. A couple runs up and down the street and we had the fit dialed in just right. Rode down to the nearby elementary school soccer field and I did a few hot laps to try it out.
Shockingly fast, light, stiff and incredibly nimble through turns. I did a few figure eights in the grass, and immediately fell deeply in love with it. And those Disc brakes…
A few other first impressions:
Great geometry. I really love the solid, steady feel of the bike. It’s an interesting mixture of lightness and stiffness combined with a really rock solid feel.
It’s quick handling, but not twitchy by any means, so it goes where you want, when you want, how you want. Love that.
It’s fast. The overall stiffness of the bike translates into quick acceleration. It’s gonna be fun to race this bike.
The looks. Beautifully understated. Up close, the frame finish is a gorgeous soft charcoal with some really pretty gradations of gray/silver along the top tube. From far away, it just looks incredibly BADASS.
The ride. Smooth, forgiving, and easy on bumpy terrain. My old bike tended to jar my fillings loose tearing across a bumpy dry CX course, so by the end of the race, I’d feel like I had been beaten up. This smoother ride is going to be great and probably more efficient in the long run–leaving me a little more energy for those last few laps.
And the brakes. The new disc brakes are awesome and will be fantastic in a muddy, wet CX race! A stroke of genius allowing those on a cyclocross bike. Makes it that much more of an all-around great bike.
I even like the stock tires that came on it. They grip uneven surfaces nicely but roll smoothly and easily. Great tires for virtually everything.
But the best way to test out the new Auger…a cyclocross race.
Now it’s not cyclocross season, but it just so happens that Ballwin Days puts on a heckofa fun CX race in the middle of June. It’s a great course–hilly and bumpy, with two sand volleyball pits, a LONG stair run up, some asphalt, some curbs, and tons of really steep, off-camber hills. Not a dull moment, that’s for sure.
I signed up and entered the ‘A’ race, which according to the registration guidelines was for “racers.” However, when I rolled up to the start line, it was me and a bunch of really fast mountain bikers. Ten laps, as opposed to the 5 for the ‘B’ race. Ouch.
Not sure why I like CX so much. I just do.
Maybe it’s that feeling of being totally redlined most of the race, that ‘survival-of-the-fittest’ feeling that you have to go as if your life depends on it. I dunno…I always feel like I’m gonna puke and die about the third lap of every race, but by the 5th lap or so, my heart has finally caught up, I’m breathing in O2 and I’m in the Zone. And when you get done, it’s a buzz like nothing else. (Or is that the post-race beer?)
I was delighted with the Auger’s ability to fly through the sand pits. We are talking about some deep, loose sand here. I hit both sand pits at the highest speed possible without wiping out, and found that the bike floated through on those nice fat tires until I got nearly to the other side. Then it was either pedal hard (weight off the handlebars-thank you, Alison Powers) or steer over to grab a little bit of grass for traction, and it was right on through. Love it.
My slowest spot was the curb back up onto the course after the front straightaway. I can do a decent bunny hop, but not having been on the new bike long, and not being totally used to it, I opted to go the safe route and put a foot out to get over. That slowed me down a little, especially with the guys who had mountain bikes and were just easily hopping over that obstacle.
And you just cannot see how long and steep this hill was, but it was one of those you look at and wonder how the hell you’re gonna make it up there… The Auger carried me through this turn like a champ. Well, except for that second to last lap, when my legs started turning to Jello and my back tire slipped on the very last hard pedal stroke before the turn. Crap. But, one foot down and around and I was back in the game.
The steep off camber hills were no big deal, and actually quite fun. I liked testing the limits of how fast I could go along the edges of those hills and make the turns. The Auger carried me through all of it with ease.
In my fuzzy oxygen deprived state I had a funny realization that I was going steadily uphill at least half of the race, but the uphill sections really felt no different than the level parts of the race course. This bike loves hills! Thank God for that.
Race over, I lived through it, and I did a pretty decent job. The Auger was fantastic. No question about it’s race-worthiness.
And if I were purchasing a new CX bike, this would certainly be at the top of the list. No question about it.
How many more days until CX season starts? Bring on the rain and snow and foul weather. I cannot wait.
We are off to the Farmer’s Market today, my Auger and I.",<urn:uuid:6d831c48-702f-46e8-898b-f3c60afbd07f>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.simplesmartnutrition.com/tag/cyclocross,2024-02-20T22:38:28Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9707732796669006,1256,0.8003565073013306,1
"That's so much better than I remember their LBs being in the past! That hat is a snap-back, right? And I'm with Andy on wanting to see that Snoopy - actually, everything!
That's a great bag, especially if you are into astroboy. Glad to see SB doing the bags right. Which size was this?
Yep, 9FIFTY snapback. I purchased the Good Choice III—that was the highest tier available. Here's shots of everything minus the Mickey Mouse tote bag (which can be seen on their website HERE). The Rat Fink rug was also part of the contents. I haven't kept track of all the releases so I'm not sure if the middle scale Astro Boy with the SB shirt is new or exclusive to these boxes. Either way, I'd yet to add one to my collection so really happy one was included.
Thanks for sharing @HBCoffin! Glad to see you were right about the big AB and that your gamble paid off
Wow. Killer bag. That full size Astro Boy is the best version yet IMO. The rug is awesome. The Snoopy toy is much cooler than I was expecting it to be. Congrats @HBCoffin
Thanks everyone! Of course I'm thrilled about the Big Scale Astro Boy, but really happy with just about everything I got. The rug was completely unexpected and one of the most exciting things to find as I had been debating picking up another novelty rug for my office a few weeks ago. Glad I held off! The Snoopy is not something I would have purchased on its own but is pretty rad. Had to heat up the vinyl to get Snoopy out of his packaging and reinserted but it softened up quick and easy. Friction and weight are enough to keep it from sliding off the base. Will try to get better shots of the figures and Astro's new innards when I have some free time to spare.

"But I tell you, every time as a reporter I talked to Nick Aliotti, I got TV gold. That quote above was actually one of the more mundane things I ever got him saying on camera. He told you what he was thinking and that stood out above any coaching things he ever did. He acted more like a fan than any Oregon coach I've been around. He called Oregon State “little brother.” After a tense game once he asked for beer. I still remember when some guys got suspended from the team (for what I don't remember) and Chip and Helfrich (who was still the offensive coordinator at the time) were a bit reticent in their media appearances. Well, Aliotti came out and said exactly what we wanted to hear. It wasn't anything earth-shattering, but it was what somebody needed to say: that it was a dumb decision, that kids can't be doing whatever it was they did, that they need to learn from their mistakes if they want to be back on the team, and that he's going to do his best to make sure it doesn't happen again. And Aliotti got quoted in every media outlet saying that, because he was the one who spoke out.
It makes me almost think that it was calculated by the team to let Aliotti be the front man. As a gruff, quotable guy who gave the impression he could take the heat, I wouldn't be surprised if coming out of those practices the coaches would decide who would say the quotable stuff. Especially when Chip was around. I imagine Helfrich might be a little more slack in that regard. But I can totally imagine Chip going “Nick, it's Civil War week and I'm going to praise everybody, you say whatever the hell you want.”
Now, he really can. Save travels, Coach Aliotti.
Of course he's not the only coach in his final game on Monday. Mack Brown will be done at Texas after this as well, after he resigned/got pushed out/avoided being fired/decided he was done with it. I find it funny that Oregon's pushing the whole “the Alamo Bowl is a sellout, see we do travel well” argument. When the fact that San Antonio is 90 miles away from Burnt Orange HQ in Austin and there's probably a pretty big contingent of Texas fans wanting to see Mack on the sidelines one more time.
The more I think about it, the more Mack Brown and Nick Aliotti's paths in their final season has been similar. Both long-standing, respected coaches who probably just got tired of the grind. They have other things to do. They see all the health issues popping up with coaches who are younger than they are. Most likely, they heard the complaints, the same complaints they've heard for years, and finally pulled a Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon. Brown will coach again, and soon, but likely at a smaller school. Aliotti? He could come back. Never say never. I imagine he takes at least a year off, though.
Anyway, because San Antonio is so close to Austin and this is Texas' second straight appearance in the game, (having beaten Oregon State last year) this is pretty close to qualifying as a non-bowl game as far as MSC's are concerned. But when you look at Alamo Bowl records and see that the four previous top attendance marks at this game involved a team from Texas (the Longhorns and Aggies), and two of those games are in the top five of Alamodome crowds, period, well, it makes sense, doesn't it? The bowl delivers what it promises. It's usually wildly entertaining. Remember RGIII when he was good, and the highest scoring bowl game in history?
As for the game itself, well, I'm picking Oregon but I have a few things to watch for. One, the Oregon players were complaining about the possibility of going back to the Rose Bowl (because they'd “been there, done that,”) even before they got mashed by Arizona. Then they looked out of sorts even as they had a tremendous finish against Oregon State in the Civil War. So how are they coming into this game? If the Rose Bowl would have been a letdown, what's getting passed over for the Sugar Bowl by an unworthy Oklahoma team do to your motivation going to San Antonio?
Then you've got the Texas factor. I bet it's 70-30 Longhorn fans vs Oregon fans. Oregon State should have beaten the Longhorns last year but I think the Texas factor made a difference. Oregon has shown that they struggle on the road against good teams- Stanford and Arizona being the example- and the Ducks are the a road team against a good team. Texas isn't even close to as good as Stanford, but are they better than Arizona? They might be.
So here's where we find out what kind of team Oregon is in the Mark Helfrich era. I want to know if the Arizona game was a speed bump or an indication of what to expect. We will find out Monday. And then, we'll find out who they get to replace Nick Aliotti. Well, replace isn't the right word. I'm reminded of what Thomas Jefferson said when he arrived in Paris as the American Ambassador, taking over for Ben Franklin, who charmed the French to no end.
They said, “Are you here to replace Franklin?”
And Jefferson said, to modernize the lingo, “No one can replace Ben Franklin. I'm just the next man up.”
To the next man up after Nick Aliotti, you'd be wise to remember that.

"I have started to work on my angora gloves using the i-cord fingers recipe given by Nona Knits. I am really amazed at how simple the principles of knitting a finger are. I started last night and I already have three fingers.
I have labelled the fingers, as recommended by Nona. I can see the point in marking each finger as it is bound to get confusing. I have also seen on the Ravelry Pattern Page that several people have lost their fingers before knitting up the gloves, so I have made sure that they are put safely away in a project bag, with the yarn. I don't to have to knit the gloves twice.
I was right about the yumminess of this yarn. Already the gloves are feeling so soft and snuggly, that I know when they are finished, the gloves will feel amazing. I love the fact that there will be no seams on the fingers. So far this recipe seems to be working out just fine.
With the success of one recipe, I thought I would try another recipe. A few months ago, I started to cast on some socks based on a set of instructions. These socks got abandoned despite my initial good intentions. I have no excuse other than the overwhelming amount of gorgeous yarn I got my mitts on. I frogged the socks and put them on hold. I have now dug out the very first yarn I bought online, and tried again with the instructions. These socks will be more winter appropriate than the ones I frogged as the yarn in nice and thick. These socks will also be plain and simple stocking stitch so I can gauge whether these instructions work. I have swatched up the yarn, and decided that as my foot and ankle do not match, unlike the instructions, I am going to have to jiggle the pattern a little.
I started with a 3mm circular needle and cast on 70 stitches. I then knit 1x1 ribbing for 1.5"". Then on the next round I carried on ribbing for 15 stitches and then 3Ptog. I did this another 3 times, which reduced my stitch count down to 58. This reduction is fairly invisible in the ribbing. I have coloured the 3Ptog on this photo. The smaller amount of stitches is at the top of the photo.
After the reduction, I ribbed another 0.5""and then started to knit all the stitches. This has now brought the measurements being used, at the ankle, in line with those laid out in the pattern, i.e. the same width as my foot, less 0.75"". I am hoping that the rest of the pattern will work out without any more jiggling. This is what I have so far.
Once I have done the whole sock I will type up the pattern and keep it for future use. I am sure no-one else will want it, because no-one else will have the same feet and fat ankles as me! I still think it is a good idea to write it up, simply for future use, because I really, really want to knit lots of socks.
Edited to Add several hours later......
GAhhhh my maths sucks. My reducing down from 70 to 58 was so totally wrong, I started again. I have now worked out what I hope will work. I will let you know.....",<urn:uuid:5d7ac517-7d54-4236-999f-a3447a42dfc2>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.stitchedtogether.co.uk/2009/01/knitting-recipes.html,2024-02-20T23:20:40Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9725044369697571,688,0.9237333536148071,1
"Anyway back to my original point. I haven't been blogging much because my health is not great at the moment. Someone at my surgery decided that as they couldn't find explicit instruction in clear language in my notes about why I should be taking a certain medication, which I've taken for several years, I needed to be referred back to a Consultant. They did not refer my back to my original Consultant who I saw for nearly 10 years, but to a stranger. So for 6 months I have had my meds messed about with and as a result my hormones have been all over the place and my endometriosis has been kicking my butt. Six months down the line and I am back on my original meds and my hormones are still not stabilising. I feel RUBBISH and as a result I've not been blogging as much.
I think my blogging has taken a back seat as I didn't have any energy to take pretty pictures, nor the brain power to write lucidly! I've always subscribed to the school of thought that if you can't do something well, then don't do it at all. It's a stupid way of doing things, especially if you are ill. If I stuck to it rigidly I'd never do anything and all my crafting would never have got started, because no one can do anything perfectly at the first attempt. So this blog post is just for me. It is to remind me that just because it's not perfect I can still write a blog post, especially as there are things I want to tell you about.
I finished knitting Melia!!! It is gorgeous, but it isn't blocked yet, and it might not be for a couple of weeks, because of health issues. I haven't sewn in the pockets yet as I want to block it first. When it is blocked, the pockets sewn in and a zipper added I will take some photos and I will blog about it properly, but I just wanted to crow in triumph that the first CTM and KTQ2013 project is pretty much finished.
As I have finished my first CTM project, it was time to start the second one. I dived into box number 2 and pulled out 2 skeins of Debbie Bliss Angel, bought in January 2011. (I'm beginning to detect a Debbie Bliss theme here, first Fez and now Angel?).
I am currently searching for the right project for this yarn. I have narrowed it down to two fairly straight forward projects, one was a free pattern I got when I bought some Rowan Kidsilk Haze last year and the other is Just a Whisper Wrap/Scarf by Tonia Barry. I am currently leaving towards the freebie pattern I got called Wiggly Edge Shawl, as I think the wrap would be lovely but would be a touch boring to knit..
As I have also finished my first Knit the Queue 2013 project, I thought I'd cast on for another project from my queue, a Woolly Wormhead pattern called Sumner. The pattern is from Classic Woolly Toppers and uses a 4ply yarn. The pattern specifies Semi-Precious by BabyLongLegs, but I have some really nice BooSock from BabyLongLegs in stash that I want to use instead. BooSock has 80% merino and 20% bamboo, content. It has some of the sheen and strength that Semi-Precious has, so I think the replacement will work.
This hat will hopefully be a nice Spring weight hat, though knitting it in sock weight yarn might take a while. I have caked the yarn and will start swatching this weekend.
END OF THINGS
I'm looking forward to tackling a few smaller projects for a while after the big project that was Melia. I also like that I am ticking off two more items from the ""things I want to do this year"" list and I'm using stash yarn for both.I'm hoping in the next couple of weeks my health will settle down a bit and I will have more pretty pictures to show you, but until then I will keep on blogging for myself, trying to write down the things I want to remember and hope you don't mind the shoddy writing and lacklustre photographs!",<urn:uuid:2b9ed149-a397-4069-8fab-9d2da6330597>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.stitchedtogether.co.uk/2013/03/this-posts-for-me.html,2024-02-20T22:04:59Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.97747802734375,872,0.6408972144126892,1

12. Horror films which proliferating violence, fear, horror, and sex. For many it's all just fun, and dressing up and if I talked to you, it might seem as if it was Superhero and Punky Brewster remembrance day, but the onslaught in fall of slasher films, torture porn, and all the other things I hate about modern horror films.
11. Unintended & Premature Kid Discussions. Children being exposed to horror, grotesque violence, death, witchcraft, and other things evil before they reach an appropriate age for an age-appropriate conversation. These premature discussions occur in the costumes children are exposed to, decorations, and other related Halloween displays and accouterments (see reasons 10, 9, 8 & 1). Evil exist, but there is no reason to present these topics prematurely to children, especially mixed in with dress-up and candy.
10. Toddler Witches & Devils. Young girls dressing up as witches. I saw two young girls the age of my daughter (four) in this type of costume. How do they explain what they're dressed as? I couldn't let my little girl be a witch! I feel the exact same about the little kids dressed as Satan. The red horns and pitchfork do not amuse me. In this same vein, but perhaps to a lesser extent, I find myself taken aback by babies and toddlers in costume's alluding to death (ghost and skeleton's being popular choices).
9. Bloody Boys With Cleavers. Young boys dressed in violent, bloody costumes. ""It's all fun and games"" you say, and yet I realize that those who dress as violent mass murders, bloody ghouls, and violent criminals will not become those things. Yet the news is filled with stories of young adults committing unthinkable crimes (I think of the recent developments in the Jessica Ridgeway murder as a recent example, with 17 year old criminal Austin Sigg). And you are adorning yourself in fake blood and cleavers? Tasteless.
8. Victoria's Secret Kitty. Young ladies dressed in lingerie - simply because it's October 31st. Lingerie with cat ears, devil horns, a halo, or butterfly wings, is still lingerie. Those young women are somebodies daughter, and it's a pity that this has become part of what Halloween is about.
7. Safety. I always worry a little bit about safety on these nights. It's sad that it's dangerous to walk to neighbors houses in a costume, but there are so many things to be afraid of and although I don't want to be one of ""those people"" I also don't want to be ignorant. With my oldest being four-years old my wife and I are an active part of the ""tick or treating experience"" but I look around at a number of young elementary age children traveling the neighborhoods independently, and the exposure to danger is disturbing. Most of these fears are probably irrational (the razor blade in the milk way, or the neighbor who abducting kids) but it's sometimes hard to know how to be safe and have fun at the same time when it comes to Halloween.
6. Family Budgets. The expanding commercialization of Halloween. Reports by The National Retail Federation show that families will spend an average of $80 on Halloween, mostly on costumes. Sure it's not horrible, but the report also shows a year over year increase as well, about 10% this year over last. I'm not saying the commercialization is stealing from the ""sacredness"" of the day, or anything of that nature, instead that it's another drain on family finances for something that I see as generally not valuable.
5. Adults acting Stupid. If it's all about the kids why are adults more and more using Halloween as an opportunity to party, act stupid, and participate in one night of destructive behavior, all in the name of Halloween. So now not only do you have kids walking on the street at ten at night, but you also have adults drinking and driving on those very same streets. To me, it's a big turn off when I meet an adult obsessed with Halloween as if they were seven.
4. Candy Overload and Kids. I don't know how it was in the ""good old days"" but now it seems like when it comes to getting your loot it's not about going next door...it's about going to the ""good neighborhood,"" you know...the one with the track record for giving our full size Hersey bars, not dum dums and tootsie roll pops. In these neighborhoods you race to go to as many houses as possible and you're filling up a pillow case of chocolate. This is not an amount of candy you take home and eat for a day or two - you might get enough to give yourself a healthy sugar fix on a daily basis for weeks to come.
3. Candy Overload and Adults. I have this feeling, that even though the Halloween candy aisles hit stores way before Halloween that most of the early purchases of candy somehow makes it in to the office. The last thing most adults need is multiple ""fun size"" or ""miniature"" candy bars through out the course of the day...and yet, the packages are so cute, it's easy to pop that 105 calories of Reese's Peanut Butter Cup in your mouth, a couple times a day. With adult health in America so poor, this is unfortunate, and once Halloween is over, those leftover Snickers and Smarties surely get a lot of adults consuming unneccesary calories. And that's not even counting what they're stealing from their kids' stashes.
2. Social Harm of Cheap Chocolate: In 2011, American's spent a record $2.273 billion on Halloween Candy. And as Alyce Lomax of the Montley Fool recently shared, most of the chocolate bought and given out is not fair trade, and candy makers are taking advantage of poorer nations to provide American's with a cheap good, on the backs of families and children in places like the Ivory Coast.

"Will Thomas the Train make a good chicken coop?
Thomas is left over from when Suzanna's School and Studio (my official business name) was mostly school and where I now want the garden was the playground. We had mostly girls in the school the year Thomas was created. Bob asked if we would like for him to build us a playhouse, but the girls opted for a train.
Thomas took us all over the world, including to the north pole. Sometimes we climbed up on his roof, and a few brave 5 year olds jumped off with wonderful flying leaps. Sometimes we pretended he was a dragon we were riding up over the trees and into the sky.
Thomas has been sitting empty now for about 3 years, except for the friendly wasps who built a nest inside last year,
This year, some neighbors and I decided to have chickens together. Not ""raise"" chickens, exactly. None of us wants baby chicks in the bathroom, or to wake in the wee hours to rooster crowing, but we do want eggs. With three of us to care for the chickens, we figured we would all still have the freedom to travel at times, and none of the chores would be too onerous. Also the expenses could be shared.
We spent days researching possible chicken houses that we could build for next to nothing and looking at different places we might put the chickens. We only want 4 hens to start with.
Eureka! What about Thomas the train? Several days more of researching what exactly chickens need, and measuring, and I think it just might work, with a little bit of modification. We can build windows with plexiglas--Lynn and I both have some. We need to make a door in back and put in some 2 x 4 's or branches for the hens to roost on. The space inside is 3' x 2'--just room enough for two roosts 2' long and 1' from the walls. We can pull Thomas's front out and put nesting boxes there.

"By Imaani Aslam
Chances are you know someone who is being bullied or that even you yourself have at some time in your life been bullied. A recent report revealed a staggering 69% of young people are bullied. In other words, a shocking 2 out of 3 people .
So what can be classed as bullying?
Well, it normally takes the form of emotional or physical harmful behaviour. So this can include pushing, punching, kicking, spitting, teasing, name-calling, mocking, taunting, gossiping, spreading rumours… etc, etc. Basically, anything that makes someone feel uncomfortable, scared, unhappy or unsafe.
A lot of people would like to believe bullying is just limited to the primary school playground, but it isn’t. Bullying is just as common in secondary schools, colleges, universities, in the street, at work, and even in the home.
The Prophet (pbuh) warned us of this behaviour when he said,
""Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the worst of false tales; and do not look for other’s faults, and do not do spying on one another and do not practice Najsh (ie do not offer a high price for a thing which you do not want to buy in order to deceive the people) and do not be jealous of one another and do not hate one another and do not desert (stop talking to) one another."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari)
The bully is often seen as ‘hard’ or ‘tough’ - the truth couldn’t be more different. Those who bully others are weak and cowards, who often put on the whole sweet act when faced with someone capable of putting them in their right place – proving they are anything but tough.
Due to their own inadequacies, they can’t gain any recognition in a normal civilized manner so resort to aggression to get their way, rather like an immature, attention-seeking child. There is absolutely nothing great about someone who has to make others feel like rubbish in order to make themselves feel good. This also applies to the weak sheep who laugh along and encourage the bully, but don’t have the guts to step in and do the right thing and oppose such behaviour.
They may not see it as that big a deal, but in Islam every wrong act will one day be punished. Once the Prophet (pbuh) passed by two graves and said,
""Both of them (persons in the grave) are being tortured, and they are not being tortured for a major sin. This one used not to save himself from being soiled with his urine, and the other used to go about with calumnies (spreading untrue and malicious statements about a person)."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari)
Strangely, it is often the target of the bullying who is thought of as the weak one and even blamed for being bullied, ‘coz they can’t stick up for themselves’. With bullying so widespread, it is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that over two thirds of all young people are weak or have something wrong with them.
More often than not, there is no reason at all for the bullying, and other times, any difference, be it the colour of someone’s skin, the way they talk, their size or their name are enough for some sad, envious, insecure person or group to start a hate campaign against them.
Maryam, 18, was bullied at school.
""It started when I had a falling out with this girl in my year. Her sister, who was in the year above, found out and from that day onwards she, along with her friends, started bullying me. It was mainly just name-calling and making fun of me, but they still made my life hell. I just didn’t feel like I could speak to anyone about it, coz I felt like such a wimp. My friends did used to stick up for me, but then the girls would start on them as well.""
The bullying only ended 2 years later when the girls left school. Only then did Maryam feel she could relax and start enjoying school again. However, she tells me,
""I used to be really bubbly and confident, but I’ve changed a lot. I’m a much more private person now.""
Bullying is often dismissed as just a part of growing up. Some people even believe it ""toughens"" you up or helps you cope better with difficult situations faced later on in life. In fact, the effects of bullying are quite the opposite. Bullying can lead to low self-esteem, lack of confidence, feelings of anger and bitterness, depression, self-harm and even suicidal thoughts and attempts.
Kamran, 20, admits to having been a bully.
""I just hated school and used to get chucked out of lessons all the time for messing about and stuff. I used to give this one guy a real hard time. I used to call him queer and two other guys really beat him up once coz of that. I feel really bad about it now, but back then I didn’t care. All the other guys used to think I was like dead hard and stuff, and in a way that’s why I used to be like that. I ain’t blaming them or anything, but you know if any of them had said to me shut up, I probably would have. But I think they were like I might start on them, so no-one said anything. You know what though, I think I messed up my life more than his, I mean he was quite clever so he’s probably at uni now.""
I tell Kamran about Maryam’s experience and how it has affected her character and personality, and how bullying can have serious long-term effects on a person, often leading them to self doubt their ability. Kamran tells me,
""He had a lot going for him – he was the opposite to me - it’s probably why I gave him such a hard time. I just really hope he can move on with his life.""
Bullies often have their own issues. I mean, no normal person goes around deliberately trying to ruin other people’s lives. Maybe they aren’t getting the attention they deserve by other means, or their home life is far from perfect, or maybe they’ve even been bullied themselves.
No matter what the problem, bullying others doesn’t solve anything. It may get them the attention they crave or people may do as they want, but let’s not fool anybody, it’s definitely not because they are liked or respected by their peers. It’s just to shut them up and get them off their back.
Uzma, 18, often missed school to escape her bullies.
""I used to cry myself to sleep every night knowing that tomorrow I’d have to go to school and face them all over again. I was fed up with them treating me like crap everyday - the only way I could stop it was by not going to school. I’d just tell my mum I was feeling ill, if I thought she was getting tired of my excuses I’d take headache tablets in front of her to convince her. A few times when that didn’t work, I forced myself to throw up just to prove to her I really was ill. Sitting at home, I just got more and more depressed, knowing that I was ruining my chances of making something of myself. I totally hated myself for allowing them to ruin my life.""
Like Uzma, many others too fake illnesses or skip lessons to escape being bullied. 20,000 young people truant every day because of bullying, which means a third of all truancies are actually down to bullying . Why should the one being bullied be the one to miss out on an education when it’s the bully who’s in the wrong? Why let the bullies ruin your opportunities in life and not let you reach your potential? They may be ruining things for you at the moment, but that doesn’t mean you have to let them ruin your whole life.
So what should you do if you are being bullied?
- The most important thing to do is to believe in yourself. YOU are NOT the problem. The bully is. Nobody has the right to make you feel insecure about yourself. If you’re different in any way, be proud of it.
- Don’t ignore the bullying – it WON’T go away. The bully wants a reaction, so if you ignore it, the bully will only think of different ways to get a response from you. The best thing to do is to keep a record of the bullying, noting down the exact details of things said and done to you. Also, save any abusive or threatening texts or emails you receive.
- Then… tell someone you trust about what is happening. This can be anyone you feel comfortable talking to, so a teacher, a parent, another member of your family or a friend’s parent. A lot of people find it really difficult to speak to someone they know, that’s why there are various organisations you can contact to speak to someone about what you’re going through – they are there to help you and listen to you so give them a call. Thousands upon thousands of young people contact them knowing that everything they say will be in confidence.
Most important of all…DON’T LOSE FAITH!!
Let me guess that you have often thought, ""Why me? What have I done to deserve this? If God cared about me, then He wouldn’t let this happen."" Well let me tell you, Allah (swt) DOES care about you. There isn’t a single person in this world who isn’t tested by Him – Muslims believe that is the whole purpose of this life. Only, we’re all tested according to our ability… yes, that’s right – you CAN overcome this. Allah (swt) won’t ever burden you with more than you can bear.
Shazia, 20, struggled to deal with being bullied.
""I feel embarrassed to say it, but at the time I felt like I needed someone to blame and I couldn’t think of anyone better than God Himself. I just felt so hurt and so angry. I remember thinking about committing suicide. They just made me hate myself and my life that much. The worse things got, the more I moved away from Islam.""
Even after the bullying had stopped, Shazia still struggled to get on with her life, still bitter about what had happened. She says,
""The thing is, I didn’t know that much about Islam in the first place and I think that had a lot to do with all the hate. I remember telling myself sarcastically that I would try things God’s way – I mean I had tried everything else. It wasn’t like everything changed overnight or anything, actually it was nothing like that, just slowly I started learning about Islam, and actually, I’m still learning.""
I ask Shazia what she thinks about the girls who made her want to kill herself.
""I honestly don’t think anything about them. I really don’t. I trust in Allah (swt) enough to know He’ll take care of it – we’re all going to have to answer to Him one day. This is about me… my life. And I’m going to make the most of it.""
Bullying of any sort is WRONG. It is NEVER justifiable and nobody ever deserves or ‘asks for it’.
""None of you truly believes (in Allah (swt) and His religion) until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari)
As Muslims we are instructed to treat others how we desire to be treated ourselves.

"Barry’s Seven-arch limestone road bridge in Thurles, Co Tipperary, has served the local population well; providing a primary passage across the river Suir. It was originally built circa 1650 and was again partially reconstructed circa again in 1820, widening its facade, adding safer pedestrian access.
Some 368 years later, its wedge-shaped tapered stone (voussoirs), used in the construction of its 7 arches have never once cried out seeking an upgrade, despite bearing on its back, on an average day, 850 cars with an average weight of 1.8 tons and some 46 trucks averaging between 9 and 23 tons unladen weight.
The failure by Tipperary Co. Council, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, and the Department of Transport, to deal with the now fractured surface first reported over a month ago, (December 26th 2017) now puts the bridge in grave danger of collapsing.
The failure over the past 16 years to provide the promised Thurles Bypass, begs the question can Barry’s Bridge continue to take the strain of modern heavy-duty vehicles.
One hundred and twenty yards away, in August 2017 last, a high sided truck made the careless decision to adjust the automated pedestrian crossing lights outside of Thurles Cathedral. The bulbs on this crossing used to feed motorised traffic information have been changed on two occasions since, yet the pedestrian information lights have not been realigned, leaving pedestrians unable to view the crossings signals, causing unnecessary delay to motorists. This is a busy crossing used by over 600 school children twice daily to get to and from rural school buses, not to mention the several hundred church pilgrims and local shoppers out walking each day.
Is it now time to undertake the action being used in connection with the Roran Road in Terryglass? Over 40 residents assembled in Terryglass Village Hall last night to further discuss their strategy going forward.

"Study Suggests Three Mile Island Radiation May Have Injured People Living Near Reactor
CHAPEL HILL -- Exposure to high doses of radiation shortly after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island may have increased cancer among Pennsylvanians downwind of the plant, scientists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill say.
Dr. Steven Wing, associate professor of epidemiology at the UNC-CH School of Public Health, led a study of cancer cases within 10 miles of the facility from 1975 to 1985. He and colleagues conclude that following the March 28, 1979 accident, lung cancer and leukemia rates were two to 10 times higher downwind of the Three Mile Island (TMI) reactor than upwind.
A paper Wing and colleagues wrote appears in the January issue of the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, scheduled to appear Feb. 24. They first presented their findings last July at the University of Portsmouth in Portsmouth, United Kingdom, at the International Workshop on Radiation Exposures by Nuclear Facilities.
""I would be the first to say that our study doesn't prove by itself that there were high-level radiation exposures, but it is part of a body of evidence that is consistent with high exposures,"" Wing said. ""The cancer findings, along with studies of animals, plants and chromosomal damage in Three Mile Island area residents, all point to much higher radiation levels than were previously reported. If you say that there was no high radiation, then you are left with higher cancer rates downwind of the plume that are otherwise unexplainable.""
Co-authors of the report are Dr. Douglas Crawford-Brown, professor of environmental sciences and engineering, and Dr. Donna Armstrong and David Richardson, former and current doctoral students in epidemiology, all at UNC-CH.
The new study involved re-analyzing data from a 1990 report that concluded the nation's worst civilian nuclear accident was not responsible for slightly increased cancer rates near the plant because radiation exposures were too low. Wing and colleagues re-examined data from that report using what they believed were better analytic and statistical techniques.
""Several hundred people at the time of the accident reported nausea, vomiting, hair loss and skin rashes, and a number said their pets died or had symptoms of radiation exposure,"" he said. ""We figured that if that were possible, we ought to look at it again. After adjusting for pre-accident cancer incidence, we found a striking increase in cancers downwind from Three Mile Island.""
The scientists do not believe smoking and social and economic factors were responsible for the increased cancers found in the downwind sectors.
Many earlier researchers, as well as government and industry officials, accept as fact that only small amounts of radiation were released into the atmosphere, Wing said. But it is known that plant radiation monitors went off scale when the accident started. Plumes containing higher radiation could have passed undetected, he said.
Findings from the re-analysis of cancer incidence around TMI is consistent with the theory that radiation from the accident increased cancer in areas that were in the path of radioactive plumes, the scientist said.
""This cancer increase would not be expected to occur over a short time in the general population unless doses were far higher than estimated by industry and government authorities,"" Wing said. ""Our findings support the allegation that the people who reported rashes, hair loss, vomiting and pet deaths after the accident were exposed to high level radiation and not only suffering from emotional stress.""
The UNC-CH scientist said he found it ironic that U.S. District Court Judge Sylvia Rambo dismissed more than 2,000 damage claims filed against the power plant by nearby residents last year citing a ""paucity of proof"" to support their cases.
""Judge Rambo spent a year or more throwing out scientific evidence presented by the plaintiffs,"" he said. ""After she threw out the evidence that people had been injured by the accident, including part of our work, then she ruled that there wasn't enough to proceed with the case.""
He also noted that the court gave attorneys for the nuclear industry the right to review the earlier health effects research before it was made public. ""I think our findings show there ought to be a more serious investigation of what happened after the Three Mile Island accident,"" Wing said.
Limitations of the new study, like the earlier work, include the continuing difficulty of determining precise wind direction for several days following the accident.",<urn:uuid:c0b751fb-0f01-45f2-ae9f-9dc41bdbe23a>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.tmia.com/content/study-suggests-three-mile-island-radiation-may-have-injured-people-living-near-reactor,2024-02-20T23:15:48Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9807625412940979,900,2.532613515853882,3
"Nest Eggs for Nuclear Plant Close Downs Fall Short
By Marlene Lang
Think you are the only one who can't manage to set aside a nest egg? Don't feel lonely. Your neighborhood nuclear power plant may be busily creating a remedial savings plan of its own.
Twenty-six plants nationwide showed shortfalls in the funds they are required by federal law to set aside for dismantling the reactors someday and cleaning up after themselves. The closely watched Three Mile Island plant was not on the shortfall list.
Every year the Nuclear Regulatory Commission checks on the state of so-called ""decommissioning funds."" Most years there are only a handful of plants running short of having those estimated costs laid up, usually four or five one official said. Those billions set aside for close-down and clean-up don't just pile up under a mattress, of course; the money is invested in the stock market. According to an Associated Press report, some $4.4 billion in decommissioning funds was lost in the downturn, even as the actual costs for shutting down plants has risen by $4.6 billion because of (I love this part) rising energy costs – and labor costs.
Illinois' Braidwood Station, Byron Station and LaSalle County Station, each with two nuclear reactors, and the Clinton Power Station are all on the NRC's shortfall list. What does it mean?
At worst, it could mean another scenario like the DuPage River fiasco, a radioactive mess still in a mess, though it happened in 1973. Yes, 1973.
Thirty-one years later, in 2004, the clean-up began along the West Branch of the DuPage River, west of Chicago,but the job is on hold again as the culprit company's bankruptcy languishes in court.
With the worst of the radioactive residue still awaiting cleanup, legal scratch-and-claw is ongoing over who gets what from Tronox, Inc., and who will be financially responsible for the multiple millions the job will cost. At least $12 million of the yet-unpaid costs are expected to come from your federal government.
The upside of the DuPage River debacle is that the cleanup HAS begun.
Plans for fund-challenged nuclear power plants are to let them sit for about six decades, or however long it takes to accumulate the cash to safely dismantle those reactors and remove those nasty, hot and highly radioactive uranium fuel pellets. Sixty years, idle, is the time-frame estimate the NRC gave media earlier this month.
Is it possible that the plant whose steam billows you see on your way to work each morning could do an impromptu morph into a radioactive waste dump, because the industry can't afford to shut it down and clean it up?
The NRC assures us that this will not happen. We simply live in ""extraordinary economic times,"" according to one spokesman, who noted that fluctuations in the decommissioning accounts are to be expected. Fluctuations.
I was not consoled and remained uneasy at the thought of idle nuclear reactors waiting longer than my lifetime for cleanup money.
I didn't need to be an engineer to wonder what happens when things get, well, rusty? But immediately I doubted my common sense; I asked if maybe we, the non-technical public, are ill-informed? Maybe even stupid? Maybe magical nuclear power plants don't actually rust; maybe they can rest safely forever on waterfronts near our homes and always safely contain that high-level radioactive fuel.
I tried to believe, but I lacked what the nuclear industry and U.S. government policy refer to as: Waste Confidence. This is a doctrine – and I chose that word carefully – which says that the nuclear industry can continue to function and grow even though it has the big gaping problem of what to do with its own leftovers, being confident that a solution will be found. When common sense fails, there is always faith.
In April, a small hole was discovered in a reactor containment wall of the Beaver Valley nuclear power plant near Pittsburgh, an aging facility that began operating in 1976 and is applying for re-licensing as we speak. A FirstEnergy company spokesman told media that ""it appears the rust corroded the steel from the inside out.""
If it is any consolation, the hole was small; the size of a paper clip.
What to do? The better question may be, what not to do. How about we listen to common sense and NOT build any more of these reactors until we have solved the great mystery of what to do with the waste, and can afford to pay for that solution?

"A rising outflow of New Zealander’s to Australia is causing concern amongst a bunch of people. People move away for a number of reasons, as the Department of Labour nicely points out. However, as economists we like to think at the margin. We are not interested in the general reasons that people are leaving New Zealand, in so much as we are interested in the ‘marginal’ factors that are driving people overseas. The non-policy factors mentioned by DOL are constant, the weather will stay warmer, the country will remain as close, and the culture will remain similar. However, the policy factors (e.g wages, taxes) can be changed, and as a result will have an impact on the ‘change’ in migration levels (beyond some sort of trend).
The Standard provides one piece of the puzzle we require in order to control migrant outflows – we need higher wages. However, the solutions they provide may not necessarily be the correct ones. A important marginal factor in the decision on whether to stay and work in NZ, or do so in Australia is the difference in ‘real disposable income’. Ignoring non-wage income for now leaves us with ‘real disposable salary’. Increasing nominal wages may not lead to an increase in real disposable salary if all it does is increase inflation. If we pay everyone more $$$ but don’t increase the number of goods avaliable to buy, then the price of goods will increase and peoples true living standard will not change.
There are two ways people are talking about increasing real disposable salary:
- Tax cuts that increase the demand for labour more than they increase the supply of labour, or that cause a smaller reduction in the real wage than the quantity of the tax cut, or transfer funds into more productive sectors,
- An increase in labour productivity.
Fundamentally, both these solutions require policy that increases the amount of product produced by labour. Now this begs the question, how do we increase labour productivity relative to Australia.
By cutting taxes we stimulate the economy, although if we are running a balanced budget there must be reduction in government spending, if people value government spending sufficiently this may lead to more people moving overseas! For simplicity lets assume that the stimulus is canceled out by a reduction in government spending.
First let us thing about an individual firm. If some of the incidence of tax falls on the firm then this will increase their cash flows, allowing them to invest more. As an increase in capital increases the marginal product of labour, this will increase wages. However, lower taxes make labour relatively cheaper than capital, increasing the incentive for firms to hire labour instead of capital. As the marginal product of labour falls as the quantity of labour rises, and as capital expenditure has eased, this will put downward pressure on wages. As a result, we care ultimately care about which of these effects dominates, when deciding whether tax cuts will actually increase real wages.
However, one thing we do know about tax cuts is that it decreases the cost of production for the firm – implying that production must increase. As a result, the question we have to ask is whether this surplus is passed on to employees or whether it accrues to the owners of capital – this is an empirical question.
Other arguments have been made stating that we should increase taxes on labour or improve the power of unions in order to increase the relative price of labour, thereby leading to an increase in capital and an increase in the marginal product of labour. There are a few important things to note about this point of view:
- It will lead to a reduction in production in the short-run, as it increases firms costs,
- It may not lead to an increase in capital, as labour increases the marginal product of capital,
- This point of view requires a cut in employment, and so supports people losing their jobs (something I did not expect the left wing blogs to be supporting).
As this policy will reduce national output, its impact on peoples real wage will depend on how it redistributes production between the owners of capital and workers. If increased union power was sufficient enough relative to the change in output, then it may in fact increase the real wage of employees (this would involve a significant of amount of employer power in the labour market currently).
Further discussion has focused on ‘strategic complementarity’ between firms (eg if one firm increases its capital input, it may lead to other firms increasing their capital input). In this case we need to define the spillovers (R&D spillovers?) and figure out how important they are to the problem. The existence of ‘multiple equilibria’ in the economy depends on these spillovers or strategic interactions – so if you hear anyone say that higher taxes may move us too a new, pareto superior equilibrium, ask them what the source of the strategic complementarity is, if they can’t answer you they are talking trash 😉
Ultimately, the impact of government policy on productivity and thereby on migration is an inherently empirical matter, as theory can point use either way. As data on New Zealand labour productivity is relatively recent, subject to constant revisions, and filled with structural breaks, any killer blow to the ideas coming from the left or right of the spectrum is unlikely to appear.
Anyone that can improve my logic, or explain to me where I might be mixed up is welcome to do so in the comments 😉",<urn:uuid:1e9270af-a22e-4d82-adb5-4927529fd470>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.tvhe.co.nz/2008/02/05/migrant-outflows-to-australia-wages-and-productivity-what-is-going-on/,2024-02-20T22:59:47Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9450867772102356,1113,2.0095062255859375,2
"From the fabulous folks down at Seed Savers Exchange in Decorah, IA, a great article explaining plant pollination:
How your plants pollinate
By: JUNE 14, 2012 | No Comments
Our teaching garden at Seed Savers Exchange demonstrates important seed saving concepts. Throughout the season, I’ll take you on a tour to discuss some of these concepts. The first stop on our tour is the Pollination bed. It is important that seed savers understand how their plants pollinate in order to prevent varieties in the same species from cross-pollinating. In this bed we are growing tomatillos, spinach, amaranth and cucumbers to demonstrate different flower types.
Flowers exist to facilitate pollination, which occurs when pollen is transferred from the male anther to the female stigma. In some plants, this occurs before the flower even opens. In other plants, pollinators such as humans, insects, or wind are required to transfer the pollen.
Tomatillos have perfect flowers. These flowers have both male and female organs, allowing for self-pollination. Tomatillos are “selfers” that can pollinate before their flower even opens.
Selfers are good plants to choose if you are a beginning seed saver. Selfers include tomatoes, peppers, beans, peas, and lettuce. And remember, in nature there are always exceptions to the rule—just because a plant can self-pollinate doesn’t mean that it can’t cross pollinate.
Spinach and cucumber have imperfect flowers. These flowers have either male or female organs. If male and female flowers are on different plants, the species isdioecious. In order to produce seed, pollen must travel from male plants to the female plants. Spinach is dioecious, and requires the wind to pollinate. Asparagus is also dioecious, and relies on insects for pollination.
Cucumber flowers are imperfect as well. However, cucumbers—as well as squash, melons, watermelons, and gourds—are monoecious, with male and female flowers on the same plant. Notice the immature fruit at the base of the female flower pictured above. In the Cucurbitaceae family, insects are required to transfer pollen from male flowers to female flowers for pollination to occur. Corn is also a monoecious plant with imperfect flowers (the tassels represent the male flowers, and the developing ears represent the female flowers), though corn relies on wind for pollination.
Take a few minutes to identify male and female flowers in your home garden. Congratulations you are officially one step closer to becoming a seed saver!",<urn:uuid:3c4212b8-b6af-4258-bd52-0c0208b61da4>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.unitednectar.com/2012/06/from-fabulous-folks-down-at-seed-savers.html,2024-02-20T21:44:20Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9475261569023132,558,3.1941535472869873,3
"BuzzFeed: The Washington conversation about Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath has shifted quickly from concern about climate change to a fight over federal cash.
One week after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg lobbied Congress for disaster relief funding to supplement Sandy recovery efforts, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee considered the state of the recovery on Capitol Hill Tuesday, and the central question was the place and expense of the federal role in disaster recovery.

"401k retirement savings plans are terrific ways to save for retirement. They use the power of investment and compound interest to deliver tremendous returns based on how much you put in each year. By the time you are able to withdraw your funds without penalty – at the age of 59 ½ – the percentage of your total amount that was accumulated by your investments absolutely dwarfs the amount you put into it out of your monthly salary.
In other words, you’ll make far more for retirement with a 401k than you would simply by saving your money and putting it into a low-yield savings account. Plus, the fact that you gain access to free money through employer contributions is a huge bonus.
Still, having a 401k means you have to make certain decisions involving your investment allocations. Where should you put your money? What are the pros and cons of the options available to you? There are nearly two dozen investment options; which is the best for you? Here, I’ll cover the main five – stocks, bonds, mutual funds, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts – and give you an overview for each one.
Money Market Accounts
I’ll start with money market accounts, because they are generally the safest option available. A money market account works by paying interest on your money when it is placed into money markets, or markets that buy and sell Treasury bills, bank certificates of deposits, federal funds, commercial paper, and the like. It’s a short-term market, not a long-term market like bonds and stocks.
Money market accounts deliver lower rates than other options, but they beat the return you’d get by having your money sit in a savings account or checking account. The advantage is that they are generally viewed as safe places to put your money because they are insured by the FDIC and aren’t very volatile.
Pros: Low volatility and risk; insured by FDIC
Cons: Lowest rate of return
Certificates of Deposit
You can also allocate your money into certificates of deposit, which are financial products that give you a certain rate of return if you keep your money in them for a certain period of time (called a fixed term). You can find CDs that have terms of one month, three months, six months, one year, or more – up to five years, in most cases. They deliver a predictable rate of return that can be higher than what you receive with a money market account if you go for longer maturities.
The downside, again, is that they do not offer nearly as high a rate of return as some other options. Additionally, CDs are susceptible to inflation because they are not very liquid if you go for bigger returns through longer terms. Rising inflation can eat into and even vanish your gains.
Pros: Low risk; insured by FDIC
Cons: Not as profitable as most options; susceptible to inflation for long terms
Bonds as an asset class offer a step up from either of the two mentioned above. Heading into this territory can be a bit tricky, though, because there are several types of bonds out there. In general, there are three types most 401k participants use: municipal bonds; Treasury bonds; and corporate bonds.
Treasury bonds (T-Bonds) are issued by the U.S. Treasury and are viewed as the safest investments in the world because they’re backed by the U.S. government. They come in three flavors, depending on their maturity: T-Bills (mature in one year or less); T-Notes (mature in 2-10 years); and T-Bonds (mature in 20-30 years). T-Bonds and T-Notes both pay what is called a coupon payment every six months; this amount is a percentage of the note’s value paid to you. Collectively, all three of these are called Treasurys.
Rates of return (called “yields”) for these vary; historically, they have underperformed stocks (except from 2002 to 2011, when they actually outperformed stocks by a significant amount).
Municipal bonds are similar to T-Bonds in that they are issued by a government agency and come with a term, a maturity, and a fluctuating interest rate. Most municipal bonds are considered quite safe and generate decent returns, but they vary considerably because not all cities and local governments are created equal. These generally return lower rates than all other bond types. But – and this is a big but – these are usually exempt from federal, state, and local taxes.
Corporate bonds offer the largest rates of return, typically, and are issued by corporations as a way to finance their operations. They are similar to the other two bond types, but have a higher risk of default than either. Of course, that’s why they also offer better returns.
Pros: T-Bonds are the safest investments you can make; less risk than stocks; predictable returns
Cons: Less liquid than the above assets; outperformed in most years by stocks; subject to some volatility; default wipes out value
A mutual fund is a collection of assets that you can own under the umbrella of the fund. Most are managed professionally, either actively – a fund manager trades assets regularly for maximum return – or passively – they are tied to an index or have some automated way to change asset allocation. You can find mutual funds for virtually every asset class, including bonds, money markets, and stocks. Your average investor pictures stock-based (or equity) mutual funds when they think of the term.
Mutual funds typically offer better returns than bonds, CDs, or money market accounts but smaller returns than investing in a pure stock portfolio. They are safer than stocks, though, and also give you the chance to easily diversify your portfolio, which insulates you a bit from downturns in the market.
Mutual funds, though, come with fees that are paid regardless of if the fund performs well. Plus, you don’t have control of what assets the fund owns.
Pros: Better return than bonds and the other above asset classes; diversification; safer than stocks
Cons: Lower returns, on average, than stocks; subject to volatility and risk
Finally, we are at the main asset most people think when they picture using their 401k assets to invest: stocks.
Stocks typically offer a far greater return than any other asset class and are very flexible. From 2006 to 2011, stocks routinely topped the charts of the annual returns of several benchmark asset classes, bested usually only by gold. You can buy shares of stock in thousands of companies across the world, and this stock can be sold quickly and easily for cash, making it a very liquid asset.
The disadvantages of stocks, though, are considerable. For starters, it takes some experience and knowledge to pick the right stocks. You can remedy this somewhat by choosing an exchange-traded fund that is traded like a stock but covers several different assets. Also, stocks are volatile and generally the riskiest assets, with the possible exception of credit default swaps, high-yield “junk” bonds, and other similar assets. You can lose far more, on average, with stocks than you can with bonds, mutual funds, or any other asset class.
Choosing stocks is for people who want more of an aggressive strategy in their 401k portfolio.
Pros: Usually offer the highest rates of return; liquid; provide thousands of choices
Cons: Volatile; riskier than the other major asset classes; harder to invest in successfully
Which One Should You Pick?
Ideally, you should have a well-rounded, balanced, and diversified portfolio with a little bit of everything thrown in. Bonds and money market accounts and certificates of deposits provide some balance against a turbulent stock market and give you a safe harbor for your money; stocks give you the earning power that can turn your contributions into a sizable nest egg.
You need a little of all to truly make your portfolio successful. But, the degree to which you choose one asset over the other is largely dependent on your risk profile.",<urn:uuid:1a49075e-6118-4c80-a680-2136a50e4f5a>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.wisestockbuyer.com/2012/06/where-should-i-invest-my-401k/,2024-02-20T22:58:47Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9595096707344055,1678,1.8553739786148071,2
"October 12, 2022 – New York City, NY – Much was said about the future of link building when Google released the Penguin update in 2012. Many experts believe that links are no longer a significant ranking factor. In fact, it is an attempt by Google to penalize websites that use unnatural link building methods while rewarding websites that use white hat link building techniques. It is still relevant and important in SEO. Links can help you improve your SEO ranking if they are generated ethically. If you’re doing it in-house, keep reading to learn the tips and tricks of quality link building methods as explained by AuroIN LLC, one of the leading digital marketing agencies in the United States since 2000.
There are two types of links that can influence your website’s ranking:
#1 External Links:
You should invest in creating high-quality backlinks for your website because backlinks are crucial for SEO. External backlinks are hyperlinks pointing to your website from other websites. Content promotion is the most natural way to gain backlinks.
These links are crucial because they increase the credibility and authority of your website. A trustworthy website linking back to your page informs Google that your website is reliable. If a reputable website links to your page, it implies that your content is both reputable and compelling.
Because Google thinks more people will be interested in your content, they will rank your website higher. Your ranking will rise as you acquire more backlinks. They are constantly enhancing the trustworthiness of your website.
Backlinks are primarily acquired through the creation of content. By publishing high-quality, information-rich content, you can draw users to your website and ask other webmasters to read it. If they enjoy it, they might mention it on their own websites.
This is one of the ways to build backlinks. When someone reads their article, they can now click on the link that leads back to your website. It’s an excellent way to generate new traffic and leads for your company.
Focus on backlinks that will bring relevant traffic to your website when you’re trying to obtain them. It is best if websites with a focus on your industry link to your content. This guarantees that the traffic you are driving is interested in your business.
You can improve the trust and authority of your site by increasing the number of backlinks it has.
#2 Internal links:
Internal links are critical for increasing user engagement and time on your site. You want people to stay on your website so they can learn more about your products and services. These are links to other parts of your website/pages that contain related information to help your audience learn more about your products or services. It is intended to improve their understanding of your business at large. It has two advantages: 1) it lowers the bounce rate and 2) it increases the time spent on your site.
Utilizing inbound links allows you to direct visitors to the following page. They will stay on your page longer, which boosts your SEO ranking. Google values your page more when visitors stay on it for a longer period of time.
Having inbound links is a great way to keep visitors on your website. They can stay interested as you teach them more about your company. This will assist you in nurturing leads and motivating them to convert.
One of the most critical aspects of inbound links is that they must be tested to ensure their functionality. You must not only ensure that your content is up to date, but that the links are also active. If a particular landing page is removed or deleted, you should hyperlink to other active pages of the website instead of making the users click on a broken link.
It is recommended to check your links on a regular basis to ensure that they are working and directing users to the correct page.
The top 7 backlink-building strategies are listed below:
There are many shortcuts to getting backlinks, but using them will almost certainly get your website in trouble, and it will be penalized sooner or later. Therefore, link building will only be successful if the right approach and strategy are used. It will improve your website’s ranking, which will lead to better ranking, more traffic, leads, and ultimately conversion. Different websites follow different strategies, and the following are some of the most important ones to consider:
Recognizing your target audience
It is critical to understand your current audience and their demographics in order to target the ideal audience for your website. This will help you reach new audiences who are interested in what you have to offer while also maintaining and growing your current audience.
Do some research to learn more about your target audience. This will not only enable you to understand them better, but it will also help you to know more about your target market/traffic and whether you are currently reaching them.
List the websites to find people interested in your type of business:
Once you’ve determined who your target audience is, compile a list of websites that can assist you in reaching them. Look for websites that have a sizable following among this demographic. You could reach out to people who are interested in your website but aren’t aware of it with the help of links from these websites.
To persuade other websites to link to your content, you must first provide compelling content. Create content that answers a question or solves a problem for your audience.
If you give them the information they need, you’ll not only earn their trust but you’ll also get more links to your page because other websites will value the information you have to offer.
List the websites where you’ll publish your content:
It’s time to review the list of websites you’ve built once you’re satisfied with the content you’ve written. What websites have the highest chances of linking to the content you’ve written? Make wise choices and try to find websites that relate to the subject of your blog post or page. These websites are more likely to link to your blog post because it is pertinent to their content.
Speak with the website owners:
It’s time to get in touch with the websites (s) you intend to get a link from. You can use email to communicate with others, but social media sites like Twitter are also useful. Increase your chances of getting a link to your page by explaining why your content is unique.
Use social media as a platform for link generation:
Another great way to get links and reach out to new audiences is through social media. Don’t forget to post your new content on social media platforms like Twitter. Send out a few tweets to people who you think might be interested in your post.
Facebook is yet another excellent way to increase the visibility of your articles. It also enables you to market your content and connect with new people. You’re likely to receive some additional links in return when people like, share, and discuss your content on social media.

"The Baghdad Battery
Ancient Electricity ?
The one we know today as the Baghdad Battery is a small amphora found in Khujut Rabu in 1936, in an archaeological site near the Iraqi capital. About 15 centimeters high, it contains a small copper cylinder 9 centimeters long and 2.6 centimeters in diameter, closed at the ends by two bitumen plugs; inside is an iron bar. It dates from around 200 BC, when the Parthian people lived in the region. Although similar containers were often used for the conversation of papyri, Wilhelm Konig, an Austrian archaeologist, immediately noticed the resemblance of this object with another already quite widespread in the 1930s: the carbon zinc battery.
How could these people have known electricity from the 2nd century BC? It is difficult to assert anything in this matter, because, indeed, any object comprising two different metals immersed in an acid solution can function as a battery.
This Baghdad Battery can only produce discontinuous electric power and very low power, because it does not have some details specific to our current batteries. If researchers tested different substances, only copper sulphate gives good results, although of short duration. Some are convinced that the ancients had surprisingly advanced technological knowledge, inherited from civilizations like that of the survivor of Atlantis. However, they only knew how to use them summarily. But if that were the case, what could be the use of such an object by the Parthians?
Today, the low-voltage current that could be produced by the Baghdad Battery is used for the plating of gold, a process which makes it possible to create a thin sheet of the precious metal and to perfectly cover an object with it. Many precious objects have been discovered in archaeological sites around the world, the exact details of which remain a mystery. This does not prove, however, that they are the result of this process. In addition, nothing was found next to the amphora that would conduct electricity from the battery to the possible object to work.
The amphora used for the sacred papyrus could contain metal statuettes bearing the image of the deities. Now, how is it that the iron rod found in the Baghdad Battery is corroded as if it had been in contact with acids? Could it be, as some claim, that these ancient peoples had knowledge of electricity without knowing how to use it?
Of course, the mystery of the Baghdad Battery remains intact. What if, among those who think that these objects were brought by extraterrestrials and purely rational scientific theories, the truth was still elsewhere?
In a battery, two different reactions take place near the electrodes and produce energy. These reactions which release the electrons take place between the electrodes and the substances dissolved in the liquid where these are immersed. A battery has two poles, one positive, the other negative. The electrons, usually located at the bottom of the battery, do not activate if the poles are not connected. When we place a battery in any device, its two poles connect to the circuits of that device, which releases electrons and produces electrical energy.",<urn:uuid:c21ef44d-8be5-4d8e-ae64-302102b48ba6>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,http://www.worlds-greatest-riddles.com/baghdad-battery.php,2024-02-20T23:33:16Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9701716303825378,625,3.364809513092041,3

"How and why did I get involved in the Zawiercie web site?
Zawiercie Web Site
December 1, 2014
The Zawiercie web site was redesigned. The new version includes all the material that was presented in the older version with additional pages.
The current history page includes new essays and references about the history of Kromolow and Zawiercie in general and in particular the history of the Jewish community.
The web site is work in progress and we will be happy to receive photographs, stories and data of the Jewish life in Kromolow and Zawiercie.
Zawiercie Jewish Cemetery
Dec 26, 2014
I finally organized all the pictures I could find and I created a site on my Facebook page titled “Zawiercie Jewish Cemetery Restoration Project.”
As regards the cemetery, Marcin Bergier was very busy this year clearing the vegetation and smaller trees as well as the area at the entrance behind the two buildings either side of the gate. He also contacted the city to empty the garbage can behind the carriage house. I have also sent him a chainsaw, which he plans on using next year to take down some of the smaller trees... One of the most difficult issue we are dealing with are the two buildings on either side of the entrance gate. The one on the left is the carriage house and the one on the right is where the caretaker lived and the bodies were prepared for burial. These two buildings have serious structural damage... If we don’t get some serious money, the two buildings will likely have to be torn down. If anyone has any idea about a charitable organization we can contact to get a grant, please let me know.
Please forward this note to anyone I may have missed.

On Tuesday April 9, 2013 Joe Greenbaum send email to a group of people that have an interest in the town of Zawiercie:
""Dear Friends and Family, I would like to inform you that the city of Zawiercie is planning to commemorate the 70th Anniversary of the liquidation of the Zawiercie ghetto on Thursday, August 29, 2013. Attached, you will find the invitation and a preliminary program schedule. ""
The event took place on August 29, 2013 and Heidi Urich shared with me her experience:
""I attended the Zawiercie commemoration and found it to be a very worthwhile experience. I was particularly moved by the procession from the marketplace at the edge of the ghetto to the train station. In addition to town officials, there appeared to be a great many town residents who joined us as we walked about a mile on the route our family members were forced to take as they were being deported to Auschwitz. A large plaque commemorating the Jewish community was unveiled at the train station opposite the tracks in a solemn ceremony. This was followed by another ceremony at the Jewish cemetery. ""
How and why did I get involved in the Zawiercie website?
My grandmother, Chana Arieli-Kaluzynski nee Sznajderman, was born and lived in Zawiercie. Her parents, one of her brothers, and other relatives are buried in the cemetery in Zawiercie cemetery. Their graves are standing there among other graves as a memorial to the Jewish life in the town before WWII.
My grandmother’s dream was to immigrate to Israel, and in 1906 she left Zawiercie for Israel. Two of her brothers, Dawid and Shlomo, followed her with their spouses, Malka and Rachel Hampel. A third brother and his wife, Israel and Szyendel nee Markovitz, followed a couple of years later and stayed there for a short period of time. Her sister, Rywka Paisak nee Sznajderman, also joined her family few years after that.
My grandmother was a storyteller and liked to talk about her youth, about Zawiercie, and about her new life in Israel. Unfortunately, we, her grandchildren, weren’t attentive enough to her stories. We started to appreciate them too late in her life when she was old and didn’t have much energy to talk and be recorded.
Zawiercie, 1906 - The Sznajderman and Hampel(?) families
Grandmother was the only one to share her stories; her brother Dawid never uttered a word about the place. Those were not stories of nostalgia and yearning for Zawiercie. The anecdotes were engulfed by memories of pogroms and dark experiences.
The following paragraph is a quote from a letter sent to my grandfather after WWII. The author of the letter is a nephew of my grandmother, the son of her oldest brother, Abraham Moshe Sznajderman.
I don’t remember Uncle David (Sznajderman). I can’t recall how he looked, but I do remember that he was a good painter. I do remember that in the grandma’s room [Eigda Sznajderman nee Sztatler], above her bed, was a big picture of Gorki, the writer, which was painted as far as I know by Uncle David. I also remember, but only from grandma’s tales, that in Zawiercie, by the Blanowska St., hooligans had stabbed Uncle David with knives. I wonder if he remembers that. |
There are people from Zawiercie who wrote in “Zawiercie Yizkor Book” about their passionate love for the town, like the superb chapter by Pinchas Erlich, where he almost sings about every charmed corner in Zawiercie and about its Jewish life.
For me, creating the Zawiercie website, searching for people who are also linked to Zawiercie, searching for records, photos, stories and memories about the town, and translating Zawiercie Yizkor book are links to the roots of the family in this small place in Poland.
The goal of the Zawiercie website is not only to detail the history, geography, and demography of Kromolow and Zawiercie but also to bring together the stories and photos of the Jewish people who survived the Holocaust in Zawiercie. The site will include links to vital records on other sites, and hard copies of records on sites not yet explored by the main genealogy organizations: Jewishgen.org and CRARG.org. Most importantly, it will include links to books, memories, stories, and photos published in various books and other websites, as well as hard copies of photos and stories published here for the first time. Below are links to families who have already shared with us data and photos.

"We are animals: the case for empathy
When on holiday recently in Iceland on a remote, deserted road I saw two sheep being hit by a truck. I stared aghast as one twitched and quivered in its death throes, paralysed on its back, the second, hind legs, pelvis and spine crushed by giant wheels, trying to drag itself to safety on its remaining two legs. It was awful. The sheep cried constantly and would not give up in its pointless efforts to survive. If I could, I would have done just about anything to help. But I had no gun, no way to put both poor souls out of their misery, so had to wait for the local farmer to do it, eventually, a painful, truly gruesome twenty minute wait.
Why did I so desperately want to help? Why did I cry (after all, I eat lamb twice a week…)? Why did I shake so? Why did I feel so terrible, helpless, guilty and despairing that I could do nothing practical for those poor creatures, beyond suffering with them? Why can I not forget this incident, a common enough occurrence in these parts?
Because I am an animal too.
Therefore I literally feel the pain of other animals. You do too. We feel their emotions, their desperation, their cries of anguish, their pleading to understand and survive. I, like 99 percent of people have a wonderful thing – empathy. It enables me to feel what you are feeling, and vice-versa. It makes me want to help you.
(1) Empathy. It means that somehow, we just know how our cat is feeling, that our child needs food or that someone needs our help. It’s often illogical, it’s unconscious and it’s the most powerful motivator for charitable giving there is. If you have ever physically felt the pain of a crushed, soon to die sheep you will understand.
(2) Empathy. Creating a mood or feeling that spreads to another person, or a crowd.
(3) Empathy. The creation of emotions that compel us to act, rather than think or say.
(4) Empathy. A fundraising skill so often lost in an overcomplicated world of far-too-long cases for support, complex budget projections, impact assessments, data analysis and profiling, logical frameworks and endless arguments about overhead cost.
You communicate better and raise more money if you communicate with real emotion, therefore creating powerful empathy in those around you and your donors. All the evidence says this is true.
Yet fundraisers too often hide their real emotional behaviours behind a façade that we refer to as ‘professionalism.’ Instead of just letting our feelings rip, we dress up in fancy language and try to somehow justify our most basic of emotional responses in logical frameworks or analysis.
Competent fundraisers will master the management techniques listed in point (4) above.
Outstanding fundraisers will be able to change the mood of their colleagues, volunteers and donors by mastering the art of personal emotional excellence and the creation of empathy on a mass scale. Outstanding fundraisers will open their souls and write, speak, tweet, blog and design in an emotionally exquisite way which compels people to act, and to act now.
Technique and training will help us craft sentences and choose good pictures. But there’s more to it that that. I credit Tim Longfoot of Open fundraising with this quote; ‘If there are no tears from the writer, there will be no tears from the reader.’ I can’t put it better than that.
Emotions are hard wired and learned young. They are deep inside us. We need to take off the over-analytical masks, become confident in our emotional realities and communicate like nature intended – as animal to animal. Spreading empathy raises vast sums of money and is inspiring and motivating to us and our donors.
I shall be delighted to work through this with you at ‘Fired up for Fundraising’ at the International Fundraising Congress, the Netherlands, 15th – 18th October. At this year’s IFC we can all take simple delight in being animals once again, and not just at the party.

An error occurred while saving the comment AdminEvan Deaubl (Admin, 12 Strikes) commentedIf you specify a new league name when you are adding games, that will create those games with a new league, and then anytime you add games in the future, it should show up in the autocomplete box.
If you want to look at the averages for just one league, tap the magnifying glass to do a search, and enter the league in the League box, tap “< Games”, and then tap the bar graph icon to do the average analysis, and it will only include the games from that league in the calculation.
Let me know if that fixes your issue, or if you need any further assistance!
An error occurred while saving the comment AdminEvan Deaubl (Admin, 12 Strikes) commentedLonnie,
As a temporary workaround, after you've created the games, you can tap the blue arrow beside a game to change the date for a game. You need to do this for each individual game for now; I plan to add this field to the new series screen so you can do it for a full set of games.
An error occurred while saving the comment AdminEvan Deaubl (Admin, 12 Strikes) commentedThanks for the feature request. You can change the date of an individual game by tapping the blue button next to the game in the game list. This brings up the game details page, and on that page, game date is one of the things you can change.
You cannot currently set the date when you create an entire series, though. That feature is planned for a future version.
An error occurred while saving the comment AdminEvan Deaubl (Admin, 12 Strikes) commentedJust wanted to check and make sure of one thing first. Have you looked at the preferences screen by tapping the gear on the main app screen? There is an option on that screen to reverse the position and target sliders for left handed bowling.
If you already found that, great! If that isn't sufficient, let me know what other changes you need for left handed bowling. I need a little help in this area; I don't bowl left handed. :-)
An error occurred while saving the comment AdminEvan Deaubl (Admin, 12 Strikes) commentedThanks Scott for the feature request. Example 1 will be available as part of version 2.2 when cumulative league statistics are added. The other two examples are new criteria that will need to be added to the search so that analysis is limited to just those games.
You can currently do a Stats by Day analysis for a specific league by tapping the search icon, selecting a single league to filter games by, then running the Stats by Day analysis. The analysis will only be run on the games that show up in the search results (so the same thing works for alley, date, etc. as well).

New NIST Method Accelerates Stability Testing of Soy-Based Biofuel
Gaithersburg, Md. (Jan. 15)—The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a method to accelerate stability testing of biodiesel fuel made from soybeans and also identified additives that enhance stability at high temperatures. The results, described in a new paper, could help overcome a key barrier to practical use of biofuels. Both oxidation and heating can cause biodiesel to break down, adversely affecting performance. NIST’s “advanced distillation curve” method could accelerate and simplify testing of biodiesels, according to lead author Tom Bruno. (More)

“We’re investigating an issue with Microsoft Teams impacting Europe and Asia”, an official Microsoft account tweeted.
“We’ve confirmed that this issue affects users globally. We’re reviewing monitoring telemetry and recent changes to isolate the source of the issue.”
Users around the globe have reported log-in and server issues, while social media commentators have reported problems with the desktop app, on both Windows 10 and MacOS, as well as the browser version of the video-conferencing tool.
According to DownDetector, users began reporting issues at around 9.30 am, with a spike of disruption reports registered at around noon.
Moments ago, Microsoft said: “We’ve identified the root cause and performed mitigation actions. We’re seeing signs of recovery and will continue to monitor the service. Users still experiencing impact should restart their clients to expedite recovery.”
Despite reports of the worldwide outage, not all users appear to have been impacted. Anecdotally, some users report that those who began the day already logged into their Microsoft Teams service found minimal disruption.

Below we’ll be covering most important aspects that have been discussed in this podcast episode.
Firstly, Rob and Nathan cover some of the common Contract Management nightmares they’ve seen over the years.
Common Contract Management Problems:
Contract management is an extremely important process in the procurement journey. When your contract is finally set up and you’ve made an agreement with your chosen supplier, your next big step is making sure that the contract is going to continue to be profitable in the future.
In one of their procurement advice blogs on Contract Management, Education Buying mention how important it is to maintain a healthy working relationship with your suppliers. Depending on the nature of your contract, it’s vital to have regular meetings where you can discuss the performance of the service and any issues that may arise throughout its duration.
Nathan backs up the importance of building a relationship: “the one that really bothers me is adversarial contract management. So what we’ve got to remember is that we deal with humans, people, and that contracts ultimately are relationships.”
Another way in which contract management can go wrong is by setting up the contract and then leaving it to gather dust, Nathan calls it ‘let and forget’:
“So, the hard work’s been done, we procured it, we’ve got a great supplier. We’ve got great prices, great terms, great quality. We’ve done a good job on our procurement, so we can forget about it now, and that, is a really bad example of contract management. Even the best procurement, you could run the most perfect procurement process in the world. It will still need managing, it still needs monitoring.”
While suppliers do need to be held accountable, as stated previously, contracts are ultimately a relationship between two parties, it’s a two-way street. We have mentioned this before but by leaving a contract unmonitored, it will lose value, guaranteed. On the topic of not monitoring contracts, Nathan adds his thoughts on ‘evergreen contracts’:
“So the other type of contract management is what we call evergreen contracts. And this is where a supplier basically, just keeps rolling over your contract. You’ve got no idea of where you stand in terms of the contractor ration, what terms you’re on, what prices are you meant to be paying, what you’re actually meant to be delivering, and what can sometimes happen is there’s a change of person within your organization.
Say, someone that was managing a contract has moved on, retired onto another job, and basically that contract has been either left or handed to someone who doesn’t really own it’ll take responsibility. What happens is in those cases, the supplier will manage it and the supplier will naturally manage it in a way that’s going to suit them and their outcomes.”
Evergreen contracts are a prime example of the problem with not monitoring your contracts effectively. By letting one party completely take over the process of contract management, they can take advantage of the situation without you even being aware of it until it is too late. There are situations where suppliers might take advantage of the situation, which can result in large costs that could be avoided.
Rob goes on to talk about some experiences he has had during his time in procurement. He mentions that in order to make sure your contracts are strong and going to be well managed, focus on it right from the start, because poor contract management can begin as soon as pen first touches paper:
“So poor contract management starts right at the start in understanding what it is you’re trying to buy and understanding what the value is in the contract, both yourselves and as the procurement person, as the person buying it. And also to the supplier. And I think the other side of contract management then, in terms of where it can fall down, is it engaging your wider stakeholders?”
By thinking about both parties when starting the procurement process, you can help yourself further down the line. Changing your contracts when they’re already established with a supplier is doable and suppliers will account for that change in requirements for example however, they will charge you. This is called Scope Creep.
A way to counter scope creep is through variation clauses in your contract. By agreeing beforehand on renegotiation prices through pre-agreed variation in your contracts, you can avoid agreement disputes. The question then becomes, whose terms did you sign up to? Was it your terms as the buyer, or was it the suppliers terms? Because depending on the answer, the price can change dramatically.
Overcommitment is another common problem to look out for, has a supplier stretched themselves too thin by overpromising you in order to win the contract? Nathan continues with the responsibility that procurement teams have in managing suppliers:
“…as procurement people we often recognize is that we take responsibility, not just for ourselves, but we have to take responsibility for our suppliers as well, to a degree and make sure that they’re not getting into contract situations, which they can’t handle now. And that comes back to how well that procurement has been undertaken and how well you’ve evaluated suppliers.”
The responsibility of a procurement professional is first and foremost, ensuring they deliver best value for money contracts to their clients, without compromising on the quality of the products or services delivered by their suppliers. It’s something 2buy2 takes very seriously and if you have found that when reading through these problems seem far too relatable – don’t hesitate to contact us, we are here to help.
The Biggest Costs of Poor Contract Management:
Our trio have covered some of the common problems in contract management, the next logical step would be how these problems can cost you. While money seems like the obvious factor, Rob brings another equally important area that you need to be aware of; “I think it’s certainly time, the amount of time that can be taken up, not just with the person doing the procurement, but within an organisation as a result of poor procurement.”
Time is a vital resource in procurement not only for the fact that once it’s gone, it’s never coming back. Missing an opportunity that could’ve saved your organisation due to mismanagement of time is a very difficult problem to come back from.
One of the more damning costs can be reputational, this goes for both supplier and organisation. Rob tells a story about a time when he had to procure blankets when he was working for an emergency procurement charity:
Using this example, there was a potential for massive reputational damage to the organisation if those had gone out in their unintended state. It would’ve not only harmed the organisation reputation, but the suppliers as well.
From poor quality comes poor reputation.
Linking with reputational damage is also then legal trouble. As Rob goes on to say: “…if you suddenly are producing a product and the quality of it drops off and you don’t manage that well, then you can end up with legal challenges and legal issues as a result of that.”
Sometimes though, you won’t even be aware there is an issue until further down the line, when an end-user or customer flags it as a problem, that’s when monetary costs come into play. If there has been an issue with the service to the point where an end-user has flagged it, Nathan states “it’s probably been happening for a while…”. So, what are the next steps to take?
Typically, you would need to bring in the supplier, evaluate what the problems are and where they could’ve come from. Before that, it is critical to ensure you have the facts before any other steps are taken. These two key facts are:
- What went wrong?
- How did it go wrong?
After that you can start to look at how to fix the issue, just know, money will need to be spent.
Nathan mentions that the cost of rework can be extensive depending on the sector:
“…the cost of rework in some of my previous examples have been in the construction world where we’ve done contracts for quite large capital building projects. The cost of rework can be extensive if a contract hasn’t been managed well, if a contractor has been merrily carrying on, based on the specification interpretation. Which isn’t quite correct, sometimes the cost of putting that right can be extensive. And then you get into the wrangle of, well, who’s responsible for that.”
Responsibility, depending on the severity of the cost of rework can also then become a legal issue, which can then turn into relational difficulties and by that point your problem has spiralled, and it can feel doomed. So how do you avoid it?
“So, the simple thing is managing the contract from the start. Understand what are the risks and that’s one of the key points I hear with every procurement you’ve got to set out from the start, what’s the risks, what could go wrong? What are the things that could fail? And have we addressed that in either the specification or the contract terms or as part of the evaluation of suppliers.”
Cover all bases from the start and you’ll be clearing those hurdles instead of fumbling at the first jump.
Unfortunately, sometimes poor contracts management can come from a change in environment rather than something directly related to your contract. We’ve all had to manage through a turbulent 18 months and while a lot of businesses have managed to remain profitable, even growing their profits in some cases, their core business may have dramatically changed during that process.
One of the ways you can make sure you won’t be completely blindsided by outside circumstances is through constant evaluation and re-evaluation of your supplier, find out if they are in a good financial situation? Are they relying on you for your contracts? If so, that could cause issues if you wanted to pull away.
But what would happen if there was no contract in place and issues started to crop up?
How to Avoid Problems when No Contract is in Place:
Nathan starts by considering the fact that you may be in a contract, you just weren’t made aware, “I’d be surprised if there wasn’t a contract. And the reason I say that is because when you think there isn’t a contract, often it will be the suppliers contract. And you’ve possibly just overlooked that. Or you’ve not realised that actually what you signed by way of a delivery notes.”
There is a risk attached to being unaware that you are signed into a binding contract and while we hope that suppliers are going to conduct themselves fairly within a contractual relationship, that isn’t always the case.
The fact that these contracts exist is to put in place an assurance of an outcome that you are spending money on. It is a value for money assurance, one to make sure you get what you are paying for and that you are protected from certain issues if they arise.
Nathan brings up evergreen contracts and long-term business partners:
“…the likelihood is that somewhere down the line – and we talked about evergreen contracts – or those that have may have been with a supplier for 10, 15 years, you may have worked with that account manager and he’s a lovely guy. And that’s absolutely fine, but you may not realize that for that entire time, there’s been a point in time where some terms and conditions have unloaded on someone’s desk and to get it off the desk, someone has just gone, oh yeah, it’s this supplier. We’ll just sign it, great off we go.”
Nathan likens it to a mobile contract, immediately scrolling through the terms and conditions to click accept just to get what you need straight away. For your key spends, it is vital that you take the time to understand what contract is underpinning that and if you aren’t sure, talk to your supplier and ask them as soon as possible.
There are far too many risks involved with staying in the dark on your contracts because if you are not happy with the delivery of a key spend, you will not be able to talk with your supplier about exit strategies or negotiations.
Sometimes both big and small organisations lose track of a contract, that can happen far too easily when you are also juggling other work. A great way to solve that is through using a Contracts Register to hold all of your contracts in one place. You can track all of your contracts spend, get notified of their expiration dates and benchmark spend to ensure your contracts are as efficient as they can be.
If you would like to get access to our free contracts register, click here and one of our procurement specialists will be in touch with a free demo.
Rob goes on to mention the battle of the forms and how that can lead to contract signing:
“…this is a classic thing called the battle of the forms, which is a procurement thing where in negotiation, you’re going back and forth and you’re given your terms and conditions. And the supplier has given their terms and conditions. And you basically bat it out to work out which ones win, and which ones apply. And usually, if it’s something significant, there’s some degree of negotiation and discussion over them.
But when that happens, you’ve got that clarity. If that hasn’t happened, then as Nathan said, they will be delivering those products. And when they deliver them, you’ll be signing a delivery note and in that delivery note signature, it’ll say, you accept our terms and conditions.”
Essentially, a contract is 9 times out of 10, in place whether you are aware of it or not. If you are unaware of some of your contracts, speak to the supplier delivering your products or services and ask them for the most recent copy of the contract. It is always better to engage with your supplier and continue to build the relationship than not engage with them at all and risk losing money and efficiencies.
How can you reduce or stop your contracts from leaking value?
Maintaining visibility across all of your contracts is the most important first step, how will you be able to stop them from leaking value if you aren’t monitored in the first place?
This is another key area that the contracts register can come into play. By tracking the start date, end date, spend, and categories, you’ll be in a really good position to reduce your contracts from leaking value. After mapping those contracts out, you can start to look at how effectively each contract is managed. You can look for differences such as:
- Whose terms are they on?
- When was the last time you met with suppliers?
- Which is the biggest spend area?
- Which has the biggest risk?
You have to remember to be proportional though, it is impossible to meet with all of your suppliers every week. Prioritise your most important contracts first and assess if they are covered across all aspects and meet with those suppliers.
Rob then states the importance of supplier management and how procurement is a link between organisation and supplier. From this, he goes on to mention:
“I think in terms of reducing and stopping contracts leaking value continual engagement with your internal customer, your internal stakeholder is crucial, what’s working? what’s not working? Why is it working? Why is that working better now than it was? Can we do more of that? Can we work with a supplier to enable them to do more of that? How can the supply add value to your internal customers, or product that they’re trying to produce, and really just acting as that kind of liaison between the two, I think is really important.”
By failing to engage with suppliers and internal stakeholders, you’re falling into the common let and forget problem that we previously spoke about. Be proactive in your contract management, never let an opportunity pass you by, even create your own opportunities. As soon as you become more reactive than proactive, you’re let the balance shift further out of your favour.
Overall, contract management is a vital process that can lead to your contracts working for you, or against you. Be sure to avoid the common pitfalls of contracts management and take the time to recognise what contracts you are in. If you are unsure, contact your supplier and find out.
To stop your contracts from leaking, use a contracts register and continue to evaluate your contracts and asses the risks. Be proactive in your procurement, work with suppliers and internal stakeholders to make sure to commit to your contracts for the long term!

"Paul McPharlin and the Puppet Theater (Paperback)
Paul McPharlin is one of the 20th century's most important contributors to the art of puppetry. Over a period of nine years he created some 20 productions with marionettes, rod puppets, hand puppets and shadow figures. He was also a prolific writer whose technical, theoretical and historical works contributed significantly to a puppetry revival. His book The Puppet Theatre in America is considered the definitive history of American puppetry. Though shy and aloof, McPharlin was also energetic. He had an ability to bring people together and used this knack to found a national puppetry organization, Puppeteers of America.
Besides the author's extensive research on McPharlin and puppetry, the book draws on significant contributions from McPharlin's wife, puppeteer and author Marjorie Batchelder McPharlin, who allowed the use of her 18-year correspondence with Paul in the creation of the book. Chapters take the reader through McPharlin's childhood as a loner in Detroit, his maturation and education in New York, and his early, erratic and often unsuccessful attempts at making a living. His puppeteering years, 1929 to 1937, are detailed, as are the later years that saw him first working for the WPA and then being drafted into the army to serve in World War II at age 38. He continued making important contributions to the art of puppetry until a brain tumor took his life at age 45 in 1948.
Appendices present two of McPharlin's plays, The Barn at Bethlehem: A Christmas Play and Punch's Circus. Another appendix details puppetry imprints, including yearbooks, plays, handbooks, worksheets and books. A fourth lists Paul McPharlin's Puppeteers, members of the Marionette Fellowship of Detroit.",<urn:uuid:dc0a065d-7057-4369-874a-c9f2669943b2>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://2fwww.politics-prose.com/book/9780786424337,2024-02-20T23:06:14Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9679712057113647,388,1.9848148822784424,2

"Terrace Marshall Jr. Quit…Because LSU Sucks
Maybe the most surprising thing about the announcement that LSU wide receiver Terrace Marshall Jr is leaving the Tigers team is the reaction - or, rather, lack of - coming from the state's legions of die hard Purple and Gold faithful.
Marshall, who Sunday told one and all that he is taking advantage of the NCAA's ""opt-out"" COVID clause, will certainly be one of the most coveted receivers in the NFL draft next spring.
But why did Marshall decide, seven games into the year, to up and quit? It's a move that he, without a doubt, wouldn't have made if the Tigers were undefeated and in the hunt for another SEC or national championship.
Nope. The reason - and it's probably a wise one - that Marshall is abandoning Baton Rouge with games left to play is...because his team sucks.
it's been a disappointing season for Coach Ed Orgeron's boys and Marshall can see the (golden) writing the wall. Why stick around two or three more games and risk getting hurt? Why run those pass patterns for another few weeks when there's nobody at quarterback who can throw a decent ball? Why give-it-all-you-got when all you'll probably get is sorry statistics that can only hurt your standing in the eyes of NFL scouts?
There's no question, from a financial standpoint, that Parkway High grad Marshall is making the right choice. But what is more than a little surprising is the indifference - no, make that understanding - that he's receiving from so many Bengal backers across the state.
But, on the other hand, when you have so many Tigers fans who are, every season, ready to give up on their team after one or two losses, why is it a shock that they don't care if their best player decides to pack it in after four?",<urn:uuid:50155fa1-432e-4f1d-a3d5-5b0bb7cc5bfa>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://710keel.com/terrace-marshall-jr-quit-because-lsu-sucks/,2024-02-20T23:33:54Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9753245711326599,389,0.6236918568611145,1

This was the problem Brisbane entrepreneur Emily Bitkow set out to solve and it didn’t take her long to develop a very stylish one.
She created the VIVRA, a magnetic pouch that slips over your waist band and has room for all your little essentials.
Designed to allow you to walk, run, dance, and move freely and hands-free, it’s more comfortable than a traditional bum bag with a tight strap and it still fits the same amount in.
Partnering with friend, Sarah Hua, the duo launched the VIVRA online and are receiving rave reviews from their customers.
“Absolutely love mine!” said one.
“I hated holding my bloody phone. I’ve tried arm bands and hated it. My phone was too big for them. I ordered the large size and can fit my Samsung s20 plus in there with my key and money comfortably. It’s like an old school bum bag without looking like one as these are way more compact... The magnets as really strong too. Highly recommend!”
“Hands down my favourite purchase of the year,” said another.
“Sleek but subtle, amazing quality, easy to use — have been recommending mine to everyone! I bought the Vivra Base - PB and it has made my walks so much easier and fuss-free. Thank you!”
The VIVRA comes in a range of colours, sizes and styles but all can be worn in five different ways including with a strap, as a shoulder bag, on the waistband, as a clutch/travel wallet, or with a chain, like a traditional bum bag.
The pouches are also water resistant and use RFID-blocking fabric to protect your cards from being skimmed.
For a limited time only, you can use the code STYLE20 for 20 per cent off.
Wheelchair users have applauded the versatile, hand-free pouches as well as runners and women who just want to be stylish.
“As a wheelchair user I don’t often have a free hand to spare,” said one review.
“My Vivra pouch gives me an easy safe and style way to hold phone and wallets along with odd hair tie and coin when I’m out and about.”
The quality is amazing... It can be hidden under a loose top or shown off, which I like. I can transfer from my chair to the car and not worry about dropping my iPhone too . Also great to hide my dogs treats in too.”

"Sun, Feb 11, 2024 12:45 PM
By Bethany Blankley, The Center Square
Within days of joining Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and a coalition of Republican governors in Eagle Pass, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and state legislative leaders announced their united agreement to fund and send troops to Texas.
While in Texas, after meeting with Abbott, Landry immediately called legislative leaders to express the need to fund sending Louisiana National Guard troops to Texas. On Thursday, they delivered, announcing in a news conference that they were allocating $3 million to send 150 troops to Texas to support Abbott’s border security mission, Operation Lone Star.
At the event, Abbott explained how combined state border security efforts have successfully blocked illegal entry, and they were expanding their efforts to other areas.
“Half of the governors of the United States have joined with Texas in our cause to make sure states should do everything possible to secure our border,” Abbott said. “We are here to send a loud and clear message that we are banding together to fight to ensure that we will be able to maintain our constitutional guarantee that states will be able to defend against any type of imminent danger or an invasion that has been threatened by Joe Biden and his abject refusal to enforce the immigration laws of the United States of America.”
Just days later, Landry shared some insight from his briefing with Abbott, who “explained to us that 30,000 pounds of fentanyl was seized at the border in Texas. That's enough to kill almost everyone in the country. So, this is an absolute emergency.”
President Joe Biden’s “open border policies,” Landry said, have created a fentanyl crisis that is killing 125,000 Americans every year.
Landry also described what he saw in Eagle Pass, referring to two bridges and two ports of entry, enabling people to legally cross from Mexico to Texas, which are manned by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in Eagle Pass.
“But what the president has done is basically dog whistle to those who have tried to come into the country illegally and say, ‘listen if you just swim across the Rio Grande, we'll let you in that way.’ Then all of a sudden you start to see 5,000 and 6,000 people having to swim across the Rio Grande to get into the country illegally,” Landry said. This puts pressure on Texas, “which eventually puts pressure on Louisiana and other states around the country.”
“Texas has always been a great neighbor to us,” Landry continued. “If they're calling, we should heed that call,” adding that legislative leaders “all agreed that we should do that.”
“Because the federal government will not act, because the president will not do his job, because Congress refuses to put in place a solid immigration plan that protects this country and allows people to come in and out of this country the way it has been done since the beginning, then the states are going to act,” he said.
A former active-duty National Guardsman, Landry said the money was well spent and “serves a purpose in helping Louisiana” to provide training and troop readiness. He also said Louisiana cities were combating crime being committed by cartel-affiliated “gangs of undocumented people” and Louisianans are dying from fentanyl poisoning. Crimes “we can directly trace to a border that is wide open that is letting the cartel do as they please into this country.”
Louisiana’s legislative leaders agreeing to send troops to Texas, he said, “is one of the most proudest days I can even ever have imagined to see all these great men and women here who are dedicated to public safety and to the security not only of the state of Louisiana but of the nation.”
Brigadier General Michael Greer, director of the Louisiana Military Department, said troops will be supporting the Texas National Guard “in what they're doing at the border.” Troops are currently expanding and building concertina wire and other border barriers as well as building Texas’ own border wall, The Center Square has previously reported.
Louisiana troops will not detain any illegal border crossers they encounter, Greer said, but will refer them “to local law enforcement who have the responsibility to make those arrests or do whatever it is under Texas law.”
Troops will begin to be deployed next month in three 50-troop rotations for 90-day deployments.
In response to Abbott’s call for help, 25 Republican governors have pledged their support and committed to send National Guard troops to Texas. Troops from 14 states have already been serving in Texas. Many governors last week said they would soon be sending more troops.
Texas border czar Mike Banks told The Center Square their efforts are working. Compared to a year ago, “if you look at the number of illegal border crossings today, Texas counts for 30% of those crossings. The remaining 70% are crossing in Arizona, California, and New Mexico. Why? Because they're not putting up the resistance that Texas is.”
“As Texas gains control of an area,” Banks said, “we're going to maintain that area and we're going to expand. We're going to gain, maintain, expand. We're going to cut off illegal entry into the state of Texas.”",<urn:uuid:0b8a8b60-75aa-4ff3-9e10-e63afb1903c9>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://930amtheanswer.com/news/regional/article_b32dd64a-c90d-11ee-b695-1b67f60757eb,2024-02-20T21:36:14Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.974956750869751,1137,0.8187779188156128,1
"Windsor Elementary Awarded Bicentennial STEM Fusion Curriculum
More than 100 Illinois schools applied for the 25 Fusion programs, one school in the Harlem District was lucky enough to get one!
Governor Rauer revealed the list of schools on Tuesday that will be receiving the three-year Bicentennial STEM Fusion Program.
Windsor Elementary in Loves Park was one of the schools who will be receiving the honor of the math and science program.
According to illinois200.com, the Bicentennial STEM Fusion Program is:
""The Illinois Math and Science Academy (IMSA) Fusion Program is a teacher professional development and student STEM enrichment program for Illinois students who are talented, interested and motivated in mathematics and science. IMSA Fusion places a special emphasis on students who are historically underrepresented in those areas. Fusion works with teachers and students in grades 4-8.
Even though more than 100 schools applied only 25 Fusion programs were awarded. However, seventy other schools that have qualified will be getting a one-year curriculum.
Gov. Rauner said on Tuesday to those who were attending the list's reveal at Dubois Elementary School in Springfield:
“Educating our young and preparing them for work are endeavors that are bipartisan. Through this program, the Bicentennial is helping us see what we have in common. STEM Fusion from IMSA represents a unique asset that Illinois is applying to help encourage children set out on a path to the 21st century workforce.”
Mystateline.com has the full list of all 25 schools who will be getting the Bicentennial STEM Fusion Program.
I just happen to know one Windsor student who just happens to be a budding scientist, that's really pumped about this program coming to her school!

"CMA Nominee Carly Pearce: ‘I Wanna Go Down in Country Music History’
CMA Awards New Artist of the Year nominee Carly Pearce has never wavered in the kind of music she wants to make: Since she was a child, she has been a die-hard country music fan who watched the awards show each year. Now that she's nominated -- for four trophies, nonetheless -- Pearce says she's more driven than ever to keep carving out her place in the genre.
""All I'm trying to do is tell my stories and share my truths, and I feel like because I have a microphone, it's my duty to really tap into authenticity,"" the singer explained in a video leading up to the 2019 CMA Awards ceremony, at which Pearce was nominated for New Artist of the Year.
""I've grown up watching the show. I've dreamt of what it would be like to win,"" she continued. ""So many people who win New Artist of the Year go on to be the spearheads of the genre. It feels like I've arrived in a lot of ways, just in myself and in the music that I'm creating ... There was just this sense of knowing who you are, knowing where you're going, knowing the kind of music, the kind of artist, the kind of narrative you wanna write -- the kind of story that I wanna write.""
Pearce's 2019 CMA New Artist of the Year nomination was her first ever at the annual awards show. In February, she released her sophomore album, a self-titled project led by ""I Hope You're Happy Now,"" a collaboration with Lee Brice. That song earned Pearce Song of the Year, Musical Event of the Year and Music Video of the Year nominations at the 2020 CMA Awards, and she's also up for New Artist of the Year for a second year in a row.
The 2020 CMA Awards are scheduled to take place on Nov. 11 and will air live from Nashville on ABC beginning at 8PM ET. Due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, the show will be hosted at Nashville's Music City Center, not Bridgestone Arena as is customary, and there will be no live audience.

"Woman’s Bat-Attack Backfires – Man Lazily Attempts to Break-Up Fight as He Eats Sandwich
The internet is reacting to a viral video that shows an altercation between two individuals. As one woman approaches the other and attempts to hit her with a bat, the attack quickly backfires. Meanwhile, a man gives a half-hearted effort to break up the altercation as he carries on eating a sandwich.
***WARNING - NSFW***
While it is unclear as to what exactly led up to this altercation, is was immediately clear from the video that these two individuals were not happy with each other. As one woman approaches with a baseball bat in hand, the other woman questions her use of the weapon. Unfortunately for the woman wielding the bat, the weapon would prove to be ineffective.
As the woman who initially swung the bat ended up on the ground in a no-win position, a man calmly walks into the frame of the camera. He can be seen eating a sandwich as he makes a half-hearted attempt at breaking up the skirmish.
The man eventually gives up his efforts to stop the fight and walks away as he continues to eat his sandwich.

"On Tuesday morning, ground was broken for the multimillion-dollar expansion of the Mississippi Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Newton.
The $3,628,930 project, which is being funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Cemetery Administration (NCA), will include the construction of 1,500 pre-placed crypts across five acres.
“We just broke ground this week on a $3.6 million expansion” Mississippi Veterans Affairs Executive Director Stacey Pickering said. “We’ve already got over 1,100 veterans and their family members buried there. Every veteran is entitled to two burial slots, and it looks just like Arlington National Cemetery.”
According to a previous statement from the VA, the NCA will continue to do everything they can for Mississippi’s 200,000 veterans.
“Our state partners are critical in helping NCA achieve our strategic goal of making sure veterans and their family members have burial options when needed,” Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Memorial Affairs Randy Reeves said. “We will continue to work with and support states such as Mississippi to provide grants that reflect the needs, resources, and preferences of the local veteran community.”
The cemetery expansion is scheduled to wrap up within 8 to 12 months.

"The recent protests across the country and the state, stemming from the death of George Floyd, have reignited the debate over the design of Mississippi’s flag.
As the only state flag to carry the Confederate battle emblem, calls for change have strengthened as conversations surrounding race and equality have come to the forefront. During his daily press briefing, Governor Tate Reeves was asked about his stance on the state flag, a question he was frequently asked during the 2019 election cycle.
“My position has not changed. I spent much of 2019 telling the people of this state what I believe, and that is there is going to come a time, at some point I’m sure, in which the people of Mississippi are going to want to change the flag. My position is that when they want to do that, it should be the people who make that decision, not some backroom deal by a bunch of politicians in Jackson,” he said.
Governor Reeves went on to say that the events of the past few weeks have “justifiably” led to increased discussions around the flag and many other issues. In 2001, Mississippians voted 64%-36% in favor of the current design, which was adopted in 1894, but the Governor acknowledged that a lot has changed since that vote took place.
“Make no mistake, I think that there is no doubt that over the last several weeks that there are people who are coming to a different conclusion than they came to in 2001. There are some that are coming to a different conclusion than they came to a year,” Reeves said.
Governor Reeves chose not to directly answer questions regarding his personal opinion of the flag’s design.
A new vote could take place through a ballot initiative, which requires over 105,000 signatures, or the legislature could vote to place the issue on the ballot. If that were to happen, Governor Reeves said that he “would not stand in [the legislature’s] way”.
As previously mentioned, the discussions regarding the potential of a new state flag for Mississippi is not new. The “Stennis Flag” has emerged as a popular alternative. Designed by artist Laurin Stennis, the granddaughter of the late former U.S. Senator John Stennis, the flag features 19 stars in a circle around a large center star with a red stripe on either side — signifying Mississippi’s ratification as the 20th state in the US.
“The overarching theme is unity and what we share,” Stennis said in June 2019. “Now we can be divided about a lot of things and those two red bars that are in opposition to one another represents that conflict, when it is done in a healthy way, is fine We don’t have to be Pollyannaish and pretend that we all agree on everything, but that red color also symbolizes Mississippians who gave their lives fighting for liberty and justice for all.”
A recent poll issued by State Senator Brice Wiggins, a Republican from Jackson County, received over 6,700 votes with overwhelming support for the new design.
The Stennis flag is available on specialty license plates with the proceeds going toward the Mississippi Civil Rights and History Museums.

"“[Bitcoin] is all based on the Great Fools Theory,” Belfort says in a recent YouTube video. “I know this better than anyone in the world. I’m not proud of that, but I do.”
Belfort says bitcoin’s price surges are thanks only to a belief by buyers that there will continue to be ‘greater fools’ who they can sell the asset to at a higher price.
“There’s no fundamental value [with bitcoin], it’s all based on the next guy and the next guy,” he says. “Get out if you don’t want to lose all of your money because … there’s a very good chance it’s going to crack. And when it really cracks, you’re not going to be able to sell on the way down, there will be no liquidity.”
The Greater Fools Theory is an idea Belfort himself profited from at Stratton Oakmont.
He served 22 months in a California prison after pleading guilty in 1999 to a seven-year scheme at his Long Island brokerage, Stratton Oakmont, whichmanipulated the price of stocks and left investors holding nearly worthless securities. According to Belfort, that experience has given him insight into a modern financial asset: Bitcoin.

"Mount Cook Heli-Hike
Jason Dundas loves the outdoors wherever he is, and New Zealand’s Mt Cook, just 3 hours from Queenstown, raised his pleasure a notch or two.
Mt Cook is 3,754 metres tall and has presented a challenge to many mountaineers, including Sir Edmund Hillary.
Jason visited Mt Cook National Park on New Zealand’s south island for his latest adventure which began with a helicopter flight taking him 1,200 metres above sea level to Tasman Glacier, the country’s largest glacier.
Jason met his guide Tex at the base and they spent around 30 minutes putting on the supplied gear – everything from socks, boots, gloves and hats. They chatted about the trip to come as well as having a helicopter safety briefing.
By the way, Tex actually is from Texas. After studying in Australia he crossed The Pond to New Zealand for a visit and hasn’t left. That was over ten years ago and he can talk about the glacier non-stop. He is very experienced and extremely passionate.
Jason and Tex were dropped off for a couple of hours of walking and exploring New Zealand’s Mt Cook, known in the Maori language as Aoraki and steeped in Maori history and legend.
Wearing ice spikes on their feet, known as crampons and designed for glacier conditions, it was time to follow Tex as he used skills handed down from New Zealand’s mountain pioneers. The crampons bite into the ice as you trek on the gentle, undulating terrain of the highest peak in New Zealand’s Southern Alps.
The glacier crawls slowly down the side of Mt Cook. Made of such dense ice, glaciers move under their own weight. Tex told Jason that with the constant movement no one knows what to expect and that makes the experience even more enjoyable. Each climb is unique.
runnels, moulins and sinuous winding streamlets is something to behold.
The return flight gave a different perspective from the first flight. After having walked on the crisp, white glacier below, it somehow took on a whole new familiarity. It was as though it had become a new friend.
New Zealand’s Mt Cook, 3 hours from Queenstown.
The Adventurer Tasman Glacier Heli Hike is $518 per person. It includes two scenic flights, guide and snow gear. The hike season runs between September & May.

"The person you marry is one of the most very important choices your is ever going to create. It can alter the course of yourself, to make it makes they both a tiny preference out of paradise, or a good foretaste of hell. Who you ily, impacting your household as well as your own kids’ college students. Performed I speak about it’s one of the most extremely important decisions you are going to build? Believe me, you want to marry the right lady.
Marrying ideal person isn’t an issue of options, however. It can help to know what you are interested in. Here are my personal suggestions about the fresh new properties to look for inside the a partner.
What you should see
step 1. Mutual trust – I was expected before on the even if an effective Catholic is to marry a low-Catholic. Brand new quick response is one to, since the Church tolerates like marriage ceremonies, she never ever encourages them. None can i remind them. It’s unwise in order to intentionally decide to get married in order to individuals who perhaps not share your own believe. Performing this manage produce constant stress along the most rudimentary activities, particularly in which you attend chapel, the manner in which you improve and instruct family, otherwise moral choices for example using birth-control. Let alone the fact it would be strange akkurat her discussing an effective sacrament which have somebody who does not believe ent. (However, I actually do realize many, owing to issues for example reversions otherwise conversions fall into blended marriage ceremonies. Which is a totally different point.)
Marry Son, Area 4: What to Look for in a wife
Get a hold of someone who offers the newest Catholic faith. No matter what charming a woman is generally, a marriage is built towards the a first step toward shared values. Dont lay way too many barriers when it comes to a strong relationships- get married a great Catholic.
2. You could potentially talk all the time – My partner and i dated good way, therefore into bulk in our courtship, every we could manage is actually cam. And you will cam we performed. We could possibly frequently purchase 5 instances approximately to your cellular phone, discussing from us histories, to your fascination with youngsters, to your goals for future years.
While getting split up by the a beneficial thousand miles try humdrum from time to time, appearing right back, we’re thankful to the go out i spent observing both such an intense way. Relationship is not from the that have “fun” in the sense that it is never assume all restaurants schedules within sweet eating, trips towards movies, or loitering during the shopping mall. If that is all your valuable relationships lives includes, you’re in to possess an impolite wonder when you get hitched. Relationships is stuffed with of many silent minutes off company, authored mainly of speaking or being from inside the each other’s visibility. Enjoying so you’re able to converse with your spouse are a switch compound in a happy marriage.
If you find yourself dating somebody, try to do nothing but chat. Bundle some schedules that lead to help you dialogue. If talking when it comes to period of time seems strained and you may forced, that’s an adverse indication. But when you normally speak including you identified each other to possess years, you’re on best track.
3. She’s stunning – Immediately, I have to clarify you to being attractive doesn’t have anything to complete towards photoshopped activities toward covers from publications otherwise portrayed on mass media. That is a bogus better of charm, one which no lady normally measure so you can.
Just what exactly would I mean? I mean one to first your next spouse is beautiful inside. She can be an elegant lady, regarding the most exact sense of the word. When Scripture speaks from “the good thing about holiness,” its not these are something conceptual. Holiness practically helps make women even more breathtaking and you can glamorous (this is why brand new Virgin Mary is among the most gorgeous lady actually ever created). Pick a woman with a beautiful soul which is decorated with grace. Here is the particular charm which can never disappear.",<urn:uuid:b088db75-2000-42d8-8c8f-1b3d0f1772db>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://abiprayaubud.com/2023/11/25/wed-young-buck-area-4-what-to-look-for-in-a-spouse/,2024-02-20T22:03:55Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9636180996894836,877,0.9569565057754517,1
"Crypto Altcoins Are Outperforming With Bitcoin ‘Gravitating’ Toward $50,000 - BLOOMBERG
BY Bloomberg News
(Bloomberg) -- Smaller, lesser-known digital currencies are outperforming Bitcoin after the breathtaking surge by the market bellwether in recent weeks.
Cardano surged as much as 30% on Friday, while Solana gained about 8% and Avalanche increased 12%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin was up about 2% and Ether was down around 1%. Combined, the two largest tokens account for about 70% of crypto’s $1.6 trillion market capitalization.
“After the huge rallies Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen, it’s not a surprise that they’re taking a bit of a sideways breather,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. “However, the fact that these altcoins are rallying so strongly today tells me people have not lost any love for the overall asset class.”
Solana is among the blockchains competing with Ethereum, crypto’s key commercial highway, for a bigger share of digital-asset activity
Options traders have been loading up on bets that Bitcoin will surge to $50,000 by January, when many market observers expect the SEC to finally allow exchange-traded funds to directly hold the cryptocurrency.
“I expect the current uptrend to persist, with Bitcoin gravitating towards 50k, where options strikes are clustering,” said Teong Hng, CEO at crypto investment firm Satori Research.
Bitcoin has surged more than 60% since the middle of October, when speculation jumped that the Securities and Exchange Commission was on the verge of signing off on ETF applications from the likes of asset management powerhouse BlackRock. The token was trading at about $44,100 on Friday.
“Today’s Bitcoin price action shows that while it is sensitive to interest rate expectations, it’s not the primary driver,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. “Crypto traders have been increasingly bullish since it became clear that it’s a matter of when rather than if an ETF will be approved. Lower rates simply assist that move.”

"The recent net neutrality regulations issued by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has opened the floor for a number of debates regarding the use of the Internet, especially mobile Internet. While no one is too enthusiastic about the regulations, except perhaps a few consumers, companies providing mobile Internet services are very much in trouble due to these regulations. To some extent, both consumers and Internet service providers stand to lose after these regulations come into order.
Here are the top 10 ways in which net neutrality can affect mobile Internet, both in positive and negative ways:
The biggest advantage of the net neutrality is that it brings transparency to the mobile Internet structure. Whether it is the pricing or the browsing experience, everything is made transparent under the net neutrality regulation. This can make the browsing experience for customers better, providing them control over a lot of things.
With the net neutrality regulation, the discrimination between the businesses that are displayed over the internet search can be brought to an end since it restricts mobile Internet providers from blocking any legal content from appearing in a search.
3.Provide Consumers with More Options
Since all businesses have an equal opportunity to appear in the search, the consumers can have more options to choose from. Whether the business is more developed or is just a small one, the customers have an equal opportunity to access it.
Mobile Internet is far more private in use and therefore, the chances of misuse of these services especially in children are quite high. With the net neutrality regulation, parents can have a higher level of supervision about their kids’ browsing on their mobile.
5.Businesses Get Equal Chance to Success
With the net neutrality regulation, all businesses get an equal chance to promote their business online. With no limitations on the search results displayed, businesses can make themselves visible in front of consumers quite conveniently.
6.Gives Higher Control
After the net neutrality regulations are in order, consumers can get higher control over their browsing experience since they are not working with any restrictions. The type of businesses they select for their use depend on their own choice, not on what their mobile service providers want them to see.
Here come the disadvantages. Firstly, mobile Internet has limited bandwidth and too much content display without any filtering can make loading quite difficult. Limited bandwidth is one of the major reasons why mobile service providers are against the idea.
In order to meet with the bandwidth demands of consumers, the mobile service providers will have to increase their performance level resulting in higher charges. This increase in price, combined together with the already high mobile service charges can make it unaffordable for a lot of consumers, limiting them in their use of mobile internet.
9.Slowing Down Expansion
The limitations on the mobile service providers put forward due to the net neutrality regulation can slow down the growth of these services. This slowing down in service expansion can affect the performance level of these companies providing the consumers with an unfavorable browsing experience.
10.Slow Browsing for Customers
The limited bandwidth combined together with a large quantity of content can make browsing through mobile internet quite slower than usual. As the browsing speed gets slower, the customers can eventually get frustrated with their mobile services and switching to other providers.
Keeping in mind these different ways in which net neutrality can affect the mobile Internet and the associated experiences, it can be difficult to pass the verdict whether it is completely positive or negative. Depending on the way it is used, net neutrality can be both beneficial and disadvantageous for people.
Much of it depends on the mobile service you are getting. Some companies like AT&T are still breaching the net neutrality regulations.

Re-injuries are a frequent frustration for anyone playing sports. The temptation to put your boots on after an injury is overwhelming. You’ve had your treatments, you’ve followed your rehab program and been given your recovery schedule, but feel that no-one knows your body better than you do and you want to return to play early. Not a good idea, according to a study on return to play research from the Football Research Group at Linkoping University in Sweden.
According to this study, injured footballers who missed a course of practice sessions before returning to full competition are more likely to aggravate their injuries – or even develop new ones – compared to those who were gradually eased in. And when it comes to the highest level of the game, professional matches have a seven-fold greater risk than practice ones for the returning player.
What Does The Research Suggest?
The research team examined data on 303,637 football matches involving Champions League teams, and that data included 4,805 matches involving players returning to the field after moderate-to-severe injuries kept them in the treatment room at least eight days.
Their results demonstrated that injury rate in the first match after return to play was increased by 87% compared with the average seasonal match injury rate. However, the study also discovered that with each practice session prior to the first match after an injury, players’ risk of another injury dropped by 7%. The same association was found for muscle injuries but not for non-muscle injuries.
The author states that the data suggests that if the injured player completes six training sessions after they have been the all clear by the medical team to fully participate in all team activities, but before they play a game, the risk of injury in that game is only marginally higher than the average risk in matches.
It should be noted that these results clearly demonstrate that rehabilitation alone may not be sufficient to prevent repeat injuries, due to the fact that most rehab procedures are conducted alone, away from the healthier members of the squad, and are no substitute for what they go through at the top of their game.",<urn:uuid:7d20a6d6-6c20-4f55-b840-515340327164>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://absolutehealthsolutions.com.au/more-training-reduces-risk-of-re-injury/,2024-02-20T21:42:58Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.976077675819397,437,2.29140567779541,2
"If you have a rental property, you already know how challenging it is to market it effectively. From signage to upgrades to digital marketing, there’s constantly something you can be doing or improving. No matter which aspect of marketing you are concerned with, search engine optimization plays a role. If you don’t get a handle on search engine optimization, or SEO, then all other aspects of your marketing approach are doomed to fail. Read on to learn 6 ways you can use search engine optimization to market your rental property.
What Is SEO?
Before we dive into what to do, let’s take a quick moment to define search engine optimization. Some of you are probably already familiar with the term and can skip down to the tips below. However, for many, search engine optimization is still a new and confusing topic. In brief, search engine optimization is a set of tools and best practices that help your website, business or, indeed, rental property, appear more prominently in search engine results. This is crucial for your marketing plan. You want your rental property to be the first one people find when they search for vacation homes in your area. The means for doing this are actually pretty straightforward and simple. Search engine optimization can be as simple as giving your website a sensible name or making sure you include information about the details of your property. If you are marketing online, having a website that includes all the relevant information about your property will often solve the problem of search engine optimization organically. Other important factors in search engine optimization include:
- Having a clear URL
- Writing a good website title and description
- Including content users will want to share
- Optimizing keywords
- Having strong UI
- Making sure search engines can find your website
- Including compelling content on your site
Now that you understand more about search engine optimization, let’s jump in to the tips and tricks for marketing.
1. Spruce Up the Property
Before you get online, make sure the physical property itself is as appealing as possible. If there is home repair or other work to be done on the property, start there before worrying about marketing. You can use local home builders and home repair workers to get quick approvals and faster turnaround times on repair work and upgrade. A fresh coat of paint can do wonders for your walls, as can things like porches, new furniture and updated appliances. While you’re at it, check things like pipe fittings, plumbing and electricity to ensure everything is in tip top shape. This might be a good time for you to take a close look at your property and ensure that every bolt and screw is in perfect working order. Don’t let it be a renter who finds a loose doorknob or creaky floorboard. As an added bonus, most of these upgrades look very appealing in pictures and can help with marketing your property online. Not all upgrades need to be large complicated projects, however. Something as simple as putting down a new rug to cover up an ugly floor can make a huge difference in the appeal of your rental property. Also consider changing out old, dull lighting to give your place a brighter, more friendly appearance. Other ideas for simple upgrades include:
- Painting furniture to make it look fresh
- Hanging curtains to change the look and feel of a room
- Adding temporary wall treatments like decals and removable wallpaper
- Adding things like pictures and art to the walls to make display walls more decorative
- Including a few hardy plants to add some fresh greenery to the property
2. Highlight Upgrades
So, you’ve made some upgrades, big and small. Scream about it! You’ve put in the hard work. Don’t be shy about telling potential renters about it in your rental listing. Even as you are doing all this upgrade work, make notes so you can include this information in your rental property listing later (though sooner is better, in this case). Remember: Upgrades are appealing. They tell potential renters that the people managing the property take good care of it and keep it in good shape. A pipe fitting or fixed floorboard might not sound like the most exciting upgrade, but it signals to renters that this property is in excellent condition, something they can’t necessarily see in photos. You are also marketing yourself in this process, and a property owner paying attention to those kinds of details is clearly a property owner who cares about the home and is keeping it in good condition. Speaking of photos, take pictures of all these upgrades as you make them. They make great marketing material when you update your property listing. Show off that fresh coat of paint or new artwork on the wall. Renters will want to walk into a home that looks like the photos they’ve seen, so definitely make sure your property photos are up to date as you’re making improvements. You don’t need to be a writer to highlight your upgrades. It doesn’t take flowery language and long descriptions. Simply describe the work you did and the improvements you made. Simple is better, in this case. A potential renter just wants to know the type of work that was done and why. Don’t get overly wordy. Simply say what you did and how it makes your property better. No matter what upgrades you’ve made, remember: Don’t be humble about them. Now is the time to sing your own praises and highlight all your hard work.
3. Mention Amenities
Look outside your property as well as within it when you’re marketing. Amenities, both at the property and outside it, can be a huge selling point. In fact, one of the most attractive amenities to potential renters is the location itself and not just the physical property. Sell the location! Talk about all the things that are nearby that you love to do. If there are conveniences within walking distance, such as grocery stores or restaurants, be sure to mention those. Renters will appreciate knowing that the location is just as appealing as the property itself. Other amenities are more specific to the property itself. This could be something as simple as in-unit laundry. That can be a big deal for renters. If you can provide something like in-unit laundry, don’t forget to mention it just because it is ordinary and routine to you. Some other amenities worth mentioning include things such as:
- Air conditioning or heat
- Outdoor spaces like yards or patios
- Hot tubs and pools
- Large windows
- Open floor plans
- Closet and storage space
- Availability of parking
- New or upgraded appliances
- Any other renovations you’ve made to the property
This is not an exhaustive list. Think about the particulars of your property. If you worry you are listing too many amenities – don’t! You can’t oversell the amenities that are part of your property. Potential renters will appreciate the other details. You never know what specific amenity might sell them on choosing your property in the end. All those amenities come with the added bonus of boosting your search engine optimization. If someone is looking for a specific feature, for example, they may search for amenity + location + rental property. Don’t miss out on getting to the top of those search results because you neglected to list an amenity. Every little bit helps!
4. Provide Suggestions for Local Attractions andActivities
While you’re discussing amenities, offer some suggestions for local attractions and activities. Not all amenities have to be practical. A lot of folks will be looking to rent for a vacation; they want to have a good time. So be sure to also provide some suggestions for things to do this weekend while they stay at your property. Some popular attractions and activities include things like concerts, cultural events, farmer’s markets, sports events and conventions. You never know what might bring someone to town, so be thorough when listing event and activities. A mini golf course might be a big draw for some, while a water park, nature hike or mall could appeal to others. Here are just a few ideas for events and activities worth listing:
- A science center or museum
- Music or dance classes
- Historical monuments and landmarks
- Public pools
- Outdoor activities like hiking, rafting or adventure parks
- Public gardens and greenhouses
- Biking trails
- Lakes and rivers with public access for boating, kayaking or swimming
- Shows like circus performances, concerts and plays
- Singles events
- Bars and clubs
- Tourist destinations
If you are struggling to come up with events and activities, check to see if your town or city has an events listing page or brochure of some sort. Particularly if you live in a place that gets a good amount of tourism, your local government may have already done the work for you in terms of listing events and activities.
5. Invest in Signage
Not all marketing needs to take place online. Word of mouth and good old physical signage can still do a lot for your marketing campaign. See if you can find local advertising agencies that might be able to advise you on custom sign design for advertising your property. They may also know the best places to put up a sign and the best times of the year to advertise. For example, there could be times when your town or city has a particularly high number of tourists visiting. A sign could plant the seed for a future rental. One of the biggest upsides of signage like this is that it is usually relatively cheap. You can just get a single sign to place on the property and it should last a long time. Plus, your neighbors, seeing that sign, may become some of your best advocates. They certainly don’t want bad renters coming to the neighborhood, so they may go on to recommend your property to friends and family whom they trust. Of course, there are a couple downsides. Because the signs are cheap and light, there is a real risk of theft. Luckily, they aren’t too terrible to replace, but if your signs are constantly being stolen, they may not be worth the investment. Signs listing a phone number can also lead to some spam calls that don’t have anything to do with your rental property.
6. Implement a Digital Marketing Campaign
Along with a physical marketing campaign, you should implement a digital marketing campaign for your rental property. Online is how most people find the things they want these days, and that definitely includes rental properties. If you are especially lucky, you may be able to find a local SEO company to help you with your digital marketing campaign. They can advise you on the ways to maximize your search engine optimization and make your content marketing as effective as possible. They also may be able to advise you on where your money and time is best spent. Most marketing companies (61%), have noticed that organic searches and improved SEO are a top property when it comes to a marketing campaign. With search engine optimization and digital marketing being so important, it can be hard to know where to start or feel overwhelming. That’s where something like a local SEO company could be a big help. Not everyone is equipped to comb through their website optimizing everything for search engines. SEO can include article creation, keyword creation, reformatting pages, adding metadata to images and much more. Having the help of an expert can definitely make this process easier. If you do want to do it yourself, take the time to learn about search engine optimization, as well as the best apps for real estate investors. Things like apps and tutorials can help you feel fully equipped to take on SEO yourself and get your rental property in front of the people who would be most interested in seeing it.
An Overall Marketing Campaign
All of this might sound like a lot, but you don’t need to use or implement every tip discussed here. Start small or with something you are familiar with. Maybe you are already a search engine optimization pro. Great! Start by optimizing your website. Or maybe you’d like to start by sprucing up your property or investing in physical signs. Wherever you feel comfortable starting, your rental property marketing campaign will benefit. http://mbawalls.com",<urn:uuid:485a87c3-e81f-40e2-9c98-5774be1fae26>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://absoluteseo.net/market-rental-property/,2024-02-20T23:20:52Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9469106197357178,2515,1.2311222553253174,1
"… the forest garden at Ayton takes shape.4
They say that Rome wasn’t built in a day – and neither is a Forest Garden. But it is also true that many hands make light work and with such a great team on the job the garden is really starting to take shape. It was really, really windy so the whole team deserve a massive round of applause for the effort today.
This week we have added posts to support the fruit trees and started to plant fruit bushes. While it will take a year or two for the trees to really start to produce fruit, we should get a decent amount of berries from the fruit bushes this year.
Herbs are fast growing and produce ground cover quickly, important on such a big plot of land. And, of course, they are delicious as additions to cooked dishes and delightful in salads. So we have built a herb spiral to get us started.

"In this paper, we present several baselines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for the two official written languages in Norway: Bokmål and Nynorsk. We compare the performance of models of varying sizes and pre-training approaches on multiple Norwegian speech datasets. Additionally, we measure the performance of these models against previous state-of-the-art ASR models, as well as on out-of-domain datasets. We improve the state of the art on the Norwegian Parliamentary Speech Corpus (NPSC) from a word error rate (WER) of 17.10% to 7.60%, with models achieving 5.81% for Bokmål and 11.54% for Nynorsk. We also discuss the challenges and potential solutions for further improving ASR models for Norwegian.
Indigenous language expertise is not encoded in written text in the same way as it is for languages that have a long literal tradition. In many cases it is, on the contrary, mostly conserved orally. Therefore the evaluation of neural MT systems solely based on an algorithm learning from written texts is not adequate to measure the quality of a system that is used by the language community. If extensively using tools based on a big amount of non-native language this can even contribute to language change in a way that is not desired by the language community. It can also pollute the internet with automatically created texts that outweigh native texts. We propose a manual evaluation method focusing on flow and content separately, and additionally we use existing rule-based NLP to evaluate other factors such as spelling, grammar and grammatical richness. Our main conclusion is that language expertise of a native speaker is necessary to properly evaluate a given system. We test the method by manually evaluating two neural MT tools for an indigenous low resource language. We present an experiment on two different neural translations to and from North Sámi, an indigenous language of North Europe.
The Norwegian Colossal Corpus: A Text Corpus for Training Large Norwegian Language Models
Javier de la Rosa
Proceedings of the Thirteenth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference
Norwegian has been one of many languages lacking sufficient available text to train quality language models. In an attempt to bridge this gap, we introduce the Norwegian Colossal Corpus (NCC), which comprises 49GB of clean Norwegian textual data containing over 7B words. The NCC is composed of different and varied sources, ranging from books and newspapers to government documents and public reports, showcasing the various uses of the Norwegian language in society. The corpus contains mainly Norwegian Bokmål and Norwegian Nynorsk. Each document in the corpus is tagged with metadata that enables the creation of sub-corpora for specific needs. Its structure makes it easy to combine with large web archives that for licensing reasons could not be distributed together with the NCC. By releasing this corpus openly to the public, we hope to foster the creation of both better Norwegian language models and multilingual language models with support for Norwegian.",<urn:uuid:6edde278-aa6d-4358-b616-681b06d91a3e>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://aclanthology.org/people/p/per-kummervold/,2024-02-20T22:17:49Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9339128732681274,607,1.9540168046951294,2
"If you are fascinated by the word “parallel” or “concurrent”, by the programs that run on supercomputers, by random jargons like “linearizable”, or anything high performant, then this is the guide you’re looking for!
In this guide, we lay down the pre-requisites and the foundational knowledge resources. Finally, we explain some interesting sub-fields in High-Performance Computing along with resources to get started in them.
High-Performance computing is a relatively tricky field to get into, mainly due to its pre-requisites. While this field is not math-heavy (assuming you’re not interested in scientific simulations), it requires you to have a decent grasp over Computer Architecture and Operating Systems concepts.
Computer Architecture is especially crucial if you’re tackling any optimization problem since your application requires you to employ as many hardware benefits as possible. So, before getting started with this field, we highly recommend reading Structured Computer Organization by A. Tannenbaum, T. Austin 6th Edition. A bare minimum is a reading of chapters 2, 3.3–3.6, 4.1, 4.4–4.6, 5.1, 5.4 and 5.5.
A course on Operating Systems introduces a student with the fundamentals of multiprocessing, after all, your PC can run chrome and code at the same time (but can it run Crysis?). Therefore, you must go through the basic concepts of OS. We recommend you read Chapters 1 and 2 of Modern Operating systems by A. Tannenbaum, H. Bos 4th Edition. Conversely, if you want to take a more traditional and detailed approach to OS, you can read Chapters 1–5 of Operation Systems Concepts by A. Silberschatz, P. B. Galvin, G. Gagne 10th Edition. We recommend you try out questions given in the book for practice.
If you don’t feel like going through the books (perhaps you don’t find books amusing?), we suggest you study the following broad topics that are of interest with respect to HPC:
- Micro-architecture: Data/Execution path, Pipelining, ALU design, Optimizations (Caching)
- ISA: Registers, memory model, addressing
- Architecture types: x86, ARM architecture (aarch)
- Miscellaneous: SIMD, MIMD, NUMA, Cache coherence
- Process, thread, fork/join, POSIX API, Race conditions, Mutual Exclusion
Finally, you must brush up your programming skills in C or C++. The field deals with significant amounts of code writing, so you can’t afford to get away with a hello world program.
Now that you are well acquainted with the pre-requisites, it is time to get into “the thing”. Before we start with the actual coding or subfields, we must go over the theory. Since the pre-requisites only introduce the notions of multiprocessing and threading, we now suggest you read Chapters 6–9 of Operation Systems Concepts by A. Silberschatz, P. B. Galvin, G. Gagne 10th Edition. These chapters will introduce you to the general concepts of parallel programming and synchronization problems. Make sure to try the coding problems at the end of each chapter.
Once you’ve read that, we recommend you to do the course CS 0368–4061–01 from MIT. The course is inspired by the book The Art of Multiprocessing by M. Herlihy, N. Shavit. The book teaches you the concepts of parallel programming along with the general concepts like linearizability and wait-freedom, to name a few. This book is especially important for anyone wanting to pursue any of the research problems mentioned in the book. Alternatively, you can go through the SPTCC 2017 lectures. They teach you all the fields relating to parallel and distributed computing broadly. It is not necessary (but recommended) to go through all the lectures to proceed further.
With all the theoretical work done, you can now begin with some coding.
It is finally time to learn parallel algorithms and implement them in your language of choice, and then optimize your codes for the underneath architecture. Start with a course on HPC. We recommend you go through the following course:
- LSU’s CSC 7600 by Prof. Thomas Sterling and Dr. Hartmut Kaiser: High Performance Computing: Models, Methods and Means (CSC 7600)
If you’re stuck anywhere within the course, we recommend reading more on the topic. For example, if you are having trouble understanding OpenMP, we suggest you go through its tutorials. If that’s not enough, you can find the documentation here. You can approach MPI the same way. You can find the tutorial and documentation here and here.
By this point, you should be familiar with Parallel and Distributed programming paradigms. If you’re interested in how operating systems are designed in distributed settings and the general concepts of distributed deadlocks, distributed clock synchronizations, distributed mutual exclusions, etc., then we suggest you give Advanced Concepts in Operating Systems by M. Singhal, N. G. Shivaratri, N. Shivaratri a read.
If you’ve gone through the course in-depth, you must have realized the inherent shortcomings of an OpenMP + MPI application. A lot of research is, therefore, done on runtimes. New parallel programming paradigms are on their way. Many are trying to optimize the more recent paradigms. If you are interested in working on runtimes, you will have to understand the addressing models employed by them. Some of the popular addressing models that we currently have are MPI, PGAS, and AGAS. You have already learned MPI, so let’s understand what PGAS and AGAS are.
- AGAS Paper: Hartmut Kaiser et al., HPX — A Task Based Programming Model in a Global Address Space, PGAS 2014: The 8th International Conference on Partitioned Global Address Space Programming Models (2014)
- PGAS Paper: Saraswat, Vijay, et al. “The Asynchronous Partitioned Global Address Space Model.” The First Workshop on Advances in Message Passing. 2010.
Several runtimes/languages/frameworks based on these models exist. It is usually recommended to have in-depth knowledge of one while knowing the existence of others. Feel free to pick any one of the runtimes/languages/frameworks of your choice. Some popular ones are:
- Habanero C
We’ve missed on a lot of frameworks, so if you find an interesting one, go ahead and give it a shot!
You can also go through the course CS315B by Stanford on programming supercomputers. Furthermore, Programming Models for Parallel Computing by P. Balaji is an excellent read if you want to learn about different programming models and how they differ in their functioning.
All hardware can fail. This can be a faulty floating-point operation, a bit-flipped memory fetch or a complete meltdown of a processor or other hardware component. In case of such errors, you do not want to rerun your 5-day long simulation. This is both a loss of time and resources. Fault-tolerance plays a crucial role in deciding “what to do” approach in case of such crashes. Unfortunately listing all papers is out of scope for this blog so the following papers are a good read on the topic.
- Coordinated checkpoint/restart process fault tolerance for MPI applications on HPC systems, by Hursey, Joshua, Ph.D., Indiana University, 2010, 202; 3423687 (for MPI)
- K. Teranishi et al., “ASC CSSE level 2 milestone #6362: Resilient asynchronous many-task programming model,” Sandia National Laboratories, Tech. Rep. SAND2018–9672, 2018. (for AMTs)
To get a detailed understanding of Fault-tolerance, you must read Fault-Tolerance Techniques for High-Performance Computing by T. Herault and Y. Robert.
Performance Modelling and Optimizations
So you finally learned some parallel programming paradigms and decided on the best one for your application. You go ahead and write your application with everything you know, but your application still performs poorly. How do you assess where you went wrong? Is it your fault? Is the hardware at fault?
If you find observing a high FLOPS count thrilling, this field will provide you with ample opportunities to turn a non-performant code to an exascale one. It is a good time to understand data parallelism employed by SIMD and learn some SIMD programming (also this). You may also want to look into SIMD libraries and presentations. For performance modelling, this workshop is a great place to start. You should also explore more based on the citations of the workshop presentations.
While there are multiple optimization problems to look at, one famous problem set is stencil codes. These codes are useful in solving a variety of linear differential equations. However, one flaw of stencil codes is their inherent memory-bound nature. This means that an application will not perform at CPU’s peak performance, bottlenecked by the memory bandwidth. Since memory bandwidth for DRAMs can’t increase significantly, it remains as an optimization problem. A good way to start with cracking stencil optimizations is to read the book Space-Filling Curves by M. Bader. For example, Chapel makes use of chapel iterators to perform diamond tiling (one such optimization) over a grid without loss in the visibility of stencil operation. C++ (OpenMP) brethren, however, fail to show such smooth transitions between the naive stencil and diamond-based tiling solutions and requires special compilers to do so. Such optimizations without loss in the overall code visibility are the key to this field.
Non-Blocking Algorithms & Data Structures
Traditionally and predominantly, locks have been used in parallel programming. Locks are used to synchronize threads/processes and prevent race conditions. Blocking can be undesirable, as it halts the thread’s progress, which can be an issue if the thread was performing a high priority task or real-time task. It reduces parallelism opportunities for the system. Blocking can also lead to conditions like deadlock and priority inversion.
Non-blocking data structures and algorithms provide many benefits over their synchronized counterparts, such as providing guarantees on liveness, which is a property on how threads make progress throughout a system. These properties in increasing order of the guarantees offered are:
- Obstruction-freedom, which states that threads are guaranteed to complete their operation so long as they are not obstructed by some other thread.
- Lock-freedom, which states that at least one thread is guaranteed to progress and succeed in a bounded number of steps.
- Wait-freedom, in which, all threads are guaranteed to progress and succeed in a bounded number of steps.
Non-blocking algorithms are a big research field. Researchers are exploring new non-blocking algorithms, as well as non-blocking variants of existing blocking algorithms and data structures. Achieving true lock-freedom is extremely difficult, and may not always be possible or feasible.
Some lock-free data structures are:
- Treiber’s Lock-free Stack: Hendler, Danny, Nir Shavit, and Lena Yerushalmi. “A scalable lock-free stack algorithm.” Proceedings of the sixteenth annual ACM symposium on Parallelism in algorithms and architectures. ACM, 2004.
- Michael & Scott’s Lock-free Queue: Michael, Maged M., and Michael L. Scott. Simple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent Queue Algorithms. No. TR-600. ROCHESTER UNIV NY DEPT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, 1995.
Networking Communications and Models
HPC is all about performance, and so, a high amount of research goes into improving the processing hardware and software. However, with the onset of Distributed Computing, most HPC applications are expected to run on clusters and supercomputers, which are a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together to achieve a common goal. Network bandwidth, therefore, limits the peak performance expected from a CPU. This led to the evolution of networking communication standards specifically for use in HPC. These feature extremely high throughput and low latency. Some examples are Cray Aries, Mellanox InfiniBand, Cray Gemini, Intel Omni-Path, etc.
Remote direct memory access (RDMA) is a direct memory access from the memory of one computer into that of another without involving either one’s operating system. This permits high-throughput, low-latency networking, which is especially useful in massively parallel computer clusters. You can read more about RDMA here.
Computational Science Library Backends
Ever felt that you should’ve chosen Astrophysics as a major? Or perhaps Math or Biology or Chemistry?
These fields are of interest to those who want to work in cross-disciplinary research. The simulations running on supercomputers come under computational sciences. These are codes that simulate a certain behaviour (eg: stellar mergers). Since most scientists don’t deal with the coding portions of simulations, you fill in the gap of understanding the science and programming it on the supercomputer. Some existing applications are:
- Octo-Tiger: Octo-Tiger is an astrophysics program simulating the evolution of star systems based on the fast multipole method on adaptive Octrees. Link: https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/octotiger
- FleCSI: FleCSI is a compile-time configurable framework designed to support multi-physics application development. Link: https://github.com/laristra/flecsi
- OpenAtom: OpenAtom is a software for studying atomic, molecular, and condensed phase materials systems based on quantum chemical principles. Link: http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/OpenAtom/

"In the world of athletic recovery and relaxation, Epsom salt has carved out a unique space. Renowned for its ability to soothe sore muscles and promote relaxation, it’s no wonder that Epsom salt is a staple in the wellness routines of athletes and fitness enthusiasts. The magic of Epsom salt lies in its composition: it’s a mineral compound of magnesium and sulfate, both of which are readily absorbed through the skin.
Active Releaf’s Innovative Approach
Active Releaf, understanding the therapeutic potential of Epsom salt and CBD oil, has developed a range of products that harness their benefits. Their bath bombs and salts combine the muscle-soothing properties of Epsom salt with the calming effects of CBD oil, providing a holistic approach to recovery and relaxation. These products are particularly beneficial for athletes looking for a natural way to aid recovery, or for anyone seeking a natural method to relieve stress and promote relaxation.
The Science Behind Epsom Salt
Magnesium, a key component of Epsom salt, plays a crucial role in over 300 enzyme reactions in the human body. It’s vital for muscle and nerve function, reducing inflammation, and improving blood flow and oxygenation. Sulfates, on the other hand, help flush toxins and form proteins in joints and brain tissue. When dissolved in warm water, Epsom salt breaks down into magnesium and sulfate and enters the body through the skin, offering a host of benefits.
Muscle Recovery and Epsom Salt
For athletes, muscle soreness is a familiar sensation. Intense workouts can lead to the buildup of lactic acid and other metabolic wastes in the muscles, causing stiffness and soreness. Epsom salt baths can help alleviate these symptoms. The magnesium in Epsom salt helps the body to use glucose and lactic acid more effectively, aiding in muscle recovery. Moreover, the warm water of the bath itself encourages muscle relaxation, further reducing soreness and stiffness.
Epsom Salt for General Relaxation
The benefits of Epsom salt extend beyond athletic recovery. Its muscle-relaxing properties make it a great tool for general relaxation and stress relief. In a world where stress and anxiety are prevalent, an Epsom salt bath can be a simple yet effective way to unwind. The warm water and magnesium can help relax the nervous system, reducing stress and promoting a sense of calm.
Combining Epsom Salt with CBD Oil for Enhanced Benefits
Integrating CBD oil into Epsom salt baths can amplify the relaxation and recovery benefits. CBD oil, derived from the hemp plant, is known for its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties. When combined with Epsom salt, it creates a synergistic effect that can help alleviate muscle pain, reduce inflammation, and enhance overall relaxation. Active Releaf’s bath bombs and salts incorporate this powerful combination, offering an enhanced bath experience.
The Role of Epsom Salt in a Holistic Wellness Routine
Incorporating Epsom salt into a holistic wellness routine can significantly enhance overall health and wellbeing. Regular Epsom salt baths can help maintain magnesium levels in the body, promoting muscle and nerve function, reducing inflammation, and improving sleep quality. When combined with other wellness practices like yoga, meditation, and a balanced diet, Epsom salt can play a vital role in maintaining a healthy, balanced lifestyle.
Practical Tips for Using Epsom Salt
To get the most out of Epsom salt baths, it’s important to use them correctly. A general guideline is to use about two cups of Epsom salt in a standard-sized bathtub filled with warm water. Soaking for at least 12 minutes is recommended, but longer soaks can provide additional benefits. For those with specific health conditions, consulting a healthcare provider before starting Epsom salt baths is advisable.
Epsom Salt as a Cornerstone of Wellness
Epsom salt, particularly when combined with CBD oil, offers a potent combination for athletic recovery and relaxation. As more individuals seek natural remedies for health and wellness, products like Active Releaf’s bath bombs and salts stand out for their innovative and holistic approach. Whether you’re an athlete looking to speed up recovery or someone seeking a natural way to unwind and de-stress, Epsom salt can be a valuable addition to your wellness routine. In embracing the benefits of Epsom salt and CBD oil, we can take a significant step towards a more natural, balanced approach to health and wellbeing.",<urn:uuid:bbe928d8-d880-4055-94a9-75d9560ab89d>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://activereleaf.co/active-releaf-epson-salts-athletes-companion-for-recovery,2024-02-20T21:14:59Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9271418452262878,913,1.6780729293823242,2

"Finest-5 Product reads #34
Difficulty of simple products, North star metric, etc..
Let’s start with DALL-E 2, one of the most interesting things I came to know about this week. This amazing product from OpenAI is just mind-blowing. And to know the way it works is just a treat to any engineer.
Uber has evolved from an old system of experimentation to a new one that is more generalised, scalable and trustful. The journey and parameters are complex, but important to understand.
Carefully constructing the building blocks of an A/B platform and ensuring the data collected is correct is critical to guaranteeing correctness of experiment results, but it’s easy to get wrong
Over the years, feature flagging has become the norm and the experimentation system became a required dependency for mobile apps and backend services.
At its core, an experiment comprises 3 key parts: randomization, treatment plan, logs
Great products hide their complexities well. On the surface, we see the user experience and know what the solution is capable of, but we cannot fully understand the work that went into creating the product or what’s powering it.
Finding the right balance is challenging, and too often we’re encouraged to ship something suboptimal just to get it out the door.
What sounds like simple logic for the user, ends up being a complex diagram of decision points for the company
When discussing complexity, we can talk about two types related to product development: the complexity for the company to build the product and the complexity for the user to use the product.
The name “One Metric That Matters”, sends the message that you only need to focus on one metric to build growth into your product. However, there are many caveats to it.
NSMs are output metrics, output metrics represent results and input metrics represent actions.
No metric exists in isolation. To truly understand how one metric impacts growth, you need to see its effects on other metrics downstream.
Select a constellation of a few key output metrics that capture the full dimensions of the business.
Amazon recently announced a “Buy with Prime” option. A pure play of how microservices will allow people to use prime membership off amazon’s website.
Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are: Highly maintainable and testable, Loosely coupled, Independently deployable, Organized around business capabilities, Owned by a small team.
Amazon has modularised this whole offering to enable other participating websites and apps to provide Prime member benefits to Amazon prime members
Amazon will slowly become a central model for many services through its built-up infrastructure. This will further reinforce the Amazonian Moat.
Scaling a product looks like a growth thing for most business owners. However, a major concern can be retention.
The best approach to excellent retention is to start with design and then optimize using analytics.
The 3 phases of retention:
Start: Onboarding and value (wow-moment) discovery
Middle: Habit creation and dormant user reactivation
End: Churn prediction and delay
To increase retention, some form of “lock-in” is added besides habit loops.

"Objective In England, the National Health Service commissioned a National Management Service for children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The aims of this study were to describe the health of children seen in this Service and compare lung function to children with cystic fibrosis (CF).
Design Multi-centre service evaluation of the English National Management PCD Service.
Setting Four nationally commissioned PCD centres in England.
Patients 333 children with PCD reviewed in the Service in 2015; lung function data were also compared with 2970 children with CF.
Results Median age at diagnosis for PCD was 2.6 years, significantly lower in children with situs inversus (1.0 vs 6.0 years, p<0.001). Compared with national data from the CF Registry, mean (SD) %predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 76.8% in PCD (n=240) and 85.0% in CF, and FEV1 was lower in children with PCD up to the age of 15 years. Approximately half of children had some hearing impairment, with 26% requiring hearing aids. Children with a lower body mass index (BMI) had lower FEV1 (p<0.001). One-third of children had positive respiratory cultures at review, 54% of these grew Haemophilus influenzae.
Conclusions We provide evidence that children with PCD in England have worse lung function than those with CF. Nutritional status should be considered in PCD management, as those with a lower BMI have significantly lower FEV1. Hearing impairment is common but seems to improve with age. Well-designed and powered randomised controlled trials on management of PCD are needed to inform best clinical practice.

"Four beauty trends for brands to look out for in 2023
As we head further into 2023, a keen observer can easily see which 2022 beauty trends are here to stay, which are not - and what new trends are emerging just now. It’s clear that the focus on eco-friendly products and brands is one of the trends that’s very likely to go well beyond 2023!
So, what other trends should brands look out for this year? Here are a few…
- Focus on wellness
‘One must suffer to be beautiful' is a phrase many girls will recall hearing growing up. Looking back, it was a grim outlook on beauty - that in order to achieve it, it was necessary to sacrifice well-being and sometimes health for time-consuming, painful and occassionally harmful beauty regimens.
The idea has since been challenged, and in 2023 it’s likely to be entirely overthrown: one of the strongest trends that have emerged so far as a newfound focus on wellness as well as beauty. Products are expected to not just make the user look better - it’s expected to also make them feel better and healthier in one fell swoop.
- Multi-use products
With Covid and lockdowns well behind us, people have things to do and places to be - and very little time to waste using three different products when one would serve just as well!
Multi-use products, such as tinted moisturizer with SPF that serves as foundation as well as moisturizing the skin and protecting it from UV radiation, are growing in popularity and are not likely to go anywhere anytime soon. Plus, they can save money, making them very attractive to anybody who wants to look good on a budget.
- Gender neutral beauty products
That of gender-neutral beauty products, created and marketed for the people of any gender identity, is another rising trend as more and more people are looking for inclusive and diverse options. With simple packaging and ingredients that fit a vast array of skin types, these products are versatile and likely to grow in importance as society looks to break down traditional gender norms and embrace individuality.
- 3D nail art
Beyond a simple manicure, nail art has become a staple of the beauty industry in recent years and 2023 is taking it to a new dimension - quite literally!

"Since launching our first Autodesk Forma capabilities into the market, I’ve been getting a lot of questions about naming. Specifically, the difference between the first set of Forma capabilities we have in-market and our future AECO industry cloud that we announced at Autodesk University in September 2022. I will explain by answering some of the questions we have received.
What is behind the Autodesk Forma name?
Autodesk Forma is a big, ambitious project to reimagine how the AECO industry works across all disciplines and phases of Building Information Modeling (BIM)–planning, design, construction, and operations. And Forma is not just for buildings, it will expand to address the infrastructure and water industries. As we build out Forma, you’ll hear us talking about our big vision for this industry cloud, while also talking about our in-market capabilities.
What is Autodesk’s approach to building out Forma?
Our plan is to expand Forma capabilities over time. This multi-year journey begins with building the data backbone necessary to support today’s customers using products like AutoCAD, Revit, and Civil3D, as well as those working with our commercial Autodesk Forma offering. We have already started on this journey with Autodesk Docs, which will be expanded with granular data capabilities and become the data backbone for Autodesk Forma.
As we build new Forma capabilities, we will focus on unlocking value and insights from project data. Our approach is focused on outcomes, of which sustainability is a priority, driving an open ecosystem via data and application APIs and removing complexity for the user. We will also connect our existing products to Autodesk Docs via our Autodesk AEC data model, enabling hybrid workflows across Forma, other Autodesk offerings, and third-party applications.
What is in-market for Autodesk Forma today?
Today, Autodesk Forma is a web application focused on planning and early-stage building and site design. It has its origins in Spacemaker and FormIt. The first set of capabilities targets the early-stage planning and design process with automations and AI-powered insights that:
- Ease project set up and offload repetitive tasks;
- Simplify the exploration of design concepts, making it possible to work with many different proposals at the same time; and
- Evaluate environmental qualities (like wind, microclimate, sunlight/daylight) surrounding a building site, giving architects time to focus on creative solutions.
We are already driving outcomes by leveraging AI/machine learning and granular data with this first release. Early and better access to contextual site data also leads to more sustainable and accurate outcomes.
Based on what is in-market today, is Forma just for architects?
No, Forma is not just for architects, but I can see how customers might assume that to be the case. While we are starting with workflows for architects, this is only the beginning of the breadth we need to cover the entire BIM process.
What does the in-market Forma capability tell me about the future Forma industry cloud?
There are attributes you will see in the current Forma capability that are key principles for the Forma industry cloud as well. A few of these are:
- Outcome focused: integrated analyses (driven by machine learning) provide decision support.
- Collaborative: easy to share work and collaborate in teams and with stakeholders.
- Open: customers and third parties can connect and extend Forma data and capabilities.
Why not call the in-market capability Forma Planning or Forma Concept or even something different than just Forma?
This was debated heavily and there was no perfect answer. With just one set of capabilities in the market, giving it a suffix felt redundant, especially while we are still trying to establish the Forma brand. However, not differentiating the name between the industry cloud and first set of capabilities might imply that Forma is limited. I have also heard from many customers that it is frustrating when we rename our products. So, we kept it simple and will expand the Forma naming framework as new capabilities get released.

"What is a Blog? A blog is an online journal that a writer can use to share his ideas, thoughts, expertise, or interests. A blog is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (“posts”). Blog posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Blogs are usually created by an individual or a small group and often talking about a single subject or a topic or a niche. A blog itself isn’t really a business—it’s more of a platform for other income streams.
Your content alone won’t likely make you money. A blog is constantly supplying potential customers and existing customers with interesting and useful content and the blog enables them to interact with the blogger and the discussions that they have together can be potentially unending. Not only can you and your customers have discussions but they can also ask questions that you can answer. Also, a blog provides a dimension to the content that you can’t get from your website content. Through your consistent and regular blog content, you will eventually be regarded as a subject matter expert in your niche and people will turn to you for answers.
This will promote more and more discussions. What is really being done in this case is that relationships are being developed and strengthened. Some of the people with whom you interact on your blog will never become your customers. That is perfectly acceptable. They can interact with you as much as they like and do not have to worry about any pressure to buy anything.

Blogs have a lot of useful features that are very helpful in promoting interactivity. Blogs enable visitors to subscribe to them so they can receive updates on a very regular basis. They will always be informed when new content is added or there has been some update to the social media profiles of the people with whom they interact.
In order to really be effective, blogs should have new postings at least once or twice a week. Fresh, original content is very important. The content is exactly what attracts and retains people and many of those people will eventually become customers. The true purpose of a blog is to provide helpful, valuable, informative, and interesting content that helps other people and that they find interesting. A blog’s purpose is definitely not to advertise or to do a hard sell on anyone. If you try to use your blog in that way, you will be very disappointed with the results.
You will not be able to build relationships with anyone and you most likely won’t sell very much. People don’t buy from people whom they don’t trust. The only way that they will trust you is if they get to know you. Almost everyone has a website. A good way to think about a website is in terms of it being a virtual store that sells products and/or services.",<urn:uuid:2d60c576-0e03-473f-88e2-e482d37613f1>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://advancedbuckle.com/5008-what-is-a-blog-a-blogger-and-why-you-should-start-blogging-now-15/,2024-02-20T22:24:30Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9629050493240356,706,2.4243314266204834,2
"Description: To the casual observer, the realm of Talinie seems a pastoral place full of hard-working, law-abiding citizens. But those who look beneath the surface -- as a regent must -- will see what lies beneath the beauty.
From the south, a power-hungry archduke has moved troops into two of Talinie's seven provinces, supposedly as a safeguard against goblin invasion. From the north, greedy guildmasters have encroached upon Talinie's lush forests and have ravaged large areas for the timber and ores they yield.
To keep yourself on the throne known as the Oak Seat, you must control these foreign interests without giving them reason to rise up against you, and at the same time beware of traitors within your own court -- it is whispered that the death of your predecessor was not really an accident.
This package includes:
- A full-color, eight page foldout cover containing detailed maps of the domain and other information every Talinien needs.
- Facts about the realm's history, geography, economy, and laws.
- Descriptions of the major NPCs in Talinie, friend and foe alike.
- Secrets and strategy tips to help the new regent manage the realm.
This Birthright domain sourcebook is designed for players who want to take the role of Thane of the realm, playing either a lawful priest or a paladin. Players of nonregent characters who live in or come from Talinie will also find this sourcebook useful.

"The Three Angels’ Messages are God’s special messages for last-day Christians. This message is to be shared with the world and will reach its climax with the second coming of Jesus. This threefold message appears in Revelation 14:6-16.
The first angel proclaims the everlasting gospel and calls for the restoration of the true worship of God as Creator, because the judgment hour has arrived.
Read more about the first angel’s message
“Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people—saying with a loud voice, ‘Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water’” (Revelation 14:6, 7).
The second angel warns against all humanly-originated forms of worship and beliefs that are not based completely on God’s Word.
Read more about the second angel’s message
“Another angel followed, saying, ‘Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication’” (Revelation 14:8).
Finally, the third angel proclaims God’s solemn warning against worshiping the beast and his image.
Read more about the third angel’s message
“Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, ‘If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation....they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.’ Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:9-12).
Note: though Scripture symbolically portrays these messages as being proclaimed by three angels, it is actually God’s people—His last-day church—who deliver them to the world. Additionally, two groups emerge—those who choose to follow God’s Word completely and those who choose to mix biblical teachings with human traditions.",<urn:uuid:cd32682d-4006-4b7e-a00e-5bd43e0337e8>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://adventweb.org/bibleinfo_questions/three-angels-messages,2024-02-20T21:46:48Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9622684717178345,513,1.941951036453247,2
"Since the start of the pandemic more than two years ago, more and more people are talking about behavioral health issues, including loneliness, social isolation and emotional changes. An increasing number of folks are starting to see mental health for what it is: one important component of your overall health and well-being, just like your physical health. However, having a conversation about mental health conditions, and reaching out for resources and supports can still feel complicated and out of reach.
Are there common warning signs for mental health conditions or crises? Are there specific factors that can lead to changes in mood or behaviors that may negatively affect someone’s well-being? What resources are out there – and how do I know if they are right for me?
The Mystic Valley Elder Services (MVES) Mental Health Outreach Program is here to help. This new grant-funded initiative is available to Spanish-speaking residents of Malden, Everett, Chelsea and Revere who are 60 years of age or older. Spanish-speaking older adults are often confronted with unique barriers to receiving assistance, but this new program is here to help. The Mental Health Outreach Program offers person-centered, strength-based mental health assistance from bilingual staff who will help support Spanish-speaking older adults to maintain independence and dignity.
MVES bilingual Mental Health Outreach Worker Ignacia Urquijo can assess, refer and provide timely assistance to older adults in need or distress, evaluate Spanish-speaking older adults’ needs for support in the community, help older adults seek and navigate behavioral health care services and treatment, work with health care partners to identify and refer older adults who might be at risk, and connect older adults to additional programs and services that might benefit them.
If you are concerned about your mental health, or someone you love, there are options available. You are not alone – speaking with someone can make a difference.
The new program is funded through a grant awarded to the Massachusetts Association of Councils on Aging by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Elder Affairs and support from Winchester Hospital – a member of Beth Israel Lahey Health.
Here are some questions to consider if you think you, or a friend/loved one, might benefit from speaking with our new Spanish-Speaking Mental Health Outreach Worker: Have things that used to feel easy started feeling difficult? Does the idea of doing daily tasks like making your bed now feel really, really hard? Have you lost interest in activities and hobbies you used to enjoy? Do you feel irritated – possibly to the point of lashing out at people you care about? Are you feeling increased sadness or worry lately? Have you been nervous or experiencing more stress these days? Do you feel lonelier these days? Have you lost interest in activities you used to enjoy?

"Editor’s Note: Deborah Morrissey-McGoff’s new paintings are included in a group show at The Miller Gallery in Hyde Park titled “Local Artists”. Aeqai is thus reprinting a feature that Editor Daniel Brown wrote for The Artist’s Magazine on Morrissey-McGoff’s paintings .
www.artistsmagazine.com – September 2010
Influenced by Italian Renaissance masters and naïve painters, Deborah Morrissey-McGoff paints imagined worlds in the most traditional of ways.
Deborah Morrissey-McGoff’s paintings are mesmerizing. As if we viewers were in a trance, a landscape will seem to open to a book-lined room, as if a hill were cut away. at times the pictures seem like rebus rhymes in which objects, shells or boats, for example, take the place of words. We could also say they read like pages of an illuminated manuscript—Les tres riches heures du Duc de Berry comes to mind, as does The Book of Kells—whose story is combined with the artist’s interpretations of fairy tales and creation stories. The pictures’ rich references to art and literary history make each one a kind of puzzle, showing the artist’s intimate knowledge and stylish inte- gration of influences from the past.
McGoff offers us sanctuaries, like this comfortable study within the hill, along the paths and streams emblematic of life’s journey. In Twilight Thoughts (oil, 48 x30) the robin, the shells, the nasturtium and the orchid are symbols of spiritual growth and transformation.
As painterly surfaces, they are, in her words, “jewellike,” an effect she achieves by painting countless thin layers of oil on birch panels prepared with traditional gesso, which contains marble dust and results in a surface less smooth than one resulting from acrylic gesso. McGoff distresses the surface even more. on top of the traditional gesso and between layers of oil paint, she rubs the surface in a circular motion with fine sandpaper. she next prepares what she calls a dirty glaze (Liquin, plus brown and purple mixed together) that she rubs into the surface, “lightly pulling out the glaze so it goes into the pockmarks left by the gesso.”
McGoff is primarily a landscape painter, but her new paintings combine elements from the still life genre. The paintings imply a journey through the landscapes; some contain
“My favorites were Italian Renaissance artists who painted on wood. I ended up married to a contractor; there’s wood everywhere! It was synchronicity.” ~ Deborah Morrisey-McGoff
A shrinelike sanctuary—a book-lined study, closed garden or medieval bed—often based upon italian renaissance paintings, as is the case with Dreaming Carpaccio (below). The sanctuaries become resting spots for the artist and viewer/traveler, as in a chinese landscape where the seeker goes up a mountain in order to retreat from urban or political strife in favor of a life of painting and study.
The artist herself calls these retreats “portals.” by providing a series of high-angle perspectives, she further implies that the city in the far distance is not necessarily the goal to be sought or attained. The languorous journeys implied by the oft-appearing river may lead instead to these inner shelters, as in A Bowl of Cherries (see an interpretation of A Bowl of Cherries). Newest are paintings with selected objects from daily life, juxtaposing the outdoor with the indoor, nature with nurture. a basket, a vase with or without flowers, birds, rabbits, seashells and fruits that have symbolic reso- nance function at the same time as composi- tional signposts, creating a path for the viewer’s eye, moving from foreground to middle ground to background.
Although she has a bachelor of fine arts degree in drawing, McGoff is self-taught as a painter. “I started out breaking all the rules as I fumbled around,” she explains. “My favorites were Italian renaissance artists who painted on wood. My husband is a contractor; there’s wood everywhere! it was synchronicity; the light bulb went off. I decided to emulate the italian painters I loved and work on wood.”
Cooking Up True Gesso
True gesso grounds should only be applied to rigid supports. McGoff paints on birch panels braced with redwood.
1. To one quart water, add 21⁄2 ounces hide glue (rabbitskin glue or canvas glue sizing). Let this mixture dissolve overnight.
2. In a double boiler, slowly heat the glue mixture to a moderate temperature. Do not boil.
3. With a wide brush apply this mixture to the sides of the panel you will paint on. Let it dry overnight.
4. Repeat the above formula. While the mixture is warm, slowly add 2 pounds whiting (powdered marble), continually stirring gently to avoid air bubbles.
5. Still stirring, add approximately 1⁄3 cup zinc or titanium powdered pigment. The final mixture should be the consis- tency of melted ice cream.
6. Using the palm of your hand, apply the first coat to the wood panel. With the heel of your hand, push the gesso into the grooves of the surface (the wood’s grain).
7. When the first coat is thoroughly dry, apply a second coat with a soft, wide brush. (I apply five coats in all. Each coat is applied in the opposite direction from the previous coat.) Apply coats gently to avoid brush marks.
8. Let the panel dry overnight.
9. To prepare the panel for paint, first sand the surface with fine sandpaper. If there are any drips on the sides of the panel, sand those down. You may also do a “wet” sand by dipping your hand in water and rubbing the surface in a circular motion, which will dissolve the gesso enough so you can move it around and make the surface smoother. Let the panel dry completely.
10. Brush a mixture of one part white shellac and two parts denatured alcohol generously on the panel to seal the surface. Wipe off the excess with a soft cloth. (Note: White (clear) shellac has a shelf life of approximately one year. To test its viability, put a small amount on your fingertip and rub. It should feel smooth, not grainy.
From daily life, juxtaposing the outdoor with the indoor, nature with nurture. a basket, a vase with or without flowers, birds, rabbits, seashells and fruits that have symbolic resonance function at the same time as compositional signposts, creating a path for the viewer’s eye, moving from foreground to middle ground to background.
An Interpretation of A Bowl of Cherries
McGoff invites us to create narratives for which she leaves plenty of clues. The sanctuary or shelter that appears in A Bowl of Cherries (at left; oil, 48×36) allows the artist another homage to art history, with the landscape/window in the rear of the room, a common trope in European portraiture. These paintings within paintings, with their multiple perspectives that are often tiered, as in Surrealism, are a tour de force and yet have the immediacy of rebus rhymes.
We could almost expect Botticelli’s Venus to appear out of the water in this idyll, to walk up the stairs into this secret room—a painter’s studio is implied, as is the idea of a hideaway surrounded by art’s beauty, an utopia within an Eden. Layering her ideas thus, the artist combines aesthetics and religious metaphysics, and then inserts a still life, the welcoming bowl of cherries. The shift in perspective from the stairs to the black-and-white marbled floor is a classic McGoff motif, keeping the perspectives slightly off balance.
The ogee arch of the mirrorlike room is superimposed upon a square of grass, surrounded by a brick wall, within which might be a cultivated garden. The closed garden is both a visual and a literary symbol. She is tending her garden as did Henry David Thoreau, as well as the Chinese painter-poets of the T’ang, Song and Yuan dynasties. In A Bowl of Cherries, the artist looks outward to the far distance (the unattainable?), suggesting that we linger awhile in either the sanctuary or in the garden.
Most painters today use acrylic gesso, but McGoff prefers the original recipe. “The gesso coating is like a plaster wall with pockmarks caused by air bubbles,” she says. “Making and applying the gesso is an all-day process with a lot of variables. it’s necessary to heat the gesso to a moderate temperature and apply it indoors in a controlled, temperate environment. You get better at the process by just doing it. It’s like golf. You just have to do it over and over again!” (see cooking Up True Gesso).
Then McGoff seals the plaster with a mixture of shellac and denatured alcohol. “If I didn’t seal the gesso, it would dissolve if it came into contact with water,” she explains. The final stage of her preparation is to apply an undercoat of ochre and cadmium red mixed together; she calls this warm underpainting her base color.
Playing with scale
The architectural elements frequently depicted within her paintings usually pay homage to the masters of the Venetian high renaissance, but because of her clever uses of fantastical spaces and high-angle perspectives, the paintings exude more of the freshness and vigor of early florentine renaissance painters, such as Giotto and Duccio. The blocky depiction reminiscent of Giotto’s forms gives McGoff her tendency toward totemic shifts in scale. Thus, an orchid will be tall, and a boat, miniscule; an arch will be all-encompassing or tiny.
Transitional periods in art, for instance, the romanesque/Gothic to the renaissance, are where her paintings fit, yet her contemporary spin is enhanced by her interest in primitive/naïve art, folk and outsider traditions. “Naïve painters often take the most important element and make it the largest thing in the painting,” she says. The hugely scaled tree in Dreaming Carpaccio, for example, and the mysterious islandlike landform (with a lone tree at the top and a path leading upward, but perhaps nowhere) in A Bowl of Cherries (above) integrate these motifs, while making them peculiarly accessible to the viewer, as they are architectonic and childlike concurrently.
Alluding to Eden
The deep, pristine colors—whatever palette she chooses, she always “ratchets the color up a notch”—and her meticulously rendered forms evoke the Garden of eden’s Tree of Knowledge, which links her again to the italian masters, but also to the european and american tradition of the sublime. These edenic landscapes are refreshed by an interest in integrating floral arrangements or individual flowers into the foreground spaces (see Spring Memory, above). some of these flowers are in vases; sometimes they’re still growing in a garden. oddly, the genre those paintings of over- scaled or radically foreshortened flowers most resemble is portraiture, (see Equipoise). The dialectic between portraiture and still life raises the flowers above both genres and enhances the elements of fantasy and playfulness manifest in all her work.
Blockx white and Naples yellow; winsor & newton jaune brilliant; Grumbacher unbleached titanium; rembrandt cadmium yellow light, nickel titanium yellow, cadmium orange, cadmium red, ultramarine light, phthalo blue red, cerulean blue, alizarin crimson and Van Dyke brown; sennelier phthalo green, sap green cool, yellow ochre, raw sienna and raw umber
Differing orders of Perspective
McGoff implies distance through spatial manipulation and radical reductions or enlargements in scale, often giving her paintings the feel and look of infinite space, coupled with the charm of the miniature. Persian and Mughul miniatures have the same fantastical look and could be another tradition she has assimilated. McGoff’s garden and sanctuary motifs do ask us to linger for awhile, with the same sophisticated sense of earthly delight of the Persian miniature or rug. She asks us to fly with her on a magical journey through space into beauty. If “magical realism” can apply to paintings as well as to fiction, McGoff would be its premier practitioner.
Meet Deborah Morrissey-McGoff
The elements that inhabit McGoff’s paintings are objects she loves, cultivates, grows and collects. In addition to the painters of the Italian Renaissance, Caspar David Friedrich has been a major influence, as has J.M.W. Turner, whose work surprised her, she says, by its joy. McGoff has had solo shows at the Springfield Museum of Art, the Southern Ohio Museum, the Weston Gallery in Cincinnati and the Robert Kidd Gallery in Birmingham, Michigan. The Arts Midwest/ National Endowment for the Arts and the Ohio Arts Council have awarded her fellowships.

"Astro Compass, Mk II, and Case, Boes
A WW2 vintage aircraft Astro Compass, Mk II, in its original bakelite case, used for celestial navigation. Used across many versions of US Army Air Force aircraft with navigator crew during the era, such as bombers B-17 Flying Fortress, B-24 Liberator, and B-29 Superfortress, and transports C-46 Commando, C-47 Dakota, and C-54 Skymaster. The compass would be placed in a fixed mount on top of the instrument panel or in the navigators compartment, and sighted to a known star, e.g. North Star. The bearing of the aircraft can then be determined by using/aligning the indexing scales on the components of the Astro Compass.
Here is a helpful video on the Astro Compass from a fellow enthusiast.",<urn:uuid:d7b5b6bc-13d2-4a23-8ea9-a72f71140f2c>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://aeroantique.com/products/astro-compass-mk-ii-case-and-instructions-boes,2024-02-20T22:18:17Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9083783030509949,174,2.2911529541015625,2
"Aeroexpress to Entertain Young Passengers aboard Trains
Jun 28, 2019
In the midst of the summer holidays, Aeroexpress offers an exciting entertainment programme to young passengers while travelling by train.
Animators and coordinators will be holding some onboard train fun activities for children during trips on all Aeroexpress routes until the end of summer.
The theme of this entertainment programme is travelling. Young passengers will solve interesting quizzes and riddles, do some crafts and listen to educational stories, and will be given souvenirs from the company
Parents will have a chance to spend some great time with their children or leave them with the activity organizers and have some rest.
The programme will be carried out every Thursday to Sunday from 15:00 to 20:30. Coordinators will meet children and their parents near the carriage where the programme will take place. At the Belorussky Rail Terminal it is going to be the second carriage from the train’s head and at Sheremetyevo, Vnukovo and Domodedovo Airports it is the second carriage from the train’s tail. For trains departing from the Paveletsky and Kievsky Rail Terminals, it is the tail carriage.
Children aged five and under travel free by Aeroexpress trains. Young travellers aged five to seven can take advantage of the kid’s fare, with one ticket costing 130 roubles. A child’s ticket is issued at the place of departure on the date of travel in the presence of a child. Moreover, passengers travelling with children can use a free Personal Assistant service, which implies that company employees will meet them at the airport, provide assistance with purchasing tickets ahead of the queue and handling their baggage in train carriages.",<urn:uuid:cda5d1e2-0f4d-4e42-b317-bee906141278>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://aeroexpress.ru/en/aero/press/news20101508.html,2024-02-20T21:33:57Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9418853521347046,356,1.472580909729004,1
"The Internet has made it possible for state lotteries to expand their sales online. While only a few states currently allow players to purchase lottery tickets online, many more are expected to follow suit. These websites offer convenient purchasing and claiming processes as well as a variety of games and promotions. Online players can also participate in popular national draws like Mega Millions.
However, creating an online lottery platform is a complicated process. As an owner, you’ll need to constantly maintain the website, fix bugs and implement new technologies. As a result, you’ll have very little time to focus on marketing and revenue-generation. Plus, if you’re not experienced in programming or have limited technical skills, you’ll likely need the help of a software provider.
Legitimate lottery sites will provide access to all lotteries available in your state, as well as lottery games nationwide. They will also allow you to compare current jackpots and odds from different lottery games. While larger jackpots are more common, lower jackpot prizes can be lucrative. If you’re just looking for the thrill of playing the lottery, you may want to choose a smaller lottery game. These often have better odds, but the prize payouts are still substantial.
Many online lottery sites have a subscription option that allows you to purchase tickets for every drawing. Subscriptions vary in price depending on the number of drawings you’d like to buy. However, it’s important to note that most state-sponsored lottery websites charge the same price online as they do offline, so you won’t be paying a premium for convenience. So, it’s best to shop around and find an online lottery site that fits your needs.
The Powerball lottery is available in 45 states, with draws on Wednesdays and Mondays at 10:59pm ET. The ticket sales for these draws close up to two hours before the draw. Ticket purchases are available for as little as $0.05 per ticket. If you win, you can claim your prize online or at the lottery office. There’s also an online pool feature that lets you create a group and pool money to buy tickets in bulk.
The online lottery is still a relatively new phenomenon. While federal law permits lottery sales online, many states are still reluctant to allow the practice. Many states have concerns about fraud, as well as the potential for selling lottery tickets to minors. They also worry about losing the tax revenue from lottery ticket purchases. If you’re considering an online lottery, you should look into the state’s laws before making a purchase.
Online lottery sites are legal in the US and have been available since 2011. There are several advantages to playing online. In addition to accessibility, many online lottery sites feature tips and promotions to increase your chances of winning.",<urn:uuid:1c243f2a-4e51-4085-a5ad-bd3e4be352f4>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://aerogrowmanufacturing.com/creating-an-online-lottery-platform/,2024-02-20T22:29:05Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9633443355560303,579,1.1349964141845703,1
"Sales people are enthusiastic – rightfully so – and therefore would take Bid / No Bid decisions with the heart. Decisions with the heart are normally good for motivation. And this is essential to fight hard on a tender with lots of strong competitors. But should we really follow (only) the heart? And are all the hearts of the team beating in tune?
Certainly not! Bidding is an expensive activity. Companies have to control the costs of this “overhead” activity to remain competitive. Consequently, resources are limited and choices have to be made. A bit of objectivity in making the choices is more than welcome.
Typically, companies organize a Bid / No Bid meeting before starting to work. In the following post, we had explained how Contract Risk Scoring can help you:
To Bid or Not to Bid – That is the question
Given the current market conditions, it is tempting for businesses to submit a proposal for every opportunity that they become aware of.
Such a simplistic approach is often not the best use of finite resources or one that will lead to securing the package of work.
The following are some key considerations when deciding whether to bid or not to bid:
- Why do we want to do this package of work?
- Is it a strategically important opportunity for us in terms of customer or market?
- Does the work have a future? Is it commercially viable? Is it funded?
- Do we have the best people available to successfully deliver the work?
- Is it a commercially attractive package of work for us?
- Are the customer’s expectations of cost and schedule achievable?
- If a competitive bid, how many competitors are there?
- What will the proposal cost to prepare?
- What happens if we do NOT bid?
- Have we undertaken proper risk assessments for the work and for our business should we secure the work?
These considerations are a useful starting point for the type of questions / analysis which needs to be undertaken before a decision to bid or not to bid is taken.

"I’ve been having a fantastic time living ten minutes from the beach, learning little bits of Zulu, eating as much cheap and delicious fruit as I can get my hands on, and – of course – doing lots science.
I’ve been working with Prof Thumbi Ndung’u at the KwaZulu-Natal Research Institute for TB & HIV (K-RITH) since the end of September. My part of the lab is interested in understanding how HIV affects anti-TB immunity in the lungs. My contribution to this story is going to be using a novel assay my lab in Cambridge helped to develop in order to look at the transcriptional profiles of antimicrobial genes involved in the innate immune response to TB. Because it’s science, progress comes in fits and spurts, and everything takes longer than you think it will. Naturally, I’m still optimizing and haven’t gotten to the real meat of the question just yet. For those of you with knowledge of flow cytometry, I’m working with alveolar macrophages, which are very autofluorescent due to their size and granularity. This complicates everything else in the panel, including the RNA FISH aspect as the target sequences are also conjugated to fluorophores. Hopefully I can have some real data and possibly a figure or two by the end of my time here to share with you all.
Another exciting part of my position here is that I get to spend two mornings a week at one of the large public hospitals in Durban collecting patient samples. We work with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which you obtain by sticking a bronchoscope down into the lobes of the lung, flushing them with half a pint of saline, and then sucking back as much liquid/cells you can. We collect samples from patients with a variety clinical indications, ranging from TB (with or without co-morbid HIV), lung and blood cancers, to sarcoidosis, lupus, and interstitial lung disease. The pulmonologists have been very welcoming and eager to teach me, and I get to assist the nurses in distributing the fluid for various clinical and research needs.
Most of all it’s been a real pleasure to get to talk with folks before and after the procedure and make connections between their medical history/clinical presentation and what I observe from their cells. For example, seeing a black pellet of cells (for the non-scientists, your cells should be white) in a tube from a person who has smoked for 30 years is just another reminder not to smoke!
Since TB is so common in SA, especially in this province, we treat all samples as potentially infectious. Accordingly, all of our work is done in a BSL3 facility to prevent the inhalation of TB-containing aerosols. This has been another transition for me coming from a HIV background where a full suit and respirator isn’t necessary, though it’s surprisingly enjoyable!
I’ve also dipped my toes into a bit of a side project, which has — unknowingly — been made possible by Professor Taylor. Another part of the lab works on mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, which participate in the innate response to bacterial infections, and express a MHC class I – related (though non-polymorphic) protein. The ligands for this receptor are still being elucidated, though there have not yet been any endogenous ligands identified. However, with the skills I learned in Professor Taylor’s Biomedicinal Chemistry course, I’ve been able to do some preliminary molecular docking studies that are giving a pretty good indication that my PI may have found the first endogenous ligand! So cheers to Professor Taylor and Wesleyan for those skills!
Thank you again for each of your contributions to make this possible for me. In particular, thank you to MB&B and African studies for the financial support, and to Professor Oliver for sticking with me when my plans were in jeopardy.",<urn:uuid:2c8fe154-6d8b-4f6d-a2e5-c202fe632c7f>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://africa.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2015/10/26/update-from-holly-everett-in-durban-south-africa/,2024-02-20T22:15:01Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.957695722579956,838,1.3326842784881592,1
"The Ebola virus outbreak of 2014 in West Africa caused more than 11,000 deaths. At the time, scientists were working on several experimental vaccines and treatments but none were licensed for use in humans.
Antibodies, which are special defence proteins made by our body in response to infection or vaccination, are one of the treatments that were investigated. Once the best antibodies for fighting a disease have been identified, they can be made in bulk and used as a treatment.
Our latest research, published in Cell Reports, shows that antibodies isolated from volunteers who had been given an experimental Ebola vaccine were effective at defeating the virus in six guinea pigs.
In all, 82 antibodies were derived from the blood cells of eleven people given the vaccine. These were combined into three separate groups, with each group containing three or four antibodies with different properties. One combination of antibodies successfully cured all six animals infected with the Ebola virus when it was administered three days after the start of the infection.
Perfect combination of antibodies
Vaccines can have side effects, so for people with immune system disorders, older people and pregnant women, antibodies are a safer form of treatment. Antibodies can be isolated from human blood by selecting individual B cells – the specialised immune cells that secrete antibodies. The genetic code for making an antibody is inside the B cells, which is extracted using advanced molecular techniques. Once this code is known, huge quantities of the antibody can be made in a lab.
Antibodies attach to viruses and prevent them from entering cells. Each antibody has different properties, such as how and where it binds to the virus and if it can block the virus from infecting the cells. These properties were examined for the 82 antibodies.
The antibodies isolated in this study from vaccinated donors had the same characteristics as antibodies isolated from immunised animals and people who have survived Ebola. Those Ebola antibodies are already well-studied and available for clinical trials in humans.
There is an advantage for developing antibody treatments from healthy people who have been vaccinated – it resolves the difficult issue of handling unscreened blood samples from human survivors in remote areas, where donors may potentially harbour Ebola or other infectious viruses such as hepatitis B or HIV.
Even if the particular combination of antibodies fails to treat these viruses, all is not lost. Antibodies from this study, combined with antibodies from other research groups which react to all species may provide a better treatment. Antibodies are also useful tools for studying the Ebola virus and human immune responses towards it. By tracking how antibodies attack cells, it’s possible to identify the vulnerable parts of the virus.
This study shows that a human vaccine trial is a golden opportunity to isolate antibodies that can effectively be used as a treatment. This may be important for tackling emerging infections like bird flu, MERS, SARS and Chikungunya viruses, for which we have no established drugs or therapeutic antibodies.

"Next year, Facebook will launch an incubator program in partnership with Lagos-based Co-Creation Hub (CCHub) to help develop tech startups and train 50,000 Nigerians in digital skills.
Facebook’s announcement comes after Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, said during his visit to Lagos in July that the company would open its first Google Launchpad space outside the United States in Lagos. True to its word, a Google Launchpad Start event – a one week boot camp for early stage startups – was held last month in Lagos hosting twenty-one tech companies.
In 2016, Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg visited technology companies in Lagos and pledged to invest $24 million through his Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in Andela, a Lagos-based startup that trains software developers.
This influx of global technology giants into the Nigerian tech ecosystem does not come as a surprise. According to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), there are now ninety-one million internet users in Nigeria. Nigeria is also Facebook’s largest market in Africa with twenty-two million people in the country using the social media website every month, and ten million logging in daily to the platform on mobile devices.
Major obstacles to technology penetration in Africa include poverty and poor telecommunications infrastructure. This means that a large number of people cannot afford high-end mobile phones and computers that support popular applications; in addition to slow internet speeds which result in fewer people surfing the Web for longer periods of time. Facebook tried to tackle this problem by introducing Facebook Lite, a version of Facebook built specifically to work smoothly with poor data connections and low-end phones in 2015. It was designed for developing countries like Nigeria and seven other emerging countries. Facebook Lite might be responsible for the surge in Facebook’s popularity in Nigeria.
Other tech companies like the Ghanaian-based Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) and Venture Capital for Africa (VC4Africa) have also plugged into the Nigerian tech startup market. MEST opened its first incubator in Lagos last month and has invested more than $20 million in African entrepreneurs, while VC4Africa, a platform that connects entrepreneurs to funding and resources has emphasised African developed technology, from Nairobi to Lagos. VC4Africa’s business development lead, Bertil van Vugt said, “we’re now really starting to see the quality [of Nigerian start-ups] …I spent some time in Nairobi a couple of years back when it was really the start-up capital of Africa but we’ve seen this start-up capital focus shift to Lagos.”
According to Quartz, Nigeria attracted more startup funding than anywhere else in Africa in 2016, beating South Africa and Kenya, two other leading tech startup markets in Africa.
This also comes at a time when the Nigerian tech ecosystem is looking beyond Lagos, which has been the country’s center of technological innovation for the past few decades. Mark Essien, the founder of hotels.ng – a leading travel and hotel booking site – who had to move to Lagos for his company to receive seed funding, is one of the individuals spearheading this movement. According to him, “it is very important… [that] somebody can stay in Aba and say that ‘I want to build a technology company’ and have all the resources necessary to be successful at their disposal without having to leave for Lagos.”
Another start-up founder, Korede Moshood, founder of Comestibles, which offers food delivery services in Ibadan said “The Lagos market is really getting choked day by day and as a new start-up, you could get fried if you initially expose yourself to the highly competitive market in which Lagos start-ups operate.”",<urn:uuid:23c4dd98-396e-4e50-826f-79794d8435d3>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://africasecuritynewswire.com/technology/2017/12/18/facebook-and-google-invest-in-the-nigerian-technology-ecosystem,2024-02-20T21:21:04Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9587741494178772,794,1.8678796291351318,2

"Employees from the casino marched to Mayor Don Guardian’s workplace on the morning of November 3, 2014, to ask him to rethink granting concessions, which the casino mentioned had been needed to stay open.

"- To that point, our generation popularized greed on Wall Street. Remember the S&L debacle and the Merger and Acquisition Craze in the 80’s, with all the insider trading? That was mostly us when we were in our 30’s and 40’s, with a little help from the the Great Generation.
- Not to beat a dead horse, but think about the financial crisis in 2008, certainly greed at its most extreme. That was probably a cross-generational event — some Millennials were old enough to work as bond and mortgage brokers, but Boomers were in the position of authority at the time and so have to bear much of the responsibility.
- Which generation is behind the split between the left and right that began in the late 1990’s and still runs through today, dividing our country to the point of embarrassment? That would be us in our 50’s and 60’s — the younger generations are not the driving force here.
- We started two wars that are still going on today at a cost of trillions of dollars, and it will be the Millennials who will have to bail out the country. And speaking of bail-outs, let’s add the fact that we Boomers plan to live forever. The younger generation will have to pay more taxes to cover their own retirement and maintain social security because of the longevity of Boomers.
As we said at the beginning of this rant, there’s always a tendency for every generation to think the upcoming one is a disaster. The Great Generation had their negative opinions of Boomers when they were young, as their parents had about them almost 100 years ago. But such perceptions are inaccurate and wrong-headed, as the world tends to progress from one generation to the next.
And that’s certainly the case with Millenials, who are regarded by some as heaped with potential. As researchers Howe and Strauss argue, “they are … on track to become a powerhouse generation, full of technology planners, community shapers, institution builders, and world leaders. Indeed, Millennials have a solid chance to become America’s next great generation.”
Of course, it’s too early to tell whether or not Millennials will end up as one of the great ones, but if they do, well, that’s something Boomers can take credit for — we raised them.",<urn:uuid:05b83de9-8211-4f13-8a0d-cb1a9d53c3a8>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://agnituslife.com/defending-millennials-part-2/5/,2024-02-20T22:38:37Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9744551777839661,495,1.9564310312271118,2

"Angling in Greenland
Do rods, spinners and fish in all shapes and sizes have you hooked? Fishing is a pastime that can be enjoyed at any time of the year by people who love the challenge of rivers and lakes.

Trout fishing in Greenland
Greenland's trout fishing is for you who want a wilderness experience in a secluded mountain valley with pristine rivers. Throughout the summer, you have the opportunity to get a bold and beautiful mountain trout on the hook. In June, the fish from rivers and lakes gradually migrate to the fjords to eat their fill before returning during August. At the coasts you need spinners and tins, in the rivers spinners and flies.
Trout fishing in West Greenland
If you visit Sisimiut, Maniitsoq or Kangerlussuaq, you have ample opportunity for angling in pristine rivers, where there are often no more than 6 to 12 fishermen at a time. The fishing destinations are wilderness experiences that can be reached by helicopter or boat.
Fishing in South Greenland
If you visit South Greenland, you are guaranteed a lot of mountain trout. With rivers rich in mountain trout, South Greenland has become known as Greenland's pantry. At Eriksfjord you will find from mid-July to September the optimal conditions for fly fishing and spin fishing.
Angling for trout
In general, one can say that the trout are right where there is most food. Where the water is deep enough to cover the dorsal fins and where the water is relatively stagnant. Between islands, at river basins and estuaries in small coves and bays, the trout are sheltered from the current and almost waiting to be teased by you.
Fly fishing for mountain trout in Greenland
Do you want to try your hand at fly fishing? Then there is plenty of opportunity for that in Greenland! The rivers in Greenland are most often pristine and have crystal clear water that makes sight fishing possible. As with angling, fly fishing is a short but exciting season that stretches over the summer months in Greenland. A fly fishing trip can extend over several days, but can also just be a day trip if you wish.
What is sight fishing?
Sight fishing is simply fishing for visible fish. There is a very special excitement about sight fishing, as you almost have to sneak into the fish with your fly. What makes sight fishing both challenging and exciting is the fact that you can see the fish, but it can also see you, so you have to be a calm and skilled angler to practice sight fishing.

In deep water in Greenland
The seas are teeming with fish. Go onboard a boat, head out to sea where the water reaches depths of 100-300 metres, and experience the indescribable feeling as flounder, Greenland halibut, redfish and Atlantic wolf-fish are pulled in over the railings. The redfish in Greenlandic waters is a real whopper. It can be up to 1 metre in length and weigh up to 15 kg. They’re often found in shoals, so once you’ve caught one, there’ll usually be others out there.
Ice fishing in Greenland
When the temperature moves below freezing and the water crystallizes into a thick layer of ice, Greenland's fjords become an ice adventure ideal for ice fishing. Ice fishing is a very special experience when you - or the Greenlandic fisherman - pull halibut up from the deep sea under the ice. Go fishing with a local out and try fishing with thick ice. Ice fishing in Greenland is possible from January to April, it is important that you have the right equipment and warm clothes, as it can quickly become a cold pleasure in the Greenlandic winter months.
The tradition behind ice fishing
Ice fishing is one of the oldest traditions in Greenland and has since the dawn of time been an essential part of the Greenlanders' lifestyle. Going ice fishing in Greenland is a unique opportunity for you who want to experience traditional Greenlandic culture and at the same time catch a fish or ten. North Greenland in particular is optimal for ice fishing. Along the west coast from Qaanaaq to Uummannaq, Ilulissat, Sisimiut, Kangerlussuaq and all the way to Nuuk, and in East Greenland you have from January to April the opportunity to try your hand at ice fishing. Each destination tackles ice fishing in its own way, and there is therefore a sea of unique experiences waiting for you.
DID YOU KNOW?
Fishing rules in Greenland
To fish in Greenland, you must have a fishing license. A fishing license is most easily obtained at post offices, where you simply fill in a sheet that then serves as your fishing license. The price is:
- DKK 75 for a 24-hour fishing license
- DKK 200 for a 7-day fishing license
- DKK 500 for a month's fishing license.

From her futuristic base in California to the blue waters of the Solomon Island and to Tokyo itself, the ZRS battles the Japanese juggernaut. From the fall of Singapore to the Battle of the Coral Sea, her crew know tragedy and triumph as they take their mighty but fragile airship into combat.

"So, you’re thinking of putting together a corporate video or a commercial? First you need a script. And for a commercial or marketing video, you’ll want to use an A/V script format. A/V stands for Audio/Visual. It’s a format that breaks down your script into two columns- what you hear (audio) and what you see (visual).
Imagine an A/V script like a playbook. It gives you a scene-by-scene breakdown of the visuals and sounds. It’s super helpful when you’re planning your project because it lets you figure out all your shots, audio, and visuals in advance. And guess what? It saves you loads of time and cash when you’re filming and editing.
Now, don’t confuse this with a Hollywood-style format. The A/V script stands out because it uses a simple two-column format. And the best part? While screenplays often need fancy software, you can whip up an A/V script in any old word processing program. Pretty neat, huh?
- An AV script separates a script into audio and visual components, making it easier to plan your shoot and communicate your vision to your team.
- The AV script is a more straightforward and efficient way to communicate your vision to your team, saving you time and money during filming and editing.
- The AV script is a great tool to use in your pre-production planning, allowing you to break down the script into specific shots and audio, making it easier to communicate your vision to the director, cinematographer, and sound designer.
What Exactly is an A/V Script Format?
An A/V script is an essential part of pre-production planning for video content. It provides a comprehensive breakdown of the visuals and sounds required for each scene. By separating the audio and visual elements, it ensures that everyone involved in the production has a clear understanding of what is required.
Those in the know will tell you an A/V script is not the same as a “shooting script.” A shooting script is a more detailed version of the script used during production. It includes camera angles, lighting, and other technical details. An A/V script is a precursor to the shooting script and is used during pre-production planning.
Creating an A/V script is a crucial step in getting your video content greenlit. It helps you to visualize your ideas and communicate them effectively to others. By breaking down each scene into its audio and visual components, you can identify any potential issues before production begins. One weakness you’ll find among those who aren’t trained scriptwriters is they’ll tend to write for the audio (what we hear) but not visual (what we see. That’s what a lot of copywriters do. Forgive them. They don’t know better.
But you do, right. At least you will after reading this. And before you’re done, you’ll have some links to some templates and even some software you can use for your next project.
Why is an A/V Script better than a Hollywood style format?
When it comes to writing scripts, there are two main formats to choose from: Hollywood style and A/V script. While Hollywood style scripts are great for movies or TV shows, A/V scripts are a better choice for commercials or other short-form video content.
Movies usually have huge staffs with several who manage and work with the script. Every actor and essential crew will have a copy. And they’ll do a “script breakdown” which turns what starts out as a manuscript into a very involved process. Unlike a Hollywood style script, which can be dozens or hundreds of pages long, an A/V script is typically only a few pages. This makes it much easier and faster to write, and also makes it easier for the video crew to shoot.
The two column format serves to inform everyone on the crew what need to be shot and recorded. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of an A/V script is its efficiency.
A/V scripts are typically split into two columns, with the audio on one side and the video on the other. This makes it easy to see at a glance what needs to be shot and what needs to be said. It also makes it easy to make changes or revisions, since everything is laid out in a clear and organized way.
The Script is the “Blueprint”
An A/V script also serves as a blueprint for the video crew. Since everything is laid out in a clear and organized way, it’s easy for the crew to see exactly what shots they need to get and what needs to be said on camera. In effect, the script breakdown was done by the writer. This can save a lot of time and money, since the crew won’t need to spend as much time figuring out what they need to shoot.
An A/V script is also better suited to the needs of the audience. Since commercials are typically short, the audience doesn’t have a lot of time to absorb a lot of information. An A/V script is designed to be concise and to the point, which makes it easier for the audience to understand and remember the message.
Structure of an A/V Script
When it comes to creating an A/V script, structure is key. A well-structured script can help ensure that your message is conveyed effectively and efficiently. Here’s a breakdown of the key components of an A/V script:
The two-column script is a standard format for A/V scripts. You’ll see variations on which side goes where, but the audio, dialogue, and narration go on one side, and the video and visual descriptions on the other. Which side is best? You’ll find writers and agencies differ. Regardless, this simple format ensure that the audio and visual elements of your script stay synchronized and work together seamlessly.
Dialogue is an essential component of an A/V script. It’s important to keep your dialogue concise and to the point. Avoid using overly complex language or jargon that your audience may not understand. Your dialogue should be natural and conversational, and should flow smoothly from one line to the next.
The shot list is a critical component of your A/V script. It’s a detailed breakdown of all the shots you’ll need to capture to bring your script to life. Your shot list should include information about the camera angles, framing, and movement for each shot. This will help ensure that your videographer knows exactly what shots they need to capture, and how to capture them.
In summary, the structure of an A/V script is critical to its success. By developing a clear concept, writing in a two-column format, keeping your dialogue concise, and creating a detailed shot list, you can create an A/V script that effectively conveys your message to your target audience.
Crafting an A/V Script
Crafting an A/V script is an essential part of producing a video project. Whether you are a screenwriter, director, or assistant director, creating a well-crafted A/V script is crucial to bringing the written words to life. Here are some tips for crafting an A/V script:
A/V Script Template
Using an A/V script template is a helpful way to organize your script into two streams: visual and audio cues. A two-column A/V script template allows you to pair visual and audio cues together, making it easier to blueprint a shooting script. The director and assistant directors can co-create and visualize how to best bring the scriptwriters’ written words to life alongside the scriptwriter.
Here are some examples of A/V scripts:
- StudioBinder provides an Ultimate AV Script Template to help you write better ads. They also provide a detailed guide on how to write a commercial script using their template.
- Pixel Valley Studio provides an example of an A/V two-column script used for the demo video they created for Hostfully.com.
- SlideShare provides an AV script sample for a product marketing animation.
These examples show how A/V scripts can be used to plan and organize the content of different types of videos, including commercials, corporate videos, and documentaries. I hope these examples help you understand what an A/V script looks like!
Crafting a “commercial” can be challenging, and it’s mostly done by ad agencies. If this is something you’d like to work on, it’s essential to know where you’re going. When writing a commercial script, it’s important to be clear on what you must deliver. That’s why it’s wise to use professional standards when writing “spec” scripts or showing an agency your portfolio. Those that know the right tools to use are viewed as “insiders.” It’s not just who you know, but what you know that makes the difference. Being sloppy in your choices can detour your vision if you’re not careful.
Thankfully, it’s simple to learn how to write a commercial script. Using an A/V script template can help you organize your thoughts and ensure that your commercial script is well-crafted. The template will allow you to include visual and audio cues, dialogue, voiceovers, and even music cues. I’m not going to go into the conceptualizing in this article. This is just about the formatting.
Crafting an A/V script can be a daunting task, but using an A/V script template, once you get accustomed to using it will feel very natural. And you’ll be able to write freely to create a properly formatted, well-crafted A/V script that will bring your video project to life. Am I overselling the A/V script? Not at all!
Creating the Final Product
Once you have written your A/V script, it’s time to move from pre-production into “production.” This is the “lights, camera, ACTION! phase that is so exciting. Your script which served as a blueprint WILL be deviated from as the “creatives” add their ideas to make the whole greater than the sum of its parts.
Don’t begrudge that. You did your job as a writer. You can feel proud you gave them a good product.
You did, didn’t you. If you’d like to learn more about what goes into writing a good AV script, look around. There are resources being planned for you right here on this website.
You can use software such as Celtx, a professional screenwriting software that includes tools for, not just writing your script, but creating storyboards, shot lists, and more. With Celtx, you can easily create a visual representation of your script, which can help you to better understand how your final product will look and feel.
Once you have your montage and workflow in place, it’s time to start scheduling your shoot. This involves creating a detailed timeline for your project, including everything from casting to filming to post-production editing. It’s important to be realistic when creating your schedule, as this will help to ensure that your final product is completed on time and within budget.
To create a schedule, you can use a variety of tools, including spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel. With Excel, you can create a detailed timeline that includes dates, times, and deadlines for each step of the process. This can help you to stay organized and on track throughout the entire project.
Finally, it’s important to seek feedback on your final product. This can help you to identify areas where you can improve, as well as to gain valuable insights into the overall quality of your work. Feedback can come from a variety of sources, including colleagues, friends, and family members.
When seeking feedback, it’s important to be open and receptive to criticism. This can be difficult, as it can be hard to hear negative feedback about your work. However, it’s important to remember that feedback is an essential part of the creative process, and that it can help you to grow and improve as a filmmaker.
In conclusion, creating a final product from your A/V script involves several key steps, including creating a montage and workflow, scheduling your shoot, and seeking feedback. By following these steps and using the right tools and techniques, you can create a final product that is both professional and engaging.

Additionally, mobile slot gaming often comes with exclusive bonuses and promotions. Mobile players may receive special offers and rewards that are not available to desktop players. These bonuses can significantly enhance the gaming experience and provide players with even more opportunities to win.
The Future of Mobile Slot Gaming
The popularity of mobile slot gaming shows no signs of slowing down. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more exciting developments in the world of mobile casinos. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, for example, could revolutionize the way we play slot games.

"Among the saddest movie scenes are those where parents and children get separated. Remember “Sophie’s Choice” or “Not Without My Daughter”?
So I was particularly interested in this story in the San Diego Union Tribune today. It seems that this Mexican couple paid some people in Tijuana to sneak them into the United States.
The deal was that they would get everyone across for $8,200, that’s $2,500 per adult and $1,600 per child.
According to immigration they convinced the parents to let them smuggle the children across using fake birth certificates. The kids were ages 2 and 3. The parents would then cross on foot through the hills.
But the parents got caught by Border Patrol and were simply sent back home.
So, what to do about the kids? They were told by the smugglers that they could buy them back for $7,000 or they would sell the kids to someone else.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the rescue. Posing as relatives, they showed up at a motel. ICE proceeded to arrest two women for their role in human smuggling.
The family is reunited, thanks to Uncle Sam. And with any luck ICE will be able to unravel this ring and put a bunch of people in jail.
As for Mexico’s help in the illegal alien crisis, the Mexican military is pointing rifles at Border Patrol agents again.

"We show you our most important and recent visitors news details Ten dead as Mexico church roof collapses in the following article
Hind Al Soulia - Riyadh - MEXICO CITY — At least 10 people, including three children, were killed when the roof of a church collapsed in northern Mexico.
The collapse happened on Sunday afternoon local time as around 100 people were attending a baptism at Santa Cruz church in Ciudad Madero.
Sixty people were injured, at least two of them seriously, and dozens were trapped underneath the rubble.
Local residents rushed to the building with shovels and pickaxes to try to free those trapped.
Search and rescue teams have since arrived at the scene and two cranes are on site to remove the debris.
The governor of Tamaulipas has said that all of those missing have been accounted for. Rescue workers used thermal imaging cameras to ensure no one remained under the rubble.
It is not yet clear what may have caused the collapse but the mayor of Ciudad Madero said it was probably due to ""structural failures"".
Ángel Vargas, the priest who was celebrating the baptisms when the collapse occurred said that a day of celebration had turned into a tragedy.
""They came to search for heaven for the little ones and found eternity. I want the families to find peace. All of this is unfathomable.""
Local journalist Franc Contreras told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme that the collapse happened at a key moment in the service.
""People were lined up to take the communion - of course that's sort of the climax of the Catholic Mass - and that's when the roof came down on top of them; bricks, concrete, and of course steel support structures coming down on top of the people,"" he said.
He added that according to Red Cross officials the roof came down on pews in the church, allowing the possibility that anyone trapped there could survive in air pockets.
One of the survivors described her ordeal on social media.
Josefina Ramírez said she had been attending the baptism of her godchild when the roof came down.
""Thank God, I'm alive (...) I feared I would not see my beautiful family again (...) I don't know how we got out,"" she wrote.
Local media reported that one of the people trapped had managed to send a WhatsApp message which helped rescuers to find him.
Among those who died was reportedly a toddler and a couple with their eight-year-old son, Mexican newspaper Milenio reported.
The bishop of the diocese of Tampico, where the church is located, said he was praying for the victims. — BBC

"Hello and welcome to the details of Civilians trapped by fighting in Gaza and now with the details
Nevin Al Sukari - Sana'a - An Israeli tank rolls along a position as Palestinians flee Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip January 26, 2024, amid ongoing battles between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas. — AFP pic
PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES, Jan 27 — Thousands of civilians were trapped in southern Gaza by bombardment and fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters today, a day after the top UN court ruled Israel must prevent genocidal acts.
Growing alarm has focused on Khan Yunis, the biggest city in Gaza’s south, where the two main hospitals were barely functioning under the weight of the relentless bombardment and the press of thousands in need.
Witnesses reported more overnight strikes on Khan Yunis, the current epicentre of Israel’s assault on Gaza, and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said some of the dead and wounded had been taken to the city’s barely functioning Al-Amal hospital.
The strikes came after the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that Israel must prevent possible acts of genocide in its war against Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza.
The court, which has virtually no enforcement power, stopped short of calling for an end to the fighting but also said in its ruling that Israel must facilitate “urgently needed” humanitarian assistance.
“This is the first time the world has told Israel that it is out of line,” said Maha Yasin, a 42-year-old displaced Palestinian woman in Gaza.
“What Israel did to us in Gaza for four months has never happened in history.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the case as “outrageous”.
Israel’s relentless bombardment and siege of the Palestinian territory began soon after Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attacks that resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages and Israel says around 132 of them remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 dead captives.
Israel has vowed to crush Hamas and the health ministry in Gaza says the Israeli military offensive has killed at least 26,083 people, about 70 per cent of them women and children.
Hospital services ‘collapse’
Fierce fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters has raged for days around Khan Yunis, forcing tens of thousands to flee further south to Rafah on the border with Egypt.
With a humanitarian crisis growing in Khan Yunis and northern areas of Gaza, UN agencies say most of the estimated 1.7 million Palestinians displaced by the war are crowded into Rafah.
At Khan Yunis’s Nasser Hospital, the largest in the besieged city, Doctors Without Borders said surgical capacity was “virtually non-existent”.
The international medical aid organisation said in a news release that medical services at the hospital had “collapsed” and the few staff who remained “must contend with very low supplies that are insufficient to handle mass casualty events”.
World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on social media platform X that 350 patients and 5,000 people displaced by the fighting remained at the hospital and that fighting in the vicinity continued.
He said the Nasser Hospital was “running out of food, fuel and supplies” and called for an immediate ceasefire so they could be replenished.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Israeli tanks were targeting Al-Amal hospital, another of the few remaining medical facilities in Khan Yunis, and that it was “under siege with heavy gunfire”.
The Israeli military accuses Hamas of having tunnels under hospitals in Gaza and of using the medical facilities as command centres.
Meirav Eilon Shahar, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, accused the WHO this week of collusion with Hamas by ignoring Israeli evidence of Hamas’s “military use” of Gaza hospitals.
Tedros rejected the accusation, saying it could “endanger our staff who are risking their lives to serve the vulnerable”.
Diplomatic relations sour
Relations between Israel and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees soured after the UNRWA said tanks had shelled one of its shelters in Khan Yunis on Wednesday, killing 13 people.
UNRWA said yesterday it had sacked several employees accused by Israel of involvement in the October 7 attack.
The UN Security Council will meet on Wednesday to discuss the ICJ’s ruling, the council’s presidency announced.
The European Union called for the “immediate” application of the ICJ’s decision.
The ruling in The Hague was based on an urgent application brought by South Africa, long a supporter of the Palestinian cause, but a broader judgment on whether genocide has been committed could take years.
A security source told AFP yesterday that the head of the US Central Intelligence Agency will meet officials from Israel, Egypt and Qatar “in the coming days in Paris” to try to reach a deal with Hamas.
A week-long truce in November saw an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, however the White House warned that “imminent developments” are unlikely.
The war has led to fears of wider conflict, and US forces said they had struck a target in Huthi-held Yemen after an attack on a British tanker in the Gulf of Aden. — AFP

"Hello and welcome to the details of Holocaust survivor hails ‘wonderful’ German anti-right protests and now with the details
Nevin Al Sukari - Sana'a - Holocaust survivor Eva Szepesi, who was liberated from Auschwitz at the age of 12, told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, his cabinet and MPs in a Bundestag ceremony that she was heartened by hundreds of thousands of Germans joining pro-democracy rallies. — AFP pic
BERLIN, Jan 31 — Holocaust survivor Eva Szepesi today welcomed mass German protests against the resurgent far right but said stronger action was crucial to stand up to rising anti-Semitism.
Szepesi, who was liberated from Auschwitz at the age of 12, told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, his cabinet and MPs in a Bundestag ceremony that she was heartened by hundreds of thousands of Germans joining pro-democracy rallies.
“It is wonderful that so many people took to the streets in recent weeks to demonstrate against right-wing extremism,” Szepesi, 91, told the chamber.
“However I wish these demonstrators would also loudly object to inhumane and anti-Semitic remarks from their acquaintances and at work,” she added, invoking a “responsibility” to confront hatred where it arises.
She said Germany’s “wonderful constitution and democracy” deserved defending against forces seeking to undermine them, without mentioning the far-right AfD party by name.
The AfD, which has soared in opinion polls since last summer to around 20 percent on the back of fears about economic decline and rising migration, had largely boycotted last year’s Holocaust Memorial Commemoration in parliament.
The party’s leaders and MPs however were in attendance for Szepesi’s speech and applauded with other lawmakers as she called on Germans to resist “remaining silent and looking away” in the face of extremism.
Szepesi, born in Budapest to a Jewish family, was sent to the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz at the age of 11 and was one of the few child prisoners to escape death in the gas chambers.
She said she had taken advice to lie about her age, telling guards she was 16, which had likely saved her life.
Prisoners who were deemed unfit to work were systematically murdered immediately on arrival, a fate that her mother and brother had met at the camp.
After the war, Szepesi and her husband, a fellow Holocaust survivor, settled in Germany due to Cold War upheaval in Hungary.
She thanked Scholz and his government for their “solidarity” with Israel after the deadly Hamas attacks in October.
But she expressed alarm about the sharp rise in anti-Semitic crimes recorded in Germany since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out.
“It worries me deeply and I am sad to see what is happening on the streets—the readiness to use violence and the hatred of Jews,” she said. — AFP

Jeddah - Yasmine El Tohamy - Saudi Arabia calls for end to bloodshed and Israeli military escalation in Gaza: Finance minister
RIYADH: Saudi Arabia demands an end to Israeli military operations and bloodshed in Gaza, Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan reiterated during a G20 virtual summit on Wednesday, Saudi Press Agency reported.
Al-Jadaan, who represented the Kingdom at the summit, emphasized the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He said that Israel’s violence in Gaza violated international law and had resulted in one of history’s worst humanitarian catastrophes.
He said that Israel’s violations of international law and UN resolutions jeopardized the international system’s credibility and could have far-reaching consequences. The minister reiterated Saudi Arabia’s strong stance against the targeting of civilians, infrastructure, residential areas and medical facilities in Gaza, as well as its concern about the displacement of Palestinians from the besieged enclave.
Saudi Arabia reiterated its call for an immediate cease-fire and an unimpeded flow of humanitarian and medical supplies to Gaza.
The Kingdom advocated a long-term peaceful solution that guaranteed the Palestinian people’s legitimate rights, including the establishment of an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.The virtual summit, held under India’s presidency, served as a follow-up to the in-person G20 summit held in New Delhi in September.
Other discussions focused on the role of multilateral banks in development, climate action, green financing, technological transformation, digital infrastructure and women’s empowerment.
During the summit, Al-Jadaan emphasized the importance of global cooperation in addressing climate change, as well as the need to leverage cutting-edge technologies, such as the circular carbon economy approach, to effectively manage carbon emissions and achieve climate goals.
Al-Jadaan also highlighted the issue of rising global debt and the growing pressures that many countries are facing.

"Thank you for reading the news about Spain win 25th straight qualifier at home to keep Scotland from clinching spot in Euro 2024 and now with the details
Jeddah - Yasmine El Tohamy - ABIDJAN: Hosts Ivory Coast were joined in Group A by Nigeria in the draw for the Africa Cup of Nations in Abidjan on Thursday.
Fast-improving Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, who have qualified for a fourth straight edition, complete the mini-league.
Other heavyweight pairings included defending champions Senegal with five-time winners Cameroon, while Africa’s first World Cup semifinalists Morocco face the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Ivory Coast, seeking a third Cup of Nations title, will meet Guinea-Bissau in the opening match on Jan. 13 in Abidjan, the economic hub.
The Ivorian clash with three-time champions Nigeria will attract most attention among the six Group A fixtures.
Nigeria were last crowned Cup of Nations winners in 2013 in South Africa and the Ivory Coast succeeded them two years later in Equatorial Guinea.
Morocco were drawn in Group F with DR Congo, Zambia and Tanzania.
The Atlas Lions have won the premier African football competition only once, in 1976. Their best performance since then was finishing runners-up to 2004 hosts Tunisia.
Defending champions Senegal are in Group C with five-time winners Cameroon, Guinea and the Gambia.
South Africa will face Tunisia, Mali and Namibia in Group E while Ghana take on Egypt, Cape Verde and Mozambique in Group B.
Group D, comprising Algeria, Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Angola, completes the lineup for a tournament that will reach a climax with the final on Feb. 11.
Senegalese-American singer Akon hosted the draw, assisted by current and former African stars Sadio Mane, Achraf Hakimi, Didier Drogba and Mikel John Obi.
Ivory Coast are hosting the premier African sport event for a second time, and hoping for much better results than in 1984.
Then, the Elephants began with a convincing victory over Togo, but losses to Egypt and eventual champions Cameroon meant elimination after the first round.
It was the only time in nine hostings of the Cup of Nations in west Africa that the home country failed to reach the knockout stage.
Just eight nations featured in that edition — — a third of the number who will arrive in the west African country for the next edition.
The tournament should have taken place already as it was originally scheduled for June and July this year.
But had it gone ahead, matches would have been staged during the rainy season and CAF president Patrice Motsepe said “it was too great a risk to play matches in potential downpours.”
He admitted moving the two-yearly tournament to January and February was “not ideal as it clashes with the European club season.”
This means stars like Mohamed Salah of Liverpool and Victor Osimhen of Napoli could be absent from their clubs for five weeks, depending on how record seven-time champions Egypt and Nigeria fare.
Ivory Coast will stage the Cup of Nations at six stadiums — two in Abidjan and one each in Bouake, administrative capital Yamoussoukro, Korhogo and San Pedro.
Friendly fixtures meant many coaches, including Aliou Cisse of Senegal and Rigobert Song of Cameroon, were unable to attend the draw.
Ivory Coast (hosts), Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau
Egypt, Ghana, Cape Verde, Mozambique
Senegal (holders), Cameroon, Guinea, Gambia
Algeria, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Angola
Tunisia, Mali, South Africa, Namibia
Morocco, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Tanzania
— Group winners and runners-up and the four highest ranked third-placed teams qualify for knockout stage.
— Tournament kicks off on January 13 and ends on February 11, with matches at six stadiums in five cities.

"Classifying your genre will be one of the first things you do. However, this may not be as simple as it sounds. Many novels, scripts and other works of art will combine elements of more than one genre within the story that is told. However, there will still be one main genre that flows steadily throughout your story (or series).
I watched Reign on Netflix. This series is classified as a Costume Drama. The main character is Mary Queen of Scots so some might say it is a Period Drama or Historical fiction, but to make compelling viewing the gripping storylines are fictional and I’ve seen it described as Fan Fiction. In addition, there is a lot of Political Drama and Religious Conflict. Many of the storylines are romantic making it Romance fiction.
Sometimes the genre can be tricky to pinpoint as the definitions can be confusing and sound similar to each other.
I’ve had this issue trying to understand what is Magical Realism’? Or, what’s the difference between Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance? Then, some genres are based on the target audience of the reader i.e. by age (MG, Tween, YA, etc) or gender (Chick Lit) or personal identification (LGBTQ, Multicultural).
To tackle this, I suggest looking up the definitions online from more than one source. Also, check how novels similar to yours have been classified. Read novels of the genres you are considering and see which feels most similar to yours.
It is important to get this correct to enable the right readers to find your novel.
What if it is many genres?
Say you’ve written a YA, Historical Horror with a cross-dressing African bi-sexual and all the genres remain strong throughout the novel?
Then you have to ask yourself how similar novels have been classified or which market you feel your novel will thrive most strongly (i.e. if there is a current demand for Horror fiction, perhaps place it there).
Write for Kids has an article that goes into more detail on this subject – click here.
- MG (Middle grade): For age 8 to 12. Length = 100 to 150 pages. The main character should be of a similar age. These books often form large series as children of this age will bond with the character and form an attachment.
- Tween: For age 10 to 14. Length = around 150 pages. The main character should be of a similar age. These books are for children who have outgrown MG but are not ready for YA:
- Young Adult: For age 12+. Length = 150 to 225 pages. The main character should be of a similar age, although due to the more mature theme the protagonist is often cast in their final year of high school:
- Coming Of Age: This fiction will deal with the struggles of the protagonist going from being a child to becoming an adult.
- Chick Lit: Literature for young women. The story will relate to the struggles young women face in a humorous way (i.e. dating, health, careers, finance, etc).
- LGBTQ: The story will revolve around a character that is either lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender or questioning their sexuality.
- Multicultural: Books about people of colour and first/native nations.
These are the main genres most people think of when classifying fiction:
- Adventure: Often involves the characters being in danger and going through a series of events on a journey to reach their goal.
- Romance: The novel usually follows a couple falling in love, often with lots of misunderstanding or barriers to give the story a journey.
- Erotica: The novel will have steamy scenes as this is what the reader is investing in. Usually, there is a romantic plot to carry the story along but not necessarily important.
- Horror: The novel should be scary and make you want to sleep with the light on. The idea is to strike fear into the reader and the characters.
- Crime/Detective: Usually involves a murder but could be any crime. The protagonist could be trying to catch the culprit or could be the criminal.
- Mystery: Involves following clues to solve a crime or to find out information.
- Fan Fiction: The stories are based on characters from other artists works (i.e. Film, TV Show, Book, Play, etc) or famous people (i.e. a boy band, a royal, or an actress).
- Suspense/Thriller: This story should have you sitting on the edge of your seat as you join the characters in evading whatever is lurking in the shadows after them.
- Comedy/Humour: Written in an entertaining way with the goal of making the reader laugh.

- Historical: The story is set in a historical period of time – it is important to do your research to ensure you get your facts correct.
- Western: Set in the American wild west between the eighteenth and nineteenth century.
- Ghost/Supernatural: Story will challenge the fabric of our world. It often includes elements of other genres but the main focus is usually ghosts, spirits, demons, possessions and witchcraft.
- Fantasy: Characters are set in an otherworldly setting. The story would not work in our world.
- High Fantasy: The races and the world is made up. The main character is often a hero on a quest, usually good vs evil. Often includes battles involving combat or magic. This is your traditional classification.
- Hard Fantasy: This involves heavy world building. The story will have a thoroughly developed world with geography, law, languages and reasons for why things are or are not (think Tolkien)
- Techno Fantasy: Has the heart of fantasy but has a strong technology vibe. This could be through using technology to create something or someone. It could be where technology has come to life, for example, a car with a mind of its own.
- Urban Fantasy: The story is set in the real world (usually present but can be set in the past or future). The story usually involves fantasy characters i.e. another race, species or paranormal or supernatural beings.
- Paranormal Romance: Usually involves a romantic relationship between a human and supernatural (i.e. a vampire, witch, shapeshifter, ghost, time travel or someone with psychic abilities). Themes will mix with fantasy, science fiction and sometimes horror.
- Magic Realism: Story involves magic or supernatural but presented within a realistic environment. The magic events are ordinary occurrences and not explained. There is something deeper connected to enlightening your mind of conventional constraints.
- Science Fiction: Often set in the future or on another planet. The story is based on scientific ideas or imagined ideas.
- Hard Science Fiction: The story will be supported by scientific facts and theories making the story more realistic and possible.

Jewel of the sea
My novel Jewel of the sea (formerly Drift) is:
- YA fiction: This is because my protagonist is a fifteen-year-old girl. She does turn sixteen within the novel and there is scope for a series.
- Coming of Age: She starts her period, learns to wear makeup, has her first kiss, etc. Then there are all the firsts with her changing body… like becoming a mermaid.
- Romance: The plot is driven by her crush on her best friend who is dating Kya. Kya’s brother (hot swim team captain and Mariah’s nemesis) offers to help break the couple up if she’ll kiss him – let’s just say it gets complicated.
- Paranormal romance: She doesn’t know she is a mermaid and able to shift between her human and mermaid form. And she has weather manipulation powers. Plus the complicated romance (see above).
- Urban Fantasy: The fantastical elements are set in a real world environment – it is loosely based around my hometown.
- Novel: Currently it is 80k but I am constantly revising it.
I have classified it as a YA Urban Fantasy Novel.

"Take about thirty people in charge of mountain environment education in the Alpine protected areas and draw them deep into an Alpine valley for 3 days, at an altitude of 1,800 m, in a refuge with neither Internet connection nor telephone network. Once there, encourage them to exchange and collaborate in a Workshop about their day-to-day work; sprinkle with curiosity, good humour and work in the open. What will result?
An explosive force, made up of creativity, a willingness to share skills and experiences, a desire to establish links, to face up to the challenges and priorities of mountain environment education, to valorise one’s experiences and learn from each other.
Such was the experience shared by about thirty participants from the 6 Alpine countries during the 4th “Mountain Environmental Education in the Alpine Protected Areas” International Workshop, which was held in the Refuge de Bayasse in the Mercantour National Park (France) from 18th to 20th October 2016.
The participants, most of whom are long-term members of the “Mountain Environmental Education” Working Group, had the opportunity for exchanging and sharing , but also for working together on various themes (e.g. “biophilia”, visitor centres, educational messages and the attitudes of young people towards parks…) and on collective projects currently in progress. Notably, one main event was devoted to the “Youth at the Top” initiative which originated from this group: the assessment of the 2016 edition was followed by reflection about improving and perpetuating the operation and preparing the editions to follow. Throughout the meeting the participants helped to finalise the “The Alps in my Backpack” teaching tool (a large format map of the Alps printed on fabric) which will have its first outings in the field in 2017.
A Common Quest: How to (re) establish Links between Young People and Nature
One of the guiding principles of some of the informal debates and workshops was the question as to how the link youth-nature can be (re) established .This question was approached from several angles: from the role played by the mountain environment educator and from the message they can carry, to the role of teachers and the structure of school curricula. “This subject has been a topic of discussion in the French education group for several years,” declared Isabelle Roux, the Head of the Educ’Alpes Network. “For our network, mountain education rests on 3 pillars: encouraging youngsters to enjoy contact with nature, favouring games and free times, and creating experiences from mountain slope”. A vision which ALPARC shares entirely.
Thus the workshop was the opportunity for discovering and trying out innovative approaches in non-formal education. This was the case during the field workshop devoted to interpretation and led by Markus Blank of the Gesäuse National Park (Austria), representing the Interpret Europe association. Heritage interpretation is an approach where the goal is to provide a different way of seeing and a deeper understanding through first-hand experience of sites, objects or events linked to a particular heritage. It is very widespread in the United States and has been growing popular in Europe over the past few years.
The results of the meetings: a report, PowerPoints, shared resources, photos, etc. are being made available progressively as they become available on the ALPARC extranet, in the workspace devoted to this working group. www.alparc.org/extranet
A big thank you to those who took part, to all who helped to make the workshops so lively and notably the Mercantour National Park for their enthusiastic hosting!
The Workshop was organised by ALPARC in partnership with Educ’Alpes and the Mercantour National Park and was funded by the Principality of Monaco.
These meetings are held every two years: rendezvous in autumn 2018 in Italy or Slovenia!

"Holistic Mind Strength: Nurturing Mental Fitness for Wellness
In the fast-paced world we live in, nurturing mental fitness is crucial for overall well-being. Holistic mental fitness emphasizes a comprehensive approach that goes beyond traditional practices. Let’s delve into the key elements and strategies for cultivating a strong and resilient mind through holistic mental fitness.
Understanding Holistic Mental Fitness
Holistic mental fitness recognizes the intricate connection between mind, body, and spirit. It involves adopting a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of your life to promote mental well-being. This understanding forms the foundation for cultivating a resilient and balanced mind through holistic practices.
Mind-Body Connection in Mental Fitness
The mind-body connection is a central focus of holistic mental fitness. Practices such as yoga, tai chi, and mindful meditation emphasize the integration of physical and mental well-being. These activities not only enhance physical flexibility but also contribute to mental clarity, stress reduction, and emotional balance.
Nutrition and Mental Well-Being
Holistic mental fitness extends its reach to nutrition, acknowledging the impact of diet on mental health. A balanced and nourishing diet with essential nutrients supports cognitive function and emotional well-being. Incorporating whole foods, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids contributes to a holistic approach to mental fitness.
Emotional Resilience through Holistic Practices
Building emotional resilience is a key aspect of holistic mental fitness. Practices like mindfulness, meditation, and breathwork help individuals develop a greater awareness of their emotions. This heightened awareness enables effective coping strategies, fostering emotional resilience in the face of life’s challenges.
Holistic Therapies for Mental Well-Being
Holistic mental fitness embraces a variety of therapeutic approaches beyond conventional methods. Art therapy, music therapy, and nature therapy are examples of holistic modalities that engage individuals in creative and sensory experiences. These therapies promote self-expression and emotional healing, contributing to mental well-being.",<urn:uuid:bd7e9429-95b0-4c16-87d6-066e1fdcd9f7>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://alternativemediasyndicate.net/tag/nutritionalwellness,2024-02-20T21:57:18Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.869240939617157,397,2.6818838119506836,3

"Does Womanhood and Ambition Really Exist in Nigeria?
(L.A. McKeown, 2020)
“We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller. We say to girls, you can have ambition, but not too much. You should aim to be successful, but not too successful. Otherwise, you would threaten the man” -Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
Who is your role model? They ask as if there is a perfect example of someone I could emulate around me? As a young woman raised within a community where being successful feels like a destination for the only perfect people, I have constantly studied the women figure around with these constant questions in mind “Are they living the goals and dreams they had as young women or has womanhood and motherhood robbed them of those aspirations” “Are they the perfect examples of role models?” “I mean, they do not have big titles?” “They are mothers who have accepted what society gave to them?” “Are they fighting for what they believe, or has life just happened?”
A role model is a person someone identifies as a person they can gain inspiration from and emulate specific characteristics from (Australia’s National Career Information Service, 2021). Synonyms being hero, heroine, idol, and icon. Based on this definition and the various examples fellow students give when asked who their role models are, the women around me were no close to being role models. I mean, they do not look successful, nor were they a big deal, nor do they have a description of who I hope to be, but why do I feel this way?
Suppose you know that feeling that comes with constant correction on who you are meant to be. In that case, I believe you will understand where I am coming from when I say it felt like the women around me did not feel confident enough to own their space; from a young age, my mum and aunt constantly corrected me on how to eat, what to do and what not to do, the amount of food that seemed alright and most importantly who I was going to be for him, I mean they were taught to live for their husband. In the country I come from, Nigeria, womanhood ended up at who you are to your husband and the kind of mother you are to your children. It always felt as if the women around accepted who they were meant to be for society’s sake. Furthermore, I have never seen my mum ask or question certain things; I have not asked her why it is that way or if she is satisfied but really, who can be satisfied with all that is offered to them without question. I do not mean to say my mum is mute or does not have a life. I have never seen her live life for herself, which has led to my constant worry about being a mother, wife, or woman in general. So does womanhood and motherhood rob you of being who you hope to be? or is it just wrong in general to have aspirations and dreams as a woman?
Womanhood is beyond the physical body parts; It is a state of mind as well as a social commitment; women serve as a moral compass and sounding board for spouses, friends, and family; women believe in fighting for what is right (Dr. Logan Levkoff, 2011).
It is quite iconic to know that in Nigeria, you become a woman when you begin your menstrual flow; It brings smiles to the faces of your loved ones and joy to their hearts knowing that at one point in life, you can be given to a man in marriage and then bear children for him. In Nigerian definition, womanhood is being fit enough to live for another person, in this case, your children or husband. In 2015 Florence Warmate, after a book club meeting where they discussed Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s “We Should All Be Feminists,” decided to embark on a journey of exploring challenges facing women; she started a tweet using the hashtag #BeingFemaleinNigeria and soon, a lot of people began to respond from this experiment, various women spoke about the stereotypes they faced within their families and in the workspace (BBC Trending, 2015).
According to the world bank blog, as of 2011, 17 million adult women in Nigeria were neither working nor studying (The work of women in Nigeria, 2016), I mean who wants to invest in a person who one day is going to live their life for someone else, the thought that girls, upon marriage, join their husband’s family and take with them the benefits of education, makes parents have little incentives to bear the costs of educating their daughters (King & M. Anne Hill, 1995).
You know I love this quote from one of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Ted’s talks, “We should all be Feminist,” in this particular talk. She talks about being female within Nigerian society. This Ted talk was from years back; however, many of the issues she highlighted are still relevant today. She said, “We say to girls, you can have ambition, but not too much. You should aim to be successful, but not too successful. Otherwise, you would threaten the man. Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage. I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important” (Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Quotes (Author of Americanah), 2020).
In Nigerian societies, womanhood is associated with compromise; many women and girls from the early stage of life have been told to let go of various things to satisfy others’ needs, in most cases boys and men. As of 2018, seventy percent of Nigerian women were married. This seventy percent included women from the ages of 15 to 49 years were married, and from the remaining 30 percent, 25 percent never married (Nigeria: marital status of women Statista, 2018). For those 25 percent of unmarried, many of them have endured pity and blame for their situation. In Nigeria, singleness beyond marriage age for women is seen as wrong, many of these women are called women with the worst of behavior, their love for self cost them their happiness, quote on quote, marriage, they were too ambitious, they have pride, and that is why a man can’t marry them. The sigma is then for you to have ambition, live your life and have dreams, then you become a strong-headed proud woman who no man can control. So then the question is, were my aunt and mother wrong for living by society standard? No, I do not think so, but then my worry is why do most women live at peace with society and others at the expense of losing themselves, why do most womanhood and motherhood steal from women’s ambition, dreams, and personal goals?
(World Bank Report, 2019)
The limitations and stereotypes put in place by society do not only affect personally identity crises but also plays out how women are able to contribute to society, in a survey done by the Global Women Entrepreneur Leadership Scorecard in 2015 Nigeria ranked high in terms of women who believe they have the skills to become entrepreneurs, but last in terms of ‘economic climate’ for women (2015 Global Women Entrepreneur Leaders Scorecard Executive Summary, 2015) and this in terms affect the livelihood of women in Nigeria. Another aspect to consider is that many women leave the workforce just because according to society women can not balance the two out and therefore she has to choose what is most important to her. Globally 46.9% of all women participated in the labor force (Statistical Overview of Women in Global Workplaces: Catalyst Quick Take, 2020). That’s to show how many of these limitations affect the representation of women.
In spite of the societal focus that has limited women in Nigeria we have seen women on the raise who have then become role models to other women within the society for example Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former Finance Minister and Vice President of the World Bank, and Dr. Obiagele Ekwesili, former Education Minister and Head of the World Bank’s African Educational Project are among those who have broken the glass ceiling in their contributions to Nigeria’s economic and educational development (Nefi Ainesi Wole-Abu, 2018). More like the women that spoke about their experiences in 2015 using twitter many women need to begin to speak about the struggles of womanhood in Nigeria, it is also important that women speak about how these constructs within the society affect their goals and aspirations, it is not going to be a one day process of changing these beliefs systems. So it is essential that women begin to speak up starting with our immediate community about their struggles, hopes, and ambitions, but most important be role models to each other. Identify your struggles, be conscious and confident to share your stories.

"MTN Ghana Appoints New CEO. Stephen Blewett has been named the new CEO of MTN Ghana by the MTN Group.
After a stellar performance as Ghana’s CEO, Selorm Adadevoh was replaced by Stephen, who was recently elevated to Group as the Chief Commercial Officer (GCCO).
At the moment, Stephen Blewett works for the MTN Group as an operations executive in the markets. However, on April 1, 2024, he will become leadership of MTN Ghana.
The recently appointed CEO of MTN Ghana returned to the company in July 2023 and assumed the role of Operations Executive for Markets, overseeing the Group’s smaller West and Central African markets and assisting the Senior Vice President for Markets with more comprehensive operations support throughout the region.
He had previously served as Chief Operating Officer of Digicel, an organization that Selorm also quit to join MTN. Prior to that, he worked with MTN for seven years, first as CEO of MTN Benin and later as CEO of MTN Cameroon.
MTN Ghana Board Chairman Dr. Ishmael Yamson said, “We are happy to have Stephen join the MTN Ghana family and look forward to working with him to move the company forward to achieve our Ambition 2025 strategy and beyond.”
“We also welcome Stephen to the MTN Ghana family and look forward to welcoming him to the business in the months ahead,” the MTN Ghana board of directors stated.
Concurrently, Selorm succeeds Jens Schulte-Bockum, who relinquishes his position as Group Chief Operating Officer upon the expiration of his contract in March 2024.
Selorm is going to join the MTN Group Executive Committee in his new role.
According to an MTN statement, Jens Schulte-Bockum will leave his executive position on March 31, 2024, but he will continue to serve as a non-executive director on the boards of three significant subsidiaries: MTN Nigeria, MTN South Africa, and Bayobab.
MTN Ghana Appoints New CEO Stephen Blewett
“We extend our congratulations to Selorm on his new role and express our gratitude for his exceptional leadership, guidance during difficult times, and tireless efforts over the previous five and a half years on behalf of MTN Ghana. We are confident that he will succeed in his new position, according to Dr. Ishmael Yamson.
As the CEO of MTN Ghana, Selorm joined MTN in 2018. Prior to then, he had a number of important positions in the USA, UK, and Latin America at different points in his career, as well as important positions with Millicom in Africa and Caribbean mobile network operator Digicel.
Since joining MTN, Selorm has spearheaded the company’s transformation and played a key role in advancing the company’s new Ambition 2025 strategy, which aims to position MTN Ghana as a platform player. He has had a considerable effect and impact on important industry projects.
Along with thanking Selorm for his enormous contribution to the company during his time as CEO, the Board of Directors of MTN Ghana and its subsidiaries also wished him luck in his new position as MTN Group Chief Commercial Officer.
With a market share of more than 70% in voice, internet, SMS, and mobile money, MTN Ghana is the sole major player in the business. Due to its remarkable GHS1.7 billion plus profit after tax half-year 2023, over 26 million subscribers, over 14 million mobile money clients, and about 99% combined coverage of 2G, 3G, and 4G nationally, MTN—the only profitable telco in Ghana—reported its earnings for the first half of the year.
MTN is still spending billions of Ghanaian cedis on corporate social programs and network enhancements. In fact, MTN Ghana has set aside $1 billion for investments in Ghana between 2021 and 2025 as part of their Ambition 2025 plan, of which $25 million will go toward constructing the cutting-edge Ghana ICT Hub in partnership with the authority.
Being the only SMP on the market, MTN has been forced by the regulation to double its pricing this year alone and discontinue some of its most economical bundles. Despite the price hikes, it seems that customers are continuing to use the network because of its comparatively higher quality of service when compared to alternative options available.",<urn:uuid:fe77781d-ab07-453e-9416-83705bac80b5>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://amagabby.com/mtn-ghana-appoints-new-ceo-stephen-blewett/,2024-02-20T23:10:33Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9792247414588928,923,0.8208131790161133,1

"A sportsbook is a place where you can bet on sporting events, such as college and professional football games. These establishments are usually legal and offer a variety of betting options, such as money lines and over/under bets. They also have a customer service team to answer your questions. If you’re looking for the best sportsbook, make sure to read reviews and check out their game selections, betting odds, and security measures.
Sportsbooks make their money by charging a commission, known as the vigorish, on bets that lose. This is a standard practice for most sportsbooks, but the amount varies from one book to another. The higher the vigorish, the more profitable the sportsbook is. In addition, the sportsbook may also have a policy on payout amounts. This policy is especially important when making large bets.
Many factors influence the vigorish, including the amount of action on a particular bet, the type of bet, and the size of the winning bet. A high vigorish can be a good indicator of profitability, but it is not a guarantee of success.
The simplest way to bet on a game is by placing a straight bet, which simply places a wager on a team to win or lose. The odds on a straight bet are determined by the probability of the event occurring, and the sportsbook will set the odds accordingly. Bets on teams with high probabilities have a lower risk and will pay out less than those with low probabilities.
Odds on an NFL game begin taking shape almost two weeks before the kickoff. Each Tuesday, a handful of select sportsbooks release their “look ahead” lines, which are based on the opinions of a few smart sportsbook managers. These initial lines are typically just a thousand bucks or so: a substantial amount for most punters, but less than the typical pro would risk on a single NFL game.
As a result, the opening line for a game will often be heavily influenced by public sentiment. For example, if the majority of bettors are backing the Bears to beat the Lions, the sportsbook will move the line to discourage Detroit backers. This can be a great strategy if you’re able to identify the public sentiment on a game and then take advantage of it.
While there are many different types of bets, the most common are point spreads and over/under bets. Point spreads are a bet on how many points a team will win or lose by, while over/under bets are a bet on the total number of points scored in a game. Over/under bets are a popular choice for casual bettors, but they can sometimes be difficult to beat. In addition to examining the odds on over/under bets, it’s also important to consider other variables, such as how many field goals are kicked in a game and the average number of points scored by both teams. These variables can greatly affect the over/under odds for a game.",<urn:uuid:014bae8d-88c2-4c40-8b9f-c005169e6ad5>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://amazing-glutathione.com/how-to-bet-at-a-sportsbook/,2024-02-20T23:33:17Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9633126854896545,605,1.0546742677688599,1
"A slot is a place where coins or tokens are inserted into a machine to activate it. The machine then pays out according to a predetermined program. Slot machines are very popular in the gambling industry and are often referred to as the “kings of casino games.” They are known for their high payouts, varied bonuses, and unique features.
Despite their popularity, there are many things that people should keep in mind before they play a slot machine. For example, a player should always read the pay table and understand how the game works before making a deposit. This will help them avoid making mistakes and prevent losing money. It is also recommended that players choose a slot machine based on their preferences and not just on its odds of winning.
There are a variety of different types of slots available online. These include cluster pay slots (where players must form groups of matching symbols, typically adjacent to one another), multi-payline slots (where winning combinations are formed by lines running across the reels in various directions), and all-way slots (also known as 243-ways or 1024-ways). Some of these types of slots have additional special symbols, such as wilds, scatters, or bonus symbols. Some even have progressive jackpots!
Many of these special symbols and features make slots a fun and exciting form of entertainment. However, it is important to remember that winning at slot is not easy, and there are no guarantees of success. Some people spend a great deal of time playing slots, but they do not necessarily win any prizes. In fact, it is more common to lose than to win. However, some people do manage to win, and it is not uncommon for them to receive huge amounts of money.
Some people may wonder whether slot machines are designed to inveigle the player. Some believe that this is true, while others claim that the machines are not programmed to do so. Regardless of which view you take, it is essential to set a budget or bankroll before you start playing. This way, you can limit your losses and maximize your chances of winning.
Slots can be confusing for novices, so it is helpful to have a detailed description of how they work. These descriptions can be found in the pay tables of online casinos. These tables are usually located at the bottom of the screen and provide information on the symbols, paylines, and rules of the game. They can also include information on bonus rounds, jackpots, and free spins.
Pay tables were once printed on the glass of slot machines, but they have since been replaced by electronic screens. They still contain the same information, but they are now much easier to read. They also often include animations that help players understand the game’s mechanics.
It never ceases to amaze us how many slot players dive right into the game without reading the pay table! This is a mistake that can cost you big. You should always check the pay table before you begin spinning the reels, and it is a good idea to look for an icon that is close to the base of the game window. Ideally, this will launch a pop-up window with all of the necessary details.",<urn:uuid:3c21910e-0328-4fb2-9ab9-33fcd1fdb29b>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://amazing-glutathione.com/what-is-a-slot-machine-4/,2024-02-20T23:35:54Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9745796918869019,648,1.4675265550613403,1

"Dr. Fiona Citkin urges minorities and immigrants to work together to bring meaningful, positive change in the U.S. in her Huffington Post article, “Immigrants and Minorities of America, Unite!” Yes, there are many benefits to bringing minorities and immigrants together, but there are also numerous pushes & pulls involved in uniting them, in establishing their local-global connection. I have long maintained that “Harmonize NOT Homogenize” is key to our working together, but today’s highly emotional environment makes even this approach difficult.
For many career women success means achieving not just professional recognition but also a fulfilling family life and personal happiness. But what is the price is paid by a career women and other women leaders in the diversity of culture they represent? There are many different answers to this question and the diverse cultures are key. My answer comes from the perspective of a Latina working for a Fortune 500 company who also constantly feels the need to challenge cultural differences in leadership styles. At the same time, it’s coming from a person who looks for life work balance, whether that means enjoying time in the kitchen cooking my favorite traditional cuisine, or impressing upon my children the value and importance of their multicultural background.
Not long ago, Texas made history. It became a majority minority state. In other words, the minorities together make up more than 50% of the population. Here in Texas, diversity is a buzzword.

"My take on the state of affairs regarding your less-than-perfect rifle is this. What is done, is done. Why beat up the guy you chose to finish the rifle after you did 40% of the work, as some here so strenuously suggest? Will exacting a pound of flesh from him, make him discontinue his hobby or make you happier tomorrow? That would be a no, for me.
Yes, he should not have drilled out the ramrod hole. Now you simply need to have the crack filled with superglue as some here can expertly do or can oversee. Don't just wing it. The rifle is not seriously compromised, strength-wise, by this crack, in my opinion.
The triggers should be studied and likely removed for a repair, and I would leave this to someone knowledgeable in these triggers and this kit. Jim Kibler would be my first phone call here.
The lock screw could likely be straightened by someone, as I know I would try this for myself. Again, the repair requires experience. Or just buy a new screw, and no dry-firing without a flint properly fitted, please.
I don't sense despair on your part, and you need not either. You are on your way to a very nice rifle and you can learn from this experience, the advise and very many lessons on this site and give another kit a go sometime.

Great place for families. Reasonable prices, especially the family season pass. Excellent for little kids, even pre-toddlers, with a very spacious shallow end and excellent sight lines for worrisome parents... plus an always attentive retinue of lifeguards. One underrated aspect of thhis park is the immense open grassy space (3-4 acres ?) ... lots of room for families to set up chairs and blankets or sun tents, play frisbee or football, and still have room between each other.

Really nice water park! Lots of slides for kids. Volleyball court, big sand box, grassy area. Also they have a party room so you could have a childs birthday party or another event. They also have a concession stand with lots of stuff for reasonable prices! The only thing negative is there are not many chairs so on really hot busy days you will want to bring your own.
Fun for everyone. Zero entry and toddler fun slides up to tall water slide for the bigger kids. Play equipment, volleyball, picnic tables, grassy fields. All enclosed in chain link.
Do every customer a favor. Lower the price some and take some of your profits and buy a new radio antenna. It has sounded terrible for years. Its almost torture.
As far as waterparks go, Wakanda Waterpark is about average. I know a place just like it in Hastings, MN. They could do without those waiting periods though.

Terrific value! Can bring your own cooler for a picnic. Big slides for the big kids, zero depth for the little ones.
Lots of stuff for kids to do, play ground, volleyball courts, and water slides for little kids and big kids.
My daughter love it. 2nd time back, she came with daycare one day n wanted to come back there.
Family friendly. Easy access. Reasonable rates. Friendly staff. The restroom is lacking.
This is a small water park for the population of the city so it tends to get crowded.
Friendly staff and clean facility. Good toddler activities too.
Clean and very good life guards! Kids love it...
Lots of fun and a great place to cool off!
Great place to take your family

"Thomas Watson Hunster (1851-1929) was an accomplished artist and innovative art educator in Washington, DC. He taught art and served as Director of Drawing for African American public schools in the city's then-segregated system. Over his forty-eight year tenure, he became known as the ""Father of Art"" for developing—and constantly refining—an interdisciplinary art curriculum for every grade level, from kindergarten through Miner Normal School’s teacher training program. Generations of students learned to draw, a skill that he considered fundamental for understanding both one's self and the world. As Professor Hunster wrote in his 1899 annual report, ""I deem it unnecessary to discuss the benefits derived from the study of drawing; the general correlation of drawing with other studies all over the country testifies to its value in education.”1
Professor Hunster's visionary leadership included introducing industrial and manual arts classes eight years earlier than offered in the city's white public schools. Further, he created a museum within Miner Normal School because most art galleries and museum barred Black visitors. He displayed the work of pupils and peers alike in well-received annual art shows.
Professor Hunster primarily painted landscapes. However, he took up portraiture for a period to become more adept at detail before returning to still life paintings and his beloved landscapes.2 Hunster remained a practicing artist throughout his life, active not only in Washington, DC's art community, but also on national and international stages. He collaborated with Armstrong High School students to create nine dioramas depicting African American history for the Paris Exposition in 1900. He was also an architect of the Washington Public Schools display at the Jamestown Ter-Centennial in 1907. Student-made items and his own oil paintings showcased African American accomplishment in the arts, education, and vocational training. In both expositions, Professor Hunster used art to advance civil rights in settings where segregated displays paralleled social and legislative practice.
As Professor Hunster neared retirement, he designed a house and studio in nearby Ardwick, Maryland, a community created by African American professionals in Prince Georges County. Its wooded surroundings likely inspired many paintings, and the house's unique architecture lent itself to doubling as a gallery. Upon retiring in 1922, Professor Hunster was succeeded by Hilda Wilkinson Brown (1894-1981), a notable educator and artist in her own right.4 The prolific painter continued to create and exhibit artwork until his death on August 24, 1929.
A decade later, the Thomas W. Hunster Art Gallery was dedicated at the renowned Dunbar High School (formerly M Street School). A solo show at Howard University's Gallery of Art memorialized Professor Hunster with a centennial exhibition in 1951. Professor Hunster's paintings, along with paintings and marionettes made by his students, were on display at the Anacostia Community Museum's exhibition on M Street School principal Anna J. Cooper in 1981-82.

"Lacy Estelle is first and foremost a Jesus Follower. She is also a wife, a mother and An AD[H]D Woman. She began writing about encouragement, surviving an abusive relationship and parenting her ADHD kiddos (while having ADHD herself) back in 2017. Since then she’s published lots of content on those subjects on her original blog Mothering the Storm (LacyEstelle.com).
In 2018 she acquired the Blog An ADD Woman, from it’s original creator; Brenda Nicholson. Nicholson had since grown away from writing and teaching about ADHD in women, and wanted to pursue other passions. With the new site, and all it’s previous content Lacy did what most ADHD women do: She overanalyzed it, and procrastinated on utilizing it for 2 years.
Now, she’s decided to use the site to host her podcast, it’s show notes and any other events, tips, tricks, or inspiring content.
At the core of it all, Lacy is a woman. Just like you, who spent a large part of her life feeling like she was broken, or faulty. That she was careless, and lazy. Maybe even just a little dumb. But come to find out- she was wrong. She just had ADHD, was undiagnosed, untreated and was dealing with some insane stress from her impulsive, unchecked, unrestrained life choices.
Now she’s going to bare it all. Talk about it all. Discuss it all on her podcast, An ADD Woman.
Why? Because she wants women to know the truth about ADHD and womanhood. – and that is, you are a wonderful, amazing, capable, and inspiring woman. Period.

"We are now in a whole different era as of Covid-19 having its place in our lives. In these times when we have started to work from the house, distracting factors have increased considerably. But, counteracting those factors and fully concentrating is possible with the Pomodoro Technique!
We are here to answer all your questions such as ""What is Pomodoro? How to apply the Pomodoro Technique?"", with ""Pomodoro Technique in 5 points.""
1) What is Pomodoro? What does Pomodoro mean?
Pomodoro as a word is the combination of Italian ""pomo ""(fruit) and ""doro"" (gold) and actually means tomato. It is thought that this word, which was previously used as “pomo di moro” by the Italians, became “pomodoro” after being mistranslated by the English translators. Surprising, isn't it? You might be wondering what does a tomato have to do with the Pomodoro Technique. Well, because it was named after a tomato look-alike timer used in the kitchen.
2) What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time managing technique that makes you use your time more efficiently and focus better. It helps you define and manage your tasks better. It makes it possible for you to fully focus on your tasks by counteracting all the distraction factors completely. With the help of this technique which gamifies the work, you can complete your tasks on time without getting bored.
Who can apply the Pomodoro Technique?
If you are the kind of person who often complains ""I cannot start working"", ""I keep postponing what I need to do"", ""I cannot focus"", the Pomodoro Technique is just for you!
The Pomodoro Technique can be used by students, employees with long working hours, and professionals engaged in continuous production. In fact, this technique appeals to a fairly wide audience. The Pomodoro Technique, which will allow you to use your time efficiently, will also put your work in order.
3) How did the Pomodoro Technique come up?
Lack of attention, loss of concentration, and such problems are not inherence only for today's world. The Pomodoro Technique was invented by Francesco Cirillo, who has had problems focusing and finishing his tasks in the 1980s. Bored of his workload, Cirillo decided to focus on his work for only 10 minutes and kept the time with a tomato-shaped timer he found. Thus, the Pomodoro Technique was born.
Cirillo, later on, developed the technique further and published a book of about 130 pages on the Pomodoro Technique. But do not let this mislead you, although a 130-page book has been written about it, applying the Pomodoro technique is quite simple!
4) How to apply the Pomodoro Technique?
There are 6 core steps of the Pomodoro Technique developed by Cirillo:
- Select the task to complete.
- Set the Pomodoro timer for 25 minutes.
- Start working on the task.
- Tick up a piece of paper when the alarm goes.
- Take a break.
- If you have less than four ticks, that is, you have practiced less than four periods of the Pomodoro. Take a short break of 3 to 5 minutes, and return to Step 2 after the break.
- If you have applied the Pomodoro more than four times, proceed to Step 6.
- Give a long break of 15 to 30 minutes. After the break, repeat these six steps until you have finished your task.
What is a Pomodoro?
A Pomodoro is obtained when the time of work and rest are added together. After the four Pomodoros have been completed, there is a long break.
Things to consider while applying the Pomodoro Technique
It is important to set an alarm or timer in order not to exceed the working and resting minutes. You can increase or decrease your working minutes according to your own experience and attention span. And the most important point to be considered while applying the Pomodoro technique is to only work during working times and to only rest during resting times.
To increase your focus while working, you need to get away from anything that will distract you. It may be helpful to mute your phone, put it on the ""Do not disturb"" mode, or turn off notifications. In addition, you can also benefit from music that will increase focus.
During your rest period, you should be completely away from your work. In this regard, it will be beneficial for you to get away from the environment in which you are working.
Increase your productivity with the Pomodoro Technique
It is important to break up your tasks into smaller chunks to increase your productivity. In this way, you will not overestimate the work you are to do and get to work more easily.
You can combine the Pomodoro Technique with other productivity methods and increase your efficiency. You can as well benefit from the [Pomodoro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tatkovlab.pomodorolite&hl=tr&gl=US) [apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tatkovlab.pomodorolite&hl=tr&gl=US) to apply the Pomodoro Technique in the most efficient way.

Odysseus Quest - Bracelet
Odysseus Quest is an elegant bracelet that is specifically designed for people that prefer to go unnoticed.
Similar to the Ancient Greek Hero Odysseus, who most of the times tried to go unnoticed yet was one of the most effective heroes of Ancient Times, similarly, Odysseus Quest’s bracelet is designed to go as much unnoticed as possible.
Nevertheless, do not confuse something: this bracelet is a highly effective and a very powerful bracelet; do not let its “simple design” fool you.
Moreover, as Odysseus was considered one of the most intellectual heroes of Ancient Times similarly, Odysseus Quest focuses on the Third-Eye and the Crown Chakra.
Odysseus Quest focuses its energies in opening and helping you to grow the Third-Eye and the Crown Chakra. In other terms, it is a bracelet that is designed for people that want to successfully grow their spiritual faculties, as well as, to successfully explore the spiritual realms.
Odysseus Quest will aid you in a tremendous manner in your explorations.
(for more details on how Odysseus Quest works, click on the tab called: Principles)
Before we begin, allow us to give you just one example, to help you understand, of how Odysseus Quest has been created:
Odysseus Quest invokes the triple powers of 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9; (2 and 3: Energy Vibration of Howlite and Amethyst).
Also, since the main focus of Odysseus Quest is to support you spiritual growth and advancement, as well as to help you to navigate through the spiritual realms:
2 - focuses on the balance of all aspects.
3 – connects the physical, mental and the spiritual faculties.
7 - focuses on your ascension towards the spiritual realm.
8 – focuses on the unity of the two aforementioned powers.
9 – focuses on the powers deriving from the spiritual realm towards you.
Going one step further:
From a mystical standpoint Odysseus Quest combines the following aspects (for more details click on the tab called “Mysteries”):
The power of Colours:
Violet and White (Spirituality, connection to higher self, higher realms).
The power of Numbers:
2, 3, 7, 8 and 9 (2 and 3: Energy Vibration of Howlite and Amethyst).
Spiritual Growth and Advancement:
Odysseus Quest energy infusion focuses on boosting the powers of your Third-Eye and the Crown. It is the ideal bracelet for spiritual growth and advancement, for exploring the astral and spiritual realms and to extend into advanced spheres of consciousness.
Enchantments – Energy Infusion:During the entire creation process, protection chants and protection spells are utilized so as to additionally infuse the bracelet’s gemstones with specific types of energies. Consequently, Odysseus Quest turns into the absolute protection for you.
Three Initial Key Points on Protection:
Firstly, know that love is the greatest protector. Protection involves utilizing love in as purer form as possible, for with love you can effectively construct a brick wall around you that negative forces cannot penetrate. Furthermore, negative entities cannot stand when positive vibrations hold strong because they start to polarize toward the positive (they turn positive), and that's the last thing they want. So, always approach protection with the highest intent in love and light, because using negative emotion will act like a magnet for further darkness to feed upon. For example, if you shout back at an angry person then the argument escalates. Behave calmly and with love toward an angry person and they will likely calm down. The negative energy diffuses and dissipates.
Secondly, know that in higher realms of existence (that's higher densities and within time-space) thoughts become reality. Thought-forms can be created through visualization such as walls or protective bubbles of light, doorways for negative entities to leave though, or in-streaming healing energy into your body. All these have a high probability of manifesting through your strong intent and effective visualization - they manifest on the other side and are used in this physical reality seen through your third eye.
Thirdly, also know that coupled with visualization; intention (or belief) is key - they work together to create thought forms and manifestations that can be used for spiritual protection. For example, you visualize a glowing white protective orb around you and your intention is for it to protect you from negative forces. Without the intention, the visualization is merely a pretty orb - you must assign it a purpose.
As a Side Note:
If you want to go completely Overkill against all negativity (etheric and negative astral entities, toxic people, to boost your energies in a significant manner, to influence the Karma of your life and to step into the fields of clairvoyant... combine our bracelets with our orgonites and witness it all).
Our bracelets and orgonites are to protect and to support, in their endeavours, people that have not succumbed into the “dark side”. For instance, if you are a toxic person than the spells and charms will turn against you and protect the ones that are meant to be protected by them.
About the Quality of our products:
We use quality materials in our products (i.e. bracelets) such as a good grade of genuine natural gemstones and stainless-steel wire and clasps. Because our jewelry is not manufactured, we take the time to give you excellent beading and inspection. We keep you in mind as we design our products so the finished product is both durable and beautiful.
Finding your size and ordering a specific size:
To find your size lay a loose cord around your wrist and then lay on a flat ruler.
Consequently, if you wish for a specific size send us a message (or a note) when you order.
Why Authentic – Production Process The most important question that arises is: what differentiates our bracelets from the rest? The bracelets that you will find here are special for a plethora of reasons, which are: One: They are only handmade. Two: Their construction and assembling process is based on the Ancient Greek Mysteries. Three: They combine Ancient knowledge with the contemporary arts of protection. Four: Whenever a bracelet is created, it is done through protection chants and protection spells. Five: Specific gemstones are used for each bracelet so as to evoke specific effects. Six: The types of stones, the colour of the stones and the number of the stones, that are used for each bracelet, have a specific purpose. Nothings is done randomly! Seven: In order for “energy infusion” to occur, a specific and long process has to be initiated. Consequently, you can wear one or a combination of bracelets. Eight: All spells, chants, energy infusions, enchanting, invocations etc., are done during specific days, specific times, inside specific magical circles and by following a highly advanced esoteric procedure. And all that is done for each bracelet separately! We DO NOT cut any corners when it comes to energy infusion; and that is why we can make the claim of being totally authentic! Nine: For each bracelet to be completed / produced, it takes a lot of time; and that is, because specific steps have to be followed (if by any chance you happen to be a Wicca or Occult scientist… than, you are aware about the long process). Ten: If a bracelet is stored, until it can be send to you, it is stored inside specific magical spheres (if you are advanced in this area of expertise… than you understand what we are referring to). Eleven: Our know-how is based on over 30 years (!!!) of research and personal experience, and experimentation, of all the effects our bracelets can have. Twelve: We always follow up the order of our bracelets and are always available to our customers and to answer all of their questions (for that, go to our forum and under the section of “E-shop” you can ask us all relevant questions). Thirteen: Gradually, we will add articles - in our forums - that will allow you to attain a deeper understanding of our bracelets; and what makes them so special. |

Amethyst is the perfect stone for anyone whom is just now venturing off down the path of their spiritual journey.

Why Would You Use Amethyst? Amethyst is one of relatively few gemstones with the specific purpose of improving intellectual and cerebral thought. There are many stones that are purported to enhance psychic powers, and many more that improve emotional intelligence, but the numbers of stones that have specific positive effects on the intellect are much rarer. Perhaps this is because, for much of western culture, intellectual thought has been something that was highly praised as a skill that had to be learned in schools, and used as a status symbol among those who were wealthy enough to pursue higher education! While higher education is excellent (and amethyst won’t grant you intelligence all on its own) it can certainly help you to apply your intellectual powers to any situation you might face. It can help you think both soberly and critically about the situations you face, which will lead you to far greater success in handling them. It is worth remembering that Amethyst gained its name from the Ancient Greek word meaning “not intoxicated”. It was said to prevent against drunkenness, and that its bright colour came from the god of wine, Dionysus, pouring out his wine over a clear crystal in mourning. Because of this, amethyst has long been said to promote sobriety – both in the literal sense of preventing drunkenness, and in the metaphorical sense of developing an ability to think more clearly and not be clouded with emotion of any specific sort. That emotion might be blind optimism or blind pessimism, but either way, it is blind – and amethyst can help you open your eyes. This is a wonderful crystal to use if you frequently find yourself in situations where you are unsure how to take action because of your emotions. It is important to remember that emotions are a valid and necessary part of the human life experience, and they should not be discounted. At the same time, however, emotions can be dangerous, because everyone’s emotional response to the same situation will be difficult, and it can be very difficult to communicate emotions between people. Amethyst crystals will help you build the skill to critically analyze emotions, appreciate their weight and worth, and then choose whether to act on them, or whether to acknowledge their validity and then set them aside to act on intellectual decisions instead. How Will Amethyst Help You? Amethysts are the great problem-solvers of the crystal world. Because of their ability to help you cut through difficult situations and understand what you are really seeing in front of you, they make it possible to get through difficult choices and decision making processes as painlessly as possible. Because of this, amethyst is an invaluable crystal when you have to solve a difficult problem with others, especially one where emotions are running high – or one where, as is so often the case, lots of people are talking, but no one is listening, and no one really knows what’s going on. This happens more often than you’d expect, even in high positions in businesses, or between married couples! Amethyst will help you listen to other people’s concerns, and then formulate and clearly articulate solutions in a highly practical, helpful way. It will help you address every concern that is brought to the table in a way that is most effective for the interests of everyone involved. Amethyst crystals are also known for their rulership of the crown chakra. While there are dozens of stones associated with every chakra and amethysts are one of the best known for the crown. This is interesting, because the crown chakra is the chakra of spirituality, which many people (both religious and unreligious) see as diametrically opposed to the logical, even scientific thought that amethyst promotes. However, in reality, a critically engaged way of thinking is one of the best ways to reach higher philosophical understanding of the world. If you feel out of place in your spiritual community, perhaps due to feeling like you don’t really understand other people’s interpretations or spiritual experiences, then amethyst will help you come to an understanding of those that can lead you to a higher understanding of both yourself and the universe. Amethyst, Healing and Health Amethyst is an excellent crystal to enhance physical vitality, especially after chemotherapy, radiation, or pharmaceutical treatments. It’s an energizing healer on a physical level because it can strengthen the adrenal glands, the reproductive organs, and the heart. It can aid in the treatment of disorders that affect the lungs, pancreas, and spleen. It can also stimulate fertility and help in the treatment of conditions related to the reproductive system. Amethyst can work in strengthening the immune system. It can also help you achieve a speedy recovery from a severe illness. It can be effective when it comes to cell regeneration. Amethyst is a natural stress reliever and can also detoxify the body. Emotionally, amethyst is used in crystal healing to help heal personal losses and grief, bringing one gently past painful experiences. Amethyst has a gently sedative energy that can promote peacefulness, happiness, and contentment. It also is said to bring emotional stability and inner strength. This stability and strength not only helps one hold firm in one’s life, but it can enhance flexibility and cooperation. Amethyst and Wealth Amethyst is an excellent crystal to have when you’re serious about building your personal wealth, growing your business, or sharing your abundance with the people you love. It will foster creative output, brilliant ideas, and dedicated work. It’s the ideal crystal to put on your work table or office desk so that your productivity will be high. Amethyst will invite harmony in your professional relationships and prosperity in your financial life. Amethyst for Love and Relationships Amethyst can help manifest your true self rather than be influenced by others to conform to other people’s expectations. You will realize that only when you’re honest with yourself will you experience genuine happiness and satisfaction. This crystal’s energies will help you understand your own needs, wants, and desires in your relationship. You will know what truly makes you happy and just how you want to be loved or taken care of. Amethyst will stimulate your heart and open yourself up to more love. It will break down your walls, and it will release all your fears and worries about love. It can eliminate destructive actions and ideas and replace them with only affirmative, empowering, and uplifting ones. You will be more confident in sharing how you feel, and you will be looking forward to the future more. Amethyst can help you remove the lethargy in your relationship. With hard work and commitment, you will be able to restore what was lost and rekindle the passion that has been missing. It will get rid of grief, despair, anger, or defeat. It will soothe emotional wounds and alleviate the pain that comes with emotional trauma. Amethyst can help you confront your emotional issues and overcome them. It can bring your hidden or suppressed feelings to the surface so that something positive will take place. You will have a more honest communication, and you will be surrounded with compassionate energies. There will be more passion and engagement in your relationship. You will be feeling adored, admired, and appreciated. Amethyst energies can give you comfort when you need it. You will never feel alone because you will find a way to be happy and contented even if you are by your lonesome. You will know what to do when the hurt becomes unbearable, and you will know how you can stand up and move forward. Amethyst will help you demonstrate strength of heart and mind. You will not be deterred by a few bumps in the road and by the mountains that you need to climb. You will let your spirits be lifted up, and you will allow yourself to be happy. You will not dwell on the sadness and the hurt, but you will focus on the things that you want to manifest in your relationship. Amethyst will support your growth as a person and as a partner in life. It will reassure you that there’s no fear in endings or beginnings because they are all just a part of living and loving! Amethyst is also known to promote better relationships on an intellectual, cerebral level. If you feel that your relationship is physically fulfilling but perhaps you aren’t connecting with your partner in every way that you would like to, you can use amethyst to develop a stronger mental relationship. This will very quickly translate to an improved emotional relationship, since sharing thoughts and sharing emotions are intimately tied together. Also Note: Ancient Greeks also claimed that wearing amethyst near the navel prevented drunkenness or intoxication (and a bracelet allows you “in a way” to be close to your navel). |
The Power of Colors: Violet: Spirituality, connection to higher self, Goddess, insight, clarity, tension. Psychic ability, wisdom, divination, remove curses, healing, psychic work, business success, to influence people in power. Powerful color with the energies that can be difficult to manage.

Jupiter rules the purple-violet. The purple-violet crown chakra governs. Amethyst: A mystical color, amethyst opens intuitive channels. It protects the vulnerable and assists the humanitarian. It is the color of the evolved soul.
All purpose, unity, purity, cleansing, peace, balance, spirituality, healing, innocence, rain, magick involving young children, truth, consecration, balancing the aura. For each order, balance the aura, because all colors originate from white. Energy, security, stimulation, inspiration, destroys destructive energies, cleanses the aura. Provides protection when applied to others and direct. The Moon rules white. The White governs the third eye, along with indigo and silver. The power of Numbers: Related to polarity and duality. Think of balance – the yin and yang, light and dark, god and goddess. Two represents one of each thing, side by side. The second chakra connects to relationships – and not just with other people, but how we relate to our jobs, our stuff, our money, and so forth.
Often seen as the most magical number in many traditions. Connected to the triple goddess, the realms of land, sea and sky, or the physical, mental and spiritual needs of mankind. In some magical systems, three is a symbol of action and interaction, while in others it means just the opposite – passiveness and neutrality.
Related to lunar energy, connected to the moon, femininity, and workings related to intuition and wisdom. Thought forms and consciousness are represented by the number seven.
Nine is three times three, which makes it a triply powerful number in some systems. In many traditions, nine is associated with goddess energy. In some symbolism structures, nine indicates change and growth. In the Tarot, nines symbolize completion of a process. Three Initial Key Points on Protection: Firstly, know that love is the greatest protector. Protection involves utilizing love in as purer form as possible, for with love you can effectively construct a brick wall around you that negative forces cannot penetrate.

"We are very proud of the fact that we ship globally and reach almost any country in the world. To do so, we work with multiple suppliers, warehouses and shipping companies with a focus of providing speedy delivery to all corners of the earth. Delivery times vary depending on what products you order because that will determine which warehouse it will be picked, packed and shipped from.
Generally most of our shipments fall into 2 categories as far as the speed of delivery arrival:
- USA, Canada, Europe, & Australia - Between 15 and 30 business days
- Rest of the world - Between 15 and 30 business days
The above are of course estimations and average numbers. Your package may reach you faster or take a little longer. The important thing to note here is that once a package leaves one of our warehouses we have no control over the speed at which it reaches you. Once entered into the global logistics network we are relying on the work of international and domestic carriers who work very hard to move parcels around the world.
Covid - 19 Corona Virus
The global situation with Covid -19 is causing delays with all shipments as each country is in some form of lock down. Although the situation differs in each region, there are certain changes to protocols that affect the global logistics network as whole such as:
- Increased package screening including cleaning and spraying across various points in the journey.
- Social distancing and associated protocols related to how warehouse and logistics staff do their work.
- Staff shortages either because of people getting sick or people not being available to work due to the risks associated with it.
- Customs procedures changing which leads to an increased level of scrutiny for packages entering a country.
The above changes to the way packages are moving around the world results in a much slower delivery turn around than was previously possible. Each delay compounds as the issues exist at each point in the journey.
Please know that we are doing what we can to get orders through the system as quickly as possible, and we certainly appreciate our customers patience during this time, while the world adjusts to the situation.

Once we receive your order our warehouse staff will pick, pack and prepare the order for shipment. At that point a shipping label is issued and put onto the package, which results in a tracking number entering our system and an email from us being sent to you with the tracking link.
The carrier then collects the package from our warehouse and scans the label, at which point the tracking link starts to populate. This process can take up to 7 business days and is perfectly normal due to the work that goes into getting an order out of the warehouse and into the carrier's hands.
You can access the tracking link from your order record once logged into our website, or via the link our system would have emailed you.
The tracking data is not real time like you would expect to see when monitoring your Uber on it's way to you. Not every point in the journey gets scanned into the system, and as a result there will be gaps of several days in the data you see. This is totally normal as far as tracking goes and you have nothing to worry about if you don't see new data logged for a few days.
Packages do rarely, but sometimes get lost or for whatever reason stop moving through the global logistics system. In the event that you see no new tracking information for a period of 20 days from the last entry then please contact us. In these situations we go back to the carrier for an explanation and if we are not satisfied by their response then we will re ship your order for you at our own cost. This is expensive for us, and we receive no compensation from anybody, however we do it because we care about about customers and want to ensure you receive your goods as quickly as possible.
We do not offer refunds or any other form of compensation for late deliveries. The information above goes into great detail about how the system works and what customers should expect to see in terms of time frames and data associated with the package. We will of course do whatever we can to help in these cases and do re ship orders where appropriate as per the 20 day policy above.
With that said, we again emphasize that once the package leaves our warehouse it is in the hands of the carriers and have have little to no control over it's progress and ask that customers deploy some understanding into how the global logistics network works and be patient while their orders move through the system.
If you don't have a positive experience for ANY reason, we will do WHATEVER it takes to make sure you are 100% satisfied with your purchase.
Buying items online can be a daunting task, so we want you to realize that there is absolute ZERO risk in buying something and trying it out. If you don't like it, no hard feelings, we'll make it right.
We have staff available 24/7/365 to help with any issues you may have. Call us on 1-844-490-9546 or email us at email@example.com and our team will help.

"Cosmetic procedures are only for rich ladies with too much time on their hands? Tightening skin with exercise? Dr. Valerie Ablaza, a plastic surgeon from New Jersey, has heard every popular myth in the book. On a recent Baristanet post, Dr. Ablaza talks about some of the most pervasive myths and misconceptions about plastic surgery, and why they have it wrong.
1. Plastic surgery is only for rich women with lots of leisure time.
In fact, plastic surgery is used by women (and men!) of all ages, ethnicities, and tax brackets. Dr. Ablaza cites a statistic that indicates “60 percent of the people having cosmetic medical procedures come from households with a combined income of just $30,000-$90,000.”
2. Eyelid lifts create a surprisedappearance.
Eyelid surgery (also known as blepharoplasty) cannot create a surprised look, since the eyebrows are unaffected by the procedure. During a brow lift, however, the eyebrows can sometimes appear too high. This is a temporary effect that soon passes, since plastic surgeons usually have to account for tissue relaxation during the recovery period.
3. Breast lifts change the size of the breast.
Breast lift surgery works by changing the shape and positioning of the breasts. As a result:
- breasts are elevated
- nipples may be repositioned
- skin is tightened
While breast lift surgery does not increase the size of the breast, the procedure is sometimes performed alongside a breast augmentation.
4. Fat removed with liposuction will reappear elsewhere.
Human beings are born with a fixed number of fat cells that enlarge with weight gain and shrink with weight loss. Liposuction permanently removes some fatty tissue. The production of new fat cells is a rare occurrence. As a result, weight gain after liposuction causes the enlargement of other pre-existing fat cells.
5. Exercise after weight loss or pregnancy can tighten your skin.
Skin cannot be tightened to any noticeable extent by exercise. While there are creams, lotions, and skin surface treatments that can make the skin appear smoother, the only way to tighten skin that has been stretched by weight gain or pregnancy is to remove excess skin with body contouring surgery.",<urn:uuid:4ddf2418-abd1-412d-ad6b-18b78e6349db>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://andreaboolian.com/blog-post/5-common-plastic-surgery-myths/,2024-02-20T22:11:32Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.962651252746582,470,1.8816355466842651,2

"Celebrating the American eagle
In honor of Independence Day we begin with a discussion about how the bald eagle became part of the Great Seal of the United States, and how its extinction was averted. Bald eagle populations are now strong. Then, Lori continues with more fascinating facts about both bald and golden eagles.
The American bald eagle in our culture has held an important position in our culture for more than 230 years and continues to do so. It is native to most American states, with the exception of Hawaii, another reason for its symbolic status.
After the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams, with the task of creating an official seal for the new nation.
Is xylitol toxic to dogs?
Peter then reviews the serious risks to dogs when xylitol is ingested. It can cause profound hypoglycemia.
Do you know what xylitol is? Are you (fully) aware of the danger it poses to dogs? You wouldn’t be alone if you answered “no” to either, or even both of these questions.
Yet xylitol can be far-more-dangerous to dogs than chocolate! The picture below shows the minimum amount of dark chocolate that could cause death in three different weights of dog — compared to the minimum number of pieces of xylitol-containing sugar free gum that could have the same devastating effect.
We continue with items about invasive snakes and the humane relocation of snakes, our deep love of dogs, and avoiding pet health emergencies in hot weather activities.
Blue green “algae” alert
This season, there have been reports of dogs becoming sick and dying after exposure to ponds harboring the so-called blue-green algae. Especially frightening is that even clear ponds can sometimes have the blue-green algae growing in them and that exposure can cause rapidly progressive illness and sometimes death. Blue-green algae contain deadly bacteria called cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are microscopic organisms found in freshwater lakes, streams, ponds, and brackish (salty) water ecosystems.
The algae give the water a blue-green or “pea soup” appearance. It looks almost as if someone spilled blue or green paint on the surface of the water. These floating blooms can form thick, dense mats that collect near the shore, which is where animals and people come in contact with them.
Are you an ailurophile?

"Ave Maria – J.S. Bach/Gounod with The Chapel Choir of Pembroke College
‘Ave Maria’, introduced here by one of our Choristers, Imogen Walker.
“This piece started life not as a vocal piece but as an instrumental chamber work: Méditation sur le Premier Prélude de piano de J S Bach. The story goes that Gounod was at his Paris home in 1852 with his fiancée, Anna Zimmermann, and her composer father, Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmermann. Gounod improvised a melody over Bach’s Prelude and was overheard by Pierre who rushed into the room and asked him to play it again so that he could transcribe it. The chamber version was then performed at a house concert a few days later and published in 1853. It wasn’t until 1859 that words were first added; initially a short poem by Alphonse de Lamartine, and later Ave Maria. This is a piece that I used to love singing when I was a child, and I’ve had a soft spot for it ever since.”",<urn:uuid:6f45fb60-0fa1-4660-9d33-8f378abfff1a>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://annalapwood.co.uk/video/anna-lapwood-conducts-ave-maria-j-s-bach-gounod/page/2,2024-02-20T23:33:59Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9738664031028748,242,1.9025630950927734,2

"Last week, we announced the acquisition of POKKT Mobile Ads (POKKT), and this week we start yet another stage of growth for AnyMind Group. I am pleased that we are able to leverage on both companies’ strengths, as we look to grow further, together.
The synergy is immediately apparent on three different levels.
1) Market synergy We have always targeted India and the Middle East for expansion, and POKKT’s bases in these markets allow us to have a local footprint from 17 offices and 13 markets across Southeast Asia, East Asia, India and the Middle East.
What this means is that we are opening up opportunities for our marketers, publishers, influencers, creators and all other stakeholders, from Southeast Asia and East Asia into India and the Middle East, and vice versa – enabling greater expansion and synergy across these markets in the entertainment tech, marketing tech and HR tech spaces.
2) Product synergy POKKT is a leading in-app video ad platform that is integrated with over 1,000 app publishers with a reach of 500,000,000 monthly active users (MAU).
This is something we have started to build up recently, and POKKT provides us with an immediate and strong footprint for mobile advertising.
On the other side, we have built strong offerings for browser-based display and video ads through the AdAsia Premium Marketplace, and all the above are available through the AdAsia Digital Platform and AdAsia360 for advertisers and publishers respectively.
3) Leadership synergy The decision to appoint Rohit as Chief Operating Officer was unanimous between Otohiko, Keizo and I. This shows the extent of trust that we have in Rohit as a business leader and as a person. We are also entrusting Vhaibhav to grow the POKKT offering in our other markets, and also lead India and the Middle East for AnyMind Group.
This allows all of us to play to our strengths, and bring greater growth to the business.
I also want to take this time to highlight the leadership team we have put in place at AnyMind Group. These individuals of different backgrounds have proven their abilities not just as business leaders, but also leaders of people.
I am confident that with this team in place, we can grow further, together.
For marketers and advertisers We want to thank you for your support throughout the years, and we are now in a position to provide you with a strong and integrated solution for your marketing needs.
Combined across all of our markets, we have a direct inventory scale of 1,200 online publishers with a reach of over 117 billion monthly impressions, 1,000 mobile app publishers with a reach of 500 million MAU, and more than 1,800 DOOH signages in Thailand and Japan.
Also, CastingAsia can provide you with access to over 150,000 influencers and influencer data points globally, including a pool of exclusive and non-exclusive talents across Asia through the CastingAsia Creators Network, Moindy, GROVE and AnyUp.
You can now easily leverage on online marketing and influencer marketing through a one-stop solution.
For publishers There is now an immense opportunity for us to work more together. Previously we focused mostly on browser-based monetization, but we can now offer a ready-made infrastructure for mobile apps.
You will still enjoy the advantages of working with us, including the vast array of monetization opportunities, quality support and local & regional expertise to grow your properties.
What will change though, is the added demand from India and the Middle East regions, looking to reach audiences in Southeast Asia and East Asia.
I am excited for the opportunities moving forward, as we look to build together a strong ecosystem for further growth. The acquisition of POKKT is justification for our continued commitment and growth to our employees, customers, investors, partners and the wider industry.
With the combined synergies of the various brands under AnyMind Group, I am confident that we will continue to provide even more value, innovation and growth for the various ecosystems we’re in.
Let’s grow together.",<urn:uuid:93ec655a-2272-40b4-baa8-776fd0f5e7ee>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://anymindgroup.com/th/news/announcement/5150/,2024-02-20T22:44:25Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.948253870010376,849,0.7815080881118774,1

"Trees are a beautiful addition to our landscapes and provide environmental benefits. However, they can threaten our homes and safety if not properly maintained. Tree-related emergencies can result in property damage, personal injuries, and even loss of life. To prevent such incidents, homeowners can take preventative steps to help guarantee their trees’ health and stability.
Regular Tree Inspections
Hire certified arborists to inspect your trees thoroughly at least once a year. Regular tree inspections are crucial for identifying potential risks and ensuring the overall health of your trees. An arborist can assess the structural integrity of the trees, identify signs of decay or disease, and recommend appropriate actions. Early detection of issues can help prevent tree failures and mitigate potential emergencies.
Pruning and Trimming
Pruning and trimming are essential maintenance practices that reduce the risk of falling branches and promote tree health. Regularly remove dead branches to prevent them from falling unexpectedly. Trim branches too close to your house, power lines, or other structures. Proper pruning techniques, such as crown raising or thinning, can improve tree structure and reduce wind resistance, making trees less likely to topple during storms.
Tree Support Systems
Installing tree support systems can help prevent emergencies for trees with weak or compromised structures. Cables and braces can support weak branches or multiple trunks, reducing the risk of failure. However, it is crucial to consult with an arborist who can determine the appropriate type and placement of support systems for your trees.
Healthy tree roots require a well-drained soil that provides adequate nutrients and oxygen. To promote healthy root growth, homeowners should take care of their soil. Avoid excessive compaction around the base of trees as compacted soil can hinder root development. Mulching around the base of trees helps retain moisture and regulate soil temperature. However, not piling mulch against the trunk is important as it can promote disease and insect infestations.
Watering and Fertilizing
Proper watering and fertilizing practices are vital for maintaining tree health and preventing emergencies. Water your trees to encourage deep root growth. Avoid overwatering as it can lead to shallow root systems and make trees more susceptible to wind damage. Consult with an arborist or local extension service to determine the specific watering needs of the tree species in your area. Fertilize trees according to their requirements to ensure they receive adequate nutrients for optimal growth and strength.
Storms can be a significant threat to the stability of trees. Homeowners should take proactive measures to prepare their trees for severe weather conditions. Inspect your trees before storm season, looking for signs of weakness or damage. Remove dead or weak branches that strong winds could break. Consider pruning back branches that overhang your house or utility lines. If a storm is approaching, secure any outdoor furniture or structures that could become projectiles in high winds.
Preventing tree-related emergencies requires proactive measures and regular maintenance. Storm preparedness is crucial to minimize potential damage during severe weather events. Homeowners can protect their homes and property from tree-related emergencies by following these proactive measures.

"- After updating to AirBeam 2.0 i get the message 'Unknown device type cannot be displayed'?
Unfortunately there is a small bug and this may happen if your device name contains special characters. Bug will be fixed asap, meanwhile a workaround is to remove special characters from device name. Device name can be changed in device settings app > General > About > Name.
- How can I watch my AirBeam cameras from anywhere in the Internet?
AirBeam’s autodiscovery mechanism only works when all your devices are in the same local WiFi network. If you want to connect to your camera at home from anywhere in the Internet (or from a cellular network), you first need to configure a port forwarding in your home WiFi router. Otherwise the router’s integrated firewall will block all incoming connections from the outside world.
There are two ways to configure port forwarding:- Since AirBeam for iOS 1.4, the app can automatically configure port forwarding with your router. Prerequisite is that your router supports and has enabled Universal Plug and Play (UPNP) or Apple’s NAT-Port Mapping Protocol. In this case just switch on „Port Mapping“ in AirBeam’s general settings page. If successful, a small cloud icon on AirBeam’s camera view will indicate that the camera is reachable in the Internet and you will see the public addresses by touching the icon. Just use a browser or AirBeam’s „manual connect“ button to connect to these addresses from anywhere. As the public IP address of your WiFi router might change from time to time (depending on your Internet Service Provider), it is recommended to use a free dynamic DNS service like http://www.no-ip.com to be able to access your camera with a constant hostname.
- If your router does not support automatic port forwarding via UPNP or NAT-PMP, you can establish the required port mapping manually with your router’s configuration tool. A step by step example how to set it up can be found here.
- My camera does not appear automatically on the monitor device - what to do?
AirBeam’s autodiscovery mechanism relies on Apples bonjour technology, which requires camera and monitor devices to be connected to the same local WiFi network. Bonjour is supported by nearly all WiFi access points but might be disabled on public or company WiFi networks. If you experience problems, please try the following checklist first:
- Restart your WiFi router – we had quite some case where this solved the problem.
- Ensure devices have basic connectivity (e.g. by checking a web page in Safari).
- Try to connect the devices manually. To do so start the camera on one device and look up the IP address of the camera on AirBeam’s settings page. On the other device, hit the manual connect button in the lower right corner of the monitor tab. Enter the IP address of the camera you looked up before.
- If manually connect also doesn’t work, try to access AirBeam’s build in the web server by entering the URL displayed on the recordings tab into Safari on another device (e.g. from your Mac).
- If all this doesn’t help, try to check on another WiFi network. You can also contact us via our support page and please also let us know the exact WiFi router (brand, model) you are using.
- Can I also use a camera device connected via a cellular mobile network (instead of WiFi)?
Unfortunately this is not possible today as cellular mobile data networks don’t allow incoming connections towards a camera device.
- Video playback isn't smooth when I have enabled Bluetooth on my device?
iPhones, iPods and iPads use a single build in antenna for WiFi and Bluetooth communication. Activating Bluetooth can interfere with and degrade the performance of your WiFi connection. So you might want to disable Bluetooth when using AirBeam.
- Is there a way to turn off the screen completely on the camera device?
Unfortunately the device can’t be locked completely while video capturing continues in the background. The available Apple APIs simply don’t permit this. However, since AirBeam for iOS 1.4, you can enable a „lock screen“ in AirBeam’s general settings. If enabled, the screen will turn dark after 30 seconds in camera mode and will come back as soon as you touch the screen. If you’ve set a password in addition, the app will show a simulate a lock screen similar to the official iOS lock screen. You will have to enter the password you’ve set to get back into the app.
- Where are AirBeam's recordings stored?
By default AirBeam stores all recordings locally on the camera device – even when they are started from a remote monitor. If you use the OSX version, all recordings are stored in folder called „AirBeam“ in your Movies folder.
- How can I integrate the AirBeam video stream with 3rd party surveillance applications?
The app offers a standard Motion-JPEG video stream that can be integrate into many 3rd party surveillance solution like Synology Surveillance Station, Security Spy, etc. The web server delivering this stream listens on the standard web port (80 for iOS, 8124 for OSX) and responds to the URL-Path „/service/camera/video.mjpeg“. For older versions of AirBeam (1.x) the URL-Path is just „/video“.
You can test this easily by entering the URL http://your-device-ip/service/camera/video.mjpeg into a MJPEG compatible web browser (e.g. Safari or Chrome). To add a AirBeam camera to a 3rd party surveillance tool, just enter the device address and „/service/camera/video.mjpeg“ URL in the corresponding settings. The picture below shows the settings dialogue of a Synology Surveillance Station as an example:
- How ca i watch the AirBeam video stream with VLC ?
AirBeam offers a standard Motion-JPEG stream that can be watched with VLC. To do so open a network stream in VLC with the URL: http://your-device-ip/service/camera/video.mjpeg. If you are using AirBeam for OSX, connect to port 8124: http://your-device-ip:8124/service/camera/video.mjpeg",<urn:uuid:a4dee691-b8d8-45c3-a006-4bf39794d50a>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://appologics.com/airbeam/airbeam-faq-2,2024-02-20T21:44:42Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.8732792139053345,1377,1.3229215145111084,1

"Delta Zones Buy/Sell Pressure Indicator
The ""Delta Zones Buy/Sell Pressure"" indicator, created by the original author ""scarf"", is a technical tool that unveils key areas of buying and selling pressure in the market. This indicator utilizes the concept of Delta, calculating differences between open, close, high, and low prices. When these differences exceed a threshold determined by the user-defined standard deviation, areas of intense buying (indicated by green boxes) and selling pressure (indicated by red boxes) on the chart are identified.
How It Works:
The indicator calculates Delta using various combinations of candle prices to determine buying and selling pressure. When Delta surpasses a certain level, indicated by the user-defined standard deviation, visual signals in the form of boxes on the chart are generated. These boxes highlight specific areas where buying or selling pressure is particularly strong, aiding traders in identifying potential entry and exit points in the market.
How to Use:
* When a green box is drawn, it indicates strong buying pressure in the market. This can be interpreted as a signal to consider long positions.
* When a red box is drawn, it indicates strong selling pressure in the market. This can be interpreted as a signal to consider short positions.
* Use these signals in combination with your own analysis and risk management strategies to make informed trading decisions.
What makes this indicator original is its unique approach to identifying specific areas of buying and selling pressure. By calculating Delta in multiple ways and utilizing standard deviation as a filter, this indicator provides clear and concise visual signals about market activity. The combination of these features distinguishes it as a valuable tool for traders seeking a better understanding of market behavior. This modification differs from the original by displaying the information on the price chart with horizontal bars, below each delta, instead of an oscillator at the bottom similar to the volume indicator.
Consider Market Trends:
Before making any trading decisions using the Delta Zones Buy/Sell Pressure Indicator, it is crucial to analyze the prevailing market trends. Assess the overall direction of the market, whether it's trending upward, downward, or moving sideways. Align your trades with the dominant trend to increase the probability of successful outcomes. The indicator's signals can be more reliable when they align with the broader market trend.
Evaluate Macro-Economic Factors:
Additionally, take into account macro-economic factors that could influence price movements. Factors such as economic indicators, geopolitical events, interest rate decisions, and global market sentiments can significantly impact the financial markets. Stay updated with relevant news and economic reports to anticipate potential market shifts. Understanding the broader economic context can help you interpret the indicator's signals within a more informed framework.
Practice Risk Management:
Regardless of the signals provided by the Delta Zones Buy/Sell Pressure Indicator, always implement effective risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio, and only risking a small percentage of your trading capital on each trade. By managing your risk, you can protect your investments and ensure longevity in the market, even during volatile periods.
Continuous Learning and Adaptation:
Financial markets are dynamic and constantly evolving. Continuously educate yourself about new trading strategies, technical analysis tools, and economic developments. Stay open to adapting your trading approach based on changing market conditions. Regularly reviewing your trading strategy and adjusting it according to your experiences and market feedback can significantly enhance your trading performance over the long term.
Seek Professional Advice if Necessary:
If you are uncertain about specific market trends, indicators, or economic factors, don't hesitate to seek guidance from financial advisors or professionals. Their expertise can provide valuable insights and help you make well-informed decisions, especially in complex or uncertain market environments.
By incorporating these recommendations into your trading approach, you can enhance your decision-making process, mitigate risks, and increase your overall chances of successful trading outcomes. Remember, the key to successful trading lies not only in the tools you use but also in your ability to interpret them within the broader market context.",<urn:uuid:e2f330ba-f9b0-44bc-a938-2ac263b3f394>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://ar.tradingview.com/script/xtgICP1l/,2024-02-20T23:24:41Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9153509736061096,830,1.8707424402236938,2

- Affiliate marketers can assist in boosting your products through mobile marketing, social media marketing, online marketing, email marketing, video marketing, advertising, and optimization, which can lead to traffic and sales.
- Moreover, with an affiliate program, you can take your company to the next level while increasing your profits over time.
Affiliate marketing is making money (in the form of commissions) each time you market a business’s services or products and then drive a sale. You only are paid each time you make a sale. This is similar to how a commission-only sales representative earns their money. However, here, a virtual assistant will be promoting the services or products and, for each sale, receive a small commission.
Affiliate marketing is a sort of performance-based marketing in which a company rewards one or more affiliates for every customer or visitor brought by the affiliate’s marketing efforts. The affiliated industry has four core players, namely, the merchant (aka the ‘retailer’ or ‘brand’), the network (which contains offers for the affiliate to select from and also takes care of the payments), the publisher (which is also known as ‘the affiliate’), and also the customer.
Different affiliate marketing techniques can be effective. However, some are more effective than others. Here are some of the best effective affiliate marketing techniques:
- Use different affiliate programs. Don’t rely just on one affiliate program. Use several programs to diversify your income stream. This will also help you to reach a larger audience.
- Promote products that are relevant to your market niche. Don’t promote or market just any service or product.
There are several ways to measure and track your affiliate marketing results. The critical thing is to set up a system that works for your business and you. One way to track your results is to use a software program or set up a spreadsheet that lets you follow your conversions and sales. This will give you a good sense of how much profit you generate from your affiliate marketing efforts.
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. This is because the best tips for affiliate marketing success will vary depending on the niche market and specific affiliate program. But, some general tips can assist in boosting your chances of success as an affiliate marketer. So, do your research. Before marketing any affiliate program, take the time to research the business, the services or products it offers, and the commission structure.
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the critical strategies for affiliate marketing success will differ depending on the services and products being promoted, the target audience, the affiliate network, and the affiliate marketing program. Yet, there are some general strategies that all affiliate marketers should keep in mind to achieve success. So, choose the right products or services to promote.
There is no one answer to this question because everyone makes different mistakes and has different ways of avoiding them. Yet, here are some essential tips that may assist:
- Please pay attention to your actions and their consequences. If you find yourself making many mistakes, take some time to reflect on why this may be happening and what you can do differently.
- Being honest with yourself and acknowledging your mistakes is the first step to avoiding them in the future.
Virtual assistant and affiliate marketing are two different concepts in digital technology and marketing. A virtual assistant is an individual who provides administrative or other types of support to businesses or individuals from a remote location. They may perform tasks such as managing email, scheduling appointments, and handling customer inquiries.
On the other hand, affiliate marketing is a marketing strategy in which an individual or company promotes the products or services of another company and receives a commission for any resulting sales or leads. The affiliate marketer may use various techniques to promote the products or services, such as social media, email, or content marketing.
Affiliate marketing and brand ambassadorship are two strategies businesses use to promote their services and products. Also, affiliate marketing involves promoting a product or service and receiving a commission for any resulting sales or leads. The focus is on driving sales and generating revenue. On the other hand, a brand ambassador promotes a company’s brand and values, often through social media, in-person events, or other marketing initiatives. The emphasis is on building brand awareness and establishing a positive brand image. While both approaches can be practical, their objectives and methods differ significantly.",<urn:uuid:9a0a29f0-cee1-4289-bf98-8e08000ee194>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://aristosourcing.com/affiliate-marketing-virtual-assistant/,2024-02-20T22:28:50Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9495388865470886,1287,1.1331732273101807,1

"Engineers or doctors don’t see the value of social media. For many, these sites are merely fluff. However, social media helps brands become noticed − they are a great way to connect with their clients and build trust. If you are an engineer with a great new product, you want a matching social media presence. A virtual assistant social media manager can help you get there.
What to expect from a virtual assistant social media manager
A social media manager or remote social media assistant is utilized by many small startups that want to keep their business overheads low while scaling rapidly.
These companies want to attract venture capitalists to invest in their business. Many startups like to outsource their non-core tasks. This idea is something they have found on Google, which is known for outsourcing their non-core tasks.
Social media management is one of these non-core tasks. It is an essential yet much-overlooked task. Much occurs behind the scenes that are geared to gain the best results for every post released − the graphics, the copy, the timing, using influencers, and scheduling the posts.
A virtual social media assistant can manage these social media campaigns with ease. Moreover, the assistant will relieve busy executives of undue time spent on their social media channels.
This is valuable time that can be spent on their core work.
Some of the tasks of a virtual assistant social media manager
Managing different social media accounts: As part of managing various social media accounts, the virtual social media assistant would reply to comments and queries (predominantly negative comments).
However, they will also post engaging and fresh content, share others’ content, and schedule posts.
Pinpointing and interacting with your core target audience
You need to think big if you are a small startup with big dreams. It would help if you built your social media status quickly.
You do so by posting great content, engaging with the audience, and devising novel social media campaigns that draw the interest of potential new clients.
So, let a virtual assistant make these channels work for you!
Scheduling and calendar management
Planning is everything (well, not really, but it helps to be organized). A good social media calendar will provide explicit and informative content that can be released regularly.
Your business will appear active 24/7 and always available to help clients.
Here, a remote assistant will use software such as Hootsuite or others to schedule the posts so they go live on the correct date and at the right time.
Follow-up and marketing
Social media works well for startups that can’t post LinkedIn ads. Social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter can be sources of leads for the sales team.
The sales team can connect with new leads via email marketing to intensify their story. The social media assistant will ‘warm the client up’ and bring them to the point where they feel they know and trust your brand.
However, this warm-up process is not instant – it can take a few months to materialize.
The benefits of hiring a social media virtual assistant
When companies start hiring, they typically limit their outreach to the city or town where they are located.
This works for on-site employees. Virtual assistants are not on-site employees.
Instead, virtual assistants such as social media virtual assistants or social media VAs are committed to a company but work remotely.
This means that a company can hire great talent for less and remain competitive. A virtual assistant is a game-changer for many businesses that can’t afford such highly qualified people locally.
Instead of lowering their expectations, these startups can onboard some of the best talent available – albeit from abroad.
Virtual assistants are a cost-effective staffing solution
Outsourcing means hiring people from elsewhere to accomplish your business tasks.
Typically, they do not command the fees on-site employees demand. Nor do you have to pay benefits or taxes for them.
This savings can be up to 70% on business overheads, especially if you add the savings on office supplies, a workstation, and office space.
How to Hire Your Virtual Assistant for Social Media
If you are ready to boost your social media, there are specific steps you should consider.
Write down the tasks you would like to delegate and who the person would need to keep updated.
We suggest speaking to an outsourcing expert if this is the first time you will hire a virtual assistant. Also, identify which channels you want to create and build your market dominance.

"In this week's edition of the NBA Power Rankings the Miami Heat take the top spot despite some injuries woes. The New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers still can't crack the top ten and there is a huge surprise at number 2. Let's take a look...
1. Miami Heat 8-1: LeBron James has been the best player in the NBA and the Heat continue to cruise along even with Dwayne Wade sidelined with a foot injury. The Heat are 3-0 without Wade and even beat the Hawks in triple OT without him and James.
2. Philadelphia 76ers 6-2: This is based on how teams are currently playing. Do I think the 76ers are going to end up as the second best team in the NBA this season? No, but right now they have the highest point differential, best offensive efficiency and defensive efficiency. The 76ers are also in the midst of a five game winning streak, which is the longest in the league.
3. Chicago Bulls 8-2: Bulls have the third highest point differential in the NBA. In a good sign for Chicago, Carlos Boozer is starting to pick up his play. If he could get back to the level he produced in Utah it would really help the Bulls offensively.
4. Oklahoma City Thunder 8-2: I like that the Thunder are 3-1 on the road early in the season. Teams who are going to be number one seeds in their conference need to win on the road. They are winning without Russell Westbrook playing good basketball. Losing Eric Maynor for the season was a hit and rookie point guard Reggie Jackson is going to need to step up.
5. Portland Trailblazers 6-2: I really like this Portland team and I am interested to see how this season plays out for them. I never thought LaMarcus Aldridge would become as good as he currently is.
6. Atlanta Hawks 7-3: The Hawks have impressive wins over the Heat and Bulls plus they would have beat the Bulls a second time if they could have made free throws down the stretch. After a slow start Josh Smith is playing terrific basketball.
7. San Antonio Spurs 6-3: The Spurs are 6-0 at home and 0-3 on the road. They are just trying to keep things together until Manu Ginobili returns. I like this Spurs team more than last year's team because of the depth they have on the bench.
8. Los Angeles Clippers 4-2: The Clippers have only played six games, the least of any team in the NBA. The offensive is tremendous, but they are still trying to figure things out defensively.
10. Orlando Magic 6-3: Orlando's best win is against the Houston Rockets and they were blown out by the best two teams they faced - the Bulls and Thunder. Dwight Howard is playing tremendously as he waits to get traded.",<urn:uuid:294428a4-1a51-4514-8889-ff3b21ecac11>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://arizona.sbnation.com/phoenix-suns/2012/1/10/2696177/nba-power-rankings-top-10-2012,2024-02-20T23:32:41Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9777474403381348,587,0.830527126789093,1
"Written by Gavin Ramsay
A number of Armagh astronomers travelled this week to the University of Warwick in England to take part in the first `in-person’ UK National Astronomy Meeting since 2019. Over 800 people participated either in person or remotely. For many PhD students it was the first big meeting they had been to. From Armagh, Erin, Chris, Kerem, Gautham, Rok and Nived all gave presentations either in-person or remotely.
The five days of the meeting were split into ‘plenary’ sessions which were open to all and a series of ‘parallel’ meetings which were more specialist. Lunch time sessions were devoted to topics such as Diversity in Astronomy, Sci-Art and Careers. Evening events included the keenly anticipated Football tournament (I believe the team from QUB won!) and a trip to Kenilworth Castle.
The initial results from JWST were amongst the plenary sessions. Some of the images were very impressive, as was the technological achievement of bringing such a hugely difficult project to a successful start. However, my view is that it is the spectra from star forming regions; galaxies (both near and far) and exoplanets, which will provide the real scientific interest.
George Efstathiou from Cambridge asked, ‘Do We Have a Standard Model of Cosmology?’ The answer was … ‘yes’ … ‘but’ … we don’t understand inflation, dark matter or dark energy. Moreover, is the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model just a fitting function (and not telling us anything)? In George’s view, there hasn’t been a paradigm shift for 40 years since the development of inflation which predicts the universe rapidly expanded in very earliest fraction of a second after the big bang. His ‘best bet’ would be the detection or discovering the nature of dark matter.
Other talks which stood out (at least for me) was Richard Horne from British Antarctic Survey who outlined the effects of Space Weather on satellites. In the 1980’s many high-profile satellites failed and insurers found it difficult to assess risk. They started giving contracts to Solar and Plasma Physicists to help. He noted that many low earth satellites (starlink etc) have been launched in recent years during Solar minimum and will be interesting to see how they survive during the approaching Solar maximum. Finally, it was great to see work from the Gravitational Wave community which is generating more complex waveforms which are needed to better model the data expected from the next Ligo/Virgo observation runs starting the Spring of next year.
Finally, but perhaps most importantly, it was great to see many friends and colleagues in the `real world’ for the first time since before the pandemic. I’ve seen many on Zoom every week, some several times a week, and saw at least one new colleague for the first time in person. However, the biggest shock was to remember how tall many of them were … either that or I’m getting even smaller … (everyone appears to be the same size on Zoom!). I did hear someone telling a colleague they didn’t recognise them without their usual background ….

"For over 30 years Monash Gallery of Art’s (MGA) benefactors have been instrumental in the development of the only public collection solely dedicated to Australian photography, and it all started with a tapestry donated by Harry Seidler…
Since its inception MGA has forged its own trailblazing path, never wavering from its commitment to champion and support Australian photography and its artists. MGA has long been praised for being progressive and innovative, especially when in the early 1980s it took the bold, unfashionable and revolutionary step to focus on Australian photography.
In doing so, MGA became the only public collection solely dedicated to Australian photography and soon came to hold one of the nation’s most significant collections of Australian photographs.
Now numbering over 3,100 Australian photographs, MGA’s collection illustrates the story of photography in Australia and its development is in no small part due to the generosity of donors. Collectors, supporters and artists have been critical to the collection’s development with half the collection built through donations.
Curated by Anouska Phizacklea, LEGACY. Your Collection. Our Story. celebrates the impact benefactors have had on the development of one of the nation’s most unique and important collections, a collection dedicated to Australian photography and its artists.
LEGACY teases out the fascinating and compelling stories behind the works, and showcases significant works that chart the history of MGA, from a Joseph Albers tapestry donated by Harry Seidler, the architect of MGA’s building, through to the most recent donated works by Australian luminaries including Carol Jerrems, Max Dupain, Wolfgang Sievers just to name a few.

"Welcome to the resource topic for 2021/1583
Orientations and the supersingular endomorphism ring problem
Authors: Benjamin Wesolowski
Abstract:We study two important families of problems in isogeny-based cryptography and how they relate to each other: computing the endomorphism ring of supersingular elliptic curves, and inverting the action of class groups on oriented supersingular curves. We prove that these two families of problems are closely related through polynomial-time reductions, assuming the generalised Riemann hypothesis. We identify two classes of essentially equivalent problems. The first class corresponds to the problem of computing the endomorphism ring of oriented curves. The security of a large family of cryptosystems (such as CSIDH) reduces to (and sometimes from) this class, for which there are heuristic quantum algorithms running in subexponential time. The second class corresponds to computing the endomorphism ring of orientable curves. The security of essentially all isogeny-based cryptosystems reduces to (and sometimes from) this second class, for which the best known algorithms are still exponential. Some of our reductions not only generalise, but also strengthen previously known results. For instance, it was known that in the particular case of curves defined over \mathbb F_p, the security of CSIDH reduces to the endomorphism ring problem in subexponential time. Our reductions imply that the security of CSIDH is actually equivalent to the endomorphism ring problem, under polynomial time reductions (circumventing arguments that proved such reductions unlikely).

"I’m often shocked at the ways in which many people in their 20s, 30s and 40s carelessly share personal information about themselves in very public ways.
We’ve all heard of people over-sharing on Facebook and Twitter, doing things like telling other when they’re away from their home or exactly when and where they’re traveling, or posting pictures of their new flat-screen in their apartment.
All of these are ill-advised practices that make it easy for crooks to potentially target you for theft.
Unfortunately, some older Americans – namely retirees and pre-retirees – are equally guilty of carelessly exposing their personal information.
But these days, senior citizens (and all of us), really do have to do a better job of guarding our personal identities.
That’s why I was so alarmed last night, as I was watching the Democratic National Convention, to see an older woman flash her Medicare card on national television.
Former President Bill Clinton was on stage was talking about Medicare, when all of a sudden the camera panned to a woman boldly (and foolishly) holding up her own Medicare card in plain sight.
Needless to say, the card had sensitive and private information, including her name, social security number and date of birth.
To put that information out there so publicly is like giving a well-known thief the front keys to your door and saying: “I’m going out for a few hours. Feel free to take what you want.”
I recognize that this woman probably acted impetuously, and on an impulse, simply whipping her card out to show that she was a Medicare recipient, and that she didn’t want anyone messing with her Medicare benefits.
But honestly, that’s still no excuse. You should think before you act in this electronic age, especially when something you do can be seen and broadcast all over the world in an instant.
Frankly, I also blame the camera man and PBS. I know this was a live event. But they shouldn’t have taken that shot. Or if the camera man wasn’t aware of what was being seen, someone in the control booth should’ve exercised better judgment and quickly panned away from that shot, or not allowed it to air in the first place.
As I said to my husband, what would they have done if that same woman had lifted her shirt and exposed her bare chest? Would they have taken video of the woman’s breast and shown the woman to the entire country and the world?
I don’t mean to be graphic. But to me, the logic is pretty much the same.
If you see something, even as a photographer/videographer or producer, and you realize that it clearly isn’t appropriate for the circumstances or puts someone at risk, at what point do you have a responsibility to NOT air that material?
But back to the woman herself. I do think the ultimate blame lies with her. She simply made a poor choice. Again, it was likely a careless, spur-of-the-moment thing. Nevertheless, it’s when we’re in the heat of the moment that we all need to keep cool heads.
Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time – in fact, it’s far from it – when I’ve seen an elderly person do something risky and unwise in the fast-moving electronic age.
I once wrote an online article about debt and a retiree actually posted a comment online replying to my article. In that person’s comments, he asked me for help in dealing with a debt problem and he went on to give me his social security number and home phone number. I was stunned by this extreme naivete on his part.
I did reply to the man’s request for help. And when I reached out to the man, I also told him not to post his private information in a public forum again.
When you divulge private information (willfully or unwittingly), so much can go wrong:
An identity thief can steal your social security number and file a bogus tax return.
A crook can open credit card accounts in your name.
A scammer can try to loot your banking, investment or financial accounts.
And if you’re the victim of identity theft, you lose more than money. You also lose your good credit. And you waste precious time trying to clean up the mess left by the identity thief.
So let’s all be a lot more careful, and much more guarded, when it comes to our personal data and private information.",<urn:uuid:f71548ee-d2d3-4114-9fac-fd7146339c02>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://askthemoneycoach.com/protect-your-identity-ssn-and-sensitive-documents/,2024-02-20T21:30:28Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9731401205062866,973,1.4494634866714478,1

"JORABAT, March 3 - With the State government planning to set up an integrated solid waste management facility (ISWMF) for the Guwahati Capital Region, a team of officials from the district administration and Guwahati Municipal Corporation (GMC) today visited one of the sites identified for the project near Jorabat ahead of preparation of the detailed project report (DPR).
It has been learnt that a 27-bigha plot covered by dag number 32 in Tamulikuchi NC under Sonapur mouza has been identified for the facility.
However, the proposed site, located behind the Goat Research Station (GRS) at Byrnihat, was not found suitable for construction of the ISWMF, following which, the administration has now proposed to swap the land with the GRS, to set up the facility along the highway.
It may be mentioned that the Goat Research Station has been running since 1973. Interestingly, it is the only goat research station in Assam and the North East, located at 13th Mile near Jorabat, under the Directorate of Research (vety) of the Assam Agricultural University. It has helped transform the living standards of people involved in goat farming through various schemes and programmes.

"Webinar - How to plan and implement single-case designs. Part 2: ensuring scientific rigour (Student)DescriptionAvailable to purchase for Students.
This 60-minute webinar was presented by Prof Robyn Tate on 29th May 2020.
Synopsis: This practical “how-to” webinar builds on information presented in Part 1 of this series. It assumes the delegate has knowledge of basic concepts pertinent to single-case design (SCD) methodology, the common types of designs, a procedure to implement an SCD, and a framework for using single-case methods in clinical practice.
This webinar focuses on how to ensure an SCD is scientifically sound. It first addresses threats to internal validity and how they apply to SCDs. It then describes Standards of Design as published by the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC). The third section presents the internal validity subscale of the Risk of Bias in the N-of-1 Trials Scale and shows how it can be used in the planning stage of a study to maximize scientific rigour and minimize threats to internal validity. Finally, the webinar concludes with a description of WWC Standards of Evidence for establishing evidence-based treatments.
Webinar outcomes: at the end of this webinar, delegates will have knowledge of 1. common threats to internal validity as encountered in SCDs; 2. the four WWC Design Standards for SCDs; 3. the seven internal validity items of the Risk of Bias in N-of-1 Trials Scale and how they can be used to minimize threats to internal validity; and 4. WWC Standards of Evidence.

"Are you aware that by simply making a few minor yet meaningful changes to your eating habits, you can live a longer life and enhance your health?
Maintaining good eating habits is crucial for optimum health and will increase your energy levels, help you lose weight, enhance your mood and much more. Plus, it’s extremely easy to get started with healthy eating. Keep reading for five good habits that will allow you to start eating healthier today.
Habit 1 – Don’t Skip Breakfast
People often skip breakfast because they’re in a rush during the morning and have to dash out of the door. However, there’s a reason breakfast is considered the most important meal of the day. A healthy and well-balanced breakfast will give you plenty of energy to carry out your daily tasks with relative ease and also remain in good spirits throughout the day. In addition, studies show that people who have a healthy breakfast actually lose more weight than individuals who have no breakfast because they are less likely to get tempted by unhealthy treats during the day. We’ve all had a vending machine “meal” before. How often are they healthy? Not often. Plus, a healthy breakfast supplies your body with all the nutrients it needs after an extended period of fasting during sleep. So if you’re constantly skipping breakfast, make time for it every day and enjoy all the benefits it provides.
Habit 2 – Plan Your Weekly Grocery Shopping
If you fail to plan your weekly grocery shopping, it’s more than likely that you’ll run out of healthy foods before the week is over. Then when there’s nothing healthy to eat at home, you will order junk food or fill up on unhealthy foods that are loaded with calories. Therefore, if you are keen on achieving good eating habits, schedule in some time every week to plan and shop for healthy foods that will cover all of your meals for the full seven days.
Habit 3 – Keep Healthy Snacks On Hand
Healthy snacks are a fantastic tool that can keep you satiated between meals and stop you filling up on unhealthy processed treats. There are lots of quick and easy healthy snacks you can choose from with fresh fruits, Greek yogurt, nuts, smoothies and seeds all being excellent options. So choose some healthy snacks that you like and make sure you always have them close by for the times when hunger strikes.
Habit 4 – Drink Plenty Of Water
Drinking at least eight glasses of water per day has a number of health benefits. First, it stops you filling up on unhealthy sodas or other calorie laden beverages. Second, it keeps you fully hydrated which ensures your body performs optimally, increases your metabolism, boosts your energy levels, enhances your circulation and much more.
If you’re struggling to consume eight glasses of water per day, you can boost your intake with other healthy hydration options. Coffee, fruit infused water, tea are all great alternatives to water that contain zero calories, are completely natural and very hydrating.
Habit 5 – Mix Up Your Diet
Regardless of how healthy your diet is, you’ll quickly get bored with it if it consists of the same foods day in and day out. This in turn will cause you to deviate to unhealthy foods. To avoid this trap, make sure you mix up your diet and include a variety of healthy and tasty meals. When you do this, you’ll start to enjoy the process of healthy eating much more because every meal tastes different and offers you fresh new flavors. As a result, you’ll rarely be tempted by junk foods and find maintaining your healthy eating habits a lot easier.
These five habits may sound simple but they’re highly effective.

As part of the panel session at the 12th Annual Investment Meeting (AIM) held by AIM Foundation on May 10, Hu stressed the critical role of a cloud-based unified app ecosystem in modernizing digital public services and driving the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)’s Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).
From our partners:
During the session, titled Future Cities: Tapping into New Technologies and Navigating Transformational Technologies of the Future, he called attention to developing a strong, thriving digital ecosystem being a key to sustaining smart cities. Hu also said that cloud technologies has been, and will continue to be, fundamental and essential to the digital transformation journey, especially for businesses and governments that look to improve service efficiency and drive better engagement amongst customers and residents.
“Tencent Cloud is positioned to serve as the partner of choice for smart city transformation in the GCC. Seamless access to online citizen-centric public services is possible via an ecosystem platform, where apps, websites, online services and offerings can be integrated and operated under to offer a holistic service experience.”
Gulf states are increasingly focused on modernizing their public services as a means to realize their national visions. A robust digital infrastructure is fundamental to achieving economic diversification, sustainable development, and foreign direct investment (FDI).
Tencent Cloud possesses more than two decades of ecosystem-building experience in the consumer internet space, supporting the largest communication and social application in China, Weixin/WeChat, serving over 1.3 billion monthly active users.
“Backed by our cloud capabilities and proven track records in digitalizing public services, we are well-positioned to meet the evolving needs of the public and businesses in the Gulf states,” Hu added.
Tencent Cloud recognizes the need of digital transformation and has made the GCC a priority market as it expands internationally. The TMF drives the expansion of Tencent Cloud offerings in the region, offering an efficient, full-cycle support and management solution for mobile application ecosystem development with a wide range of applications from public service applications to gaming, e-sports, financial services and telecommunications.
For example, Tencent Cloud joined hands with Guangdong’s Digital Government to bolster the province’s transition to e-governance. The company’s digital solutions had helped build a “Digital Guangdong Series” platform, featuring more than 1,800 livelihood services and functions for its citizens to access on a single digital platform. Hu shared that the initiative had improved the quality and efficiency of online government service capabilities for citizens in Guangdong.
With a vision to become one of the world’s most advanced digital governments, the UAE is at the forefront of digital transformation. The UAE Digital Government Strategy 2025 aims to create a seamless and integrated user experience that is accessible to all citizens and residents, regardless of their location or physical abilities. This ambition underpins the need for robust and secure cloud capabilities that can enable access to public services through a singular digital gateway.
In addition, Tencent’s local approach and strategic partnerships are aligned with the needs of the GCC governments to provide seamless and convenient public services. Tencent Cloud works with regional enterprise partners, namely Mobily, to optimize the operator’s IT architecture and assist Mobily in providing secure, stable, and flexible cloud solutions and services with an app integrated under one roof. Similarly, Tencent’s cloud services can be tailored to support enterprises, businesses and governments in building their digital ecosystem platform.
Today, Tencent Cloud provides more than 400 technologies and connectivity solutions that support enterprise-grade digital transformation through its global infrastructure network, covering more than 26 geographic areas across five continents and 70 availability zones, with more than 2800 acceleration nodes.

A true workhorse of a video camera!
Comments:For many years, low light level CCD monochrome surveillance video cameras have been the standard workhorse for astronomers doing video occultation timing and video meteor recording. The 902 series of cameras from Watec (Japan) and Watec America have long been the leaders and innovators in getting the emerging Sony CCD technologies out to the market. The 902 series was far ahead of most other manufactures in that it used Sony CCD's in 1/2"" format.
The WAT-902B is the current version of the 902 series camera from Watec (Japan) using the Sony Super HAD technology CCD detector. It is virtually the same camera as the earlier WAT-902 and the WAT-902A and has just a slightly better sensitivity rating of .003 lux at f/1.4. The primary changes over the years have been in the Sony CCD technology and slight changes to the camera external connections.
I have used the WAT-902B on several occasions and found its performance to be virtually identical to the earlier models, though I have not owned one myself. It would routinely go down to 8th magnitude or better on smaller sized amateur telescopes using a good composite monitor.
I highly recommend it if you require a camera at this sensitivity level.Sort by",<urn:uuid:602d7a25-78da-4198-a75b-d6250831dab4>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://astronomyconnect.com/items/watec-wat-902b,2024-02-20T22:39:05Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9254254698753357,289,1.9565082788467407,2

"This is a politically desperate distraction which hints that the Democrats aren’t as confident about former Vice President Joe Biden’s supposedly impending victory as their media surrogates are trying to convince everyone is bound to happen in a few weeks’ time.
US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi recently said that she’ll seek to promulgate a bill mandating the formation of a Congressional commission tasked with deciding whether the 25th amendment should be applied to US President Donald Trump. That amendment creates a mechanism for removing the President from office if they’re unable to continue their duty. It’s been previously discussed before considering Trump’s erratic behavior, but this time Pelosi says that it’s relevant in regards to his supposed lack of recovery from COVID-19.
This is a politically desperate distraction which hints that the Democrats aren’t as confident about former Vice President Joe Biden’s supposedly impending victory as their media surrogates are trying to convince everyone is bound to happen in a few weeks’ time. Instead of focusing on the issues that matter to most Americans, chiefly socio-economic ones, the most powerful elected Democrat in the country right now decided that it’s better to once again speculate about whether Trump is mentally fit to continue serving as President.
There are several reasons why she decided to go this route. Firstly, the series of scandals that the Democrats tried to trap Trump in have thus far failed to remove him from office. These are “Russiagate”, “Ukrainegate” (for which he was officially impeached by the House of Representatives), and what can be described as the first variation of “COVIDgate”, which pertains to his administration’s alleged cover-up of when it learned just how dangerous this virus is and the government’s seemingly irresponsible response to it afterwards.
This second variation of “COVIDgate” is less credible than the first since it can be interpreted as little more than a personal attack against Trump. Not only that, but it also risks stigmatizing other COVID-19 victims and survivors. As it stands, the international medical community doesn’t know much about the long-term consequences of COVID-19. There isn’t any consensus concerning Pelosi’s innuendo that certain treatments make patients mentally unfit to continue their professional activities.
Her malicious speculation might also be motivated by the party’s desire to cover up for their presidential and vice presidential candidates’ less than stellar performances at the recent debates. Although reviews of these events are mixed, it can objectively be said that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence had impressive showings and made some pretty valid points against their opponents. Pelosi seems desperate to distract from any further discussion about those debates, hence another reason why she’s now pushing the 25th amendment bill.
There’s a near-universal expectation among experts that her efforts are bound to fail. It’s unrealistic to expect the bill to pass, let alone a majority of Cabinet members and the Vice President to agree that Trump is unable to remain in office. She’s therefore doing this for purely political purposes, which makes a mockery out of that amendment, risks stigmatizing COVID-19 patients and survivors all across the world, and raises uncomfortable questions about just how confident the Democrats really are about Biden’s possible victory.
Americans have long had enough of political theater over the past four years since the 2016 presidential campaign catalyzed the descent of domestic politics into madness. They deserve better from both parties considering what’s at stake in this election. The Democrats cannot convincingly claim that Trump’s tweets are a tactic to distract from domestic issues when Pelosi is pushing her 25th amendment bill for that exact same purpose. Both the Republicans and Democrats are guilty of emotionally manipulating the American people.
Many argue that this election is the Democrats’ to lose after taking into account Trump’s low approval ratings and the multitude of scandals that have accompanied his time in office. That’s a provocative, yet nevertheless largely accurate, assessment, which makes it all the more disappointing (though not necessarily surprising) to see Pelosi resort to her latest scheme. The Democrats have the chance to show Americans that they’re everything that Trump isn’t, yet here they are applying similar tactics in order to distract voters, which is a pity.",<urn:uuid:e14dbc55-4e53-4462-8ed2-6b79d1d8eb57>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://astutenews.com/2020/10/speaker-pelosis-25th-amendment-push-is-a-politically-desperate-distraction/,2024-02-20T23:32:35Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9718633890151978,908,1.3728586435317993,1
"Understanding Dual Citizenship
Dual citizenship, also known as dual nationality, is a legal status in which a person is a citizen of two countries at the same time. This status can be acquired through various means, such as birth, marriage, or naturalization. Each country has its own set of regulations regarding dual citizenship, and Poland is no exception. Navigating the process of obtaining dual citizenship in Poland can be complex, but with the right information and guidance, it is achievable.
Polish Citizenship by Descent
One of the most common ways to obtain Polish dual citizenship is through descent. If you have a parent, grandparent, or, in some cases, great-grandparent who was a Polish citizen, you may be eligible to claim Polish citizenship. The process typically involves gathering documentation to prove your lineage and submitting an application to the Polish government. While the specific requirements may vary depending on individual circumstances, having a thorough understanding of your family history and the relevant regulations is crucial.
Applying for Citizenship by Naturalization
If you do not qualify for Polish citizenship by descent, another option is to apply for naturalization. This process involves meeting certain residency and language requirements, as well as demonstrating a commitment to the Polish community. While the details can vary, the general process includes submitting an application, providing supporting documentation, and possibly attending an interview. It’s important to familiarize yourself with the specific criteria and procedures to ensure a smooth application process.
Benefits of Dual Citizenship
Obtaining dual citizenship in Poland can offer a range of benefits, including the ability to live, work, and study in Poland without the need for a visa or residence permit. Additionally, dual citizens have the right to own property in Poland and access the country’s healthcare and social services. Furthermore, having Polish citizenship opens up opportunities to travel and reside in other European Union countries. Understanding the advantages of dual citizenship can help motivate individuals to pursue this status.
Navigating the Legal and Bureaucratic Landscape
As with any legal process, navigating the complexities of dual citizenship regulations in Poland can be challenging. From understanding the relevant laws to gathering the necessary documentation and filling out the required forms, the process can be daunting. Seeking guidance from a legal professional or immigration specialist with expertise in Polish citizenship matters can be invaluable. They can provide personalized advice and support to ensure that you are on the right track throughout the application process.
Moreover, connecting with other individuals who have successfully obtained dual citizenship in Poland can provide valuable insights and firsthand experiences. Online forums, social media groups, and local communities can be excellent resources for networking and learning from others who have gone through the process.

"Understanding the Importance of Regulatory Bodies
Regulatory bodies are essential in the online gambling industry as they help to prevent fraud and protect the interests of both the players and the operators. These organizations work to ensure that online gambling sites operate within the legal and ethical boundaries, providing a fair and secure environment for all involved.
Implementing Stringent Regulations
One of the key roles of regulatory bodies is to implement stringent regulations that govern the operations of online gambling platforms. These regulations cover aspects such as fair play, responsible gambling, and anti-fraud measures. By enforcing these regulations, regulatory bodies help to maintain the integrity of the online gambling industry and protect players from potential fraudulent activities.

By working together, these entities can identify potential vulnerabilities and implement effective measures to mitigate risks and prevent fraudulent activities within the online gambling space.
Utilizing Advanced Technologies
As technology continues to evolve, regulatory bodies are leveraging advanced tools and solutions to combat online gambling fraud. This includes the use of sophisticated data analytics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. By embracing these innovative technologies, regulatory bodies can stay ahead of potential threats and safeguard the integrity of online gambling operations.
Educating and Empowering Players
Another important aspect of the role of regulatory bodies in preventing online gambling fraud is educating and empowering players. Regulatory bodies often provide resources and information to help players understand the risks associated with online gambling and how to protect themselves from fraudulent activities. By promoting responsible gambling and providing access to support services, regulatory bodies can help players make informed decisions and avoid falling victim to fraud.
In conclusion, regulatory bodies play a crucial role in preventing online gambling fraud by implementing stringent regulations, collaborating with industry stakeholders, leveraging advanced technologies, and educating and empowering players.

"The Olympic and Paralympic Trials presented by Bell won’t look like any other Trials before. With no fans, an altered program, and a smaller roster of athletes competing, this annual event will be different.
With so many obstacles and restrictions involved to keep everyone safe, one thing guided the long journey to make the Trials happen.
It’s all about the athletes.
Hear from athletes, coaches, and high-performance leaders about how there is just something special about a National Championship and an Olympic and Paralympic Trials.
While there will be no spectators June 25 to 27 at Claude Robillard Sports Complex in Montreal, Athletics Canada’s high performance leadership team will be watching closely. With the Games approaching quickly, they will be looking for one thing: performance on demand.
“You want to see resilience in an athlete’s performance at Trials,” said Athletics Canada’s Head Coach Glenroy Gilbert. “Even if it doesn’t present the same way we’re used to, with the fans and the overlay of the track, this is similar to what we may encounter when we get to Tokyo. We’re always looking for athletes to perform on demand, which calls for you to be at your very best at your Olympic Trials.”
“What we’re trying to get all the athletes to do is perform on-demand,” echoed Simon Nathan, Athletics Canada’s High Performance Director. “As part of that process, there’s also a huge amount of pride in being National Champion. Regardless of circumstances, only a small number of people ever get to be a National Champion in their event.”

"If you are a travel enthusiast and looking to experience something unique, doing an Interrail through Europe might just be what you need. This type of travel has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason: it is an affordable and exciting way to explore different countries and cultures in Europe.
You can tailor your trip to your interests and preferences. If you love nature, you can choose to visit the stunning landscapes of Norway or the beautiful lakes of Austria. If you are a history and culture enthusiast, you can opt to visit cities such
as Athens, Budapest, or Prague. And if you are looking for party and fun, do not miss out on the famous nightclubs of Berlin or the vibrant nightlife of Barcelona.
But, even though planning an interrail trip can be an exciting experience, it is also overwhelming if you are not sure where to start. Here are some more details about how to plan an Interrail trip to make the process easier:
1. Choose your route: The first step in planning an Interrail trip is to decide where you want to go. You can start by making a list of the countries and cities you want to visit. Consider the time of year, your budget, and your travel preferences when choosing your route.
2. Decide on your ticket: Once you know your route, you can decide on the type of Interrail ticket you need. You can find the best interrail ticket for you,from a Global Pass, One Country Pass, or Flexi Pass. A Global Pass allows you to travel to 33 countries, while a One Country Pass is perfect if you want to explore a single country in-depth. Flexi Passes offer a flexible way to travel, allowing you to choose your travel days within a set time frame.
3. Plan your itinerary: After you have your route and ticket, it's time to plan your itinerary. Research the different trains and schedules, so you can avoid missing out on any must-see destinations. Some popular routes include traveling from Amsterdam to Berlin, visiting Paris, Rome, and Barcelona, or exploring in Eastern Europe by starting in Budapest and ending in Krakow. These are some of the Top Cities to Visit in Europe When Interrailing.
4. Book your accommodation.
5. Budget wisely: Interrail is a cost-effective way to travel around Europe, but it's important to budget wisely.
6. Research the culture and customs you'll be visiting. This will help you understand and appreciate the local customs and avoid any cultural misunderstandings.
7. Pack wisely: When packing for your
Interrail trip, consider the weather, your itinerary, and the type of accommodation you'll be staying in. Pack light, but make sure to bring essentials like a comfortable pair of shoes, a travel adapter, and a lock for your luggage. Also, the travel leather money belt is always a good idea when traveling, keeping your valuables safe and secure while exploring the continent by train.
8. Be flexible: While it's important to have a plan, it's also essential to be flexible. Interrail offers a lot of flexibility, so take advantage of it. If you come across an unexpected opportunity, don't be afraid to change your plans.
By following these steps and planning your Interrail trip carefully, you can ensure that you have an unforgettable experience exploring Europe by train.",<urn:uuid:c89d74e2-cb8d-4e0d-9b69-c235e9c2084c>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://atitlanleather.com/blogs/life-and-leather-lovers/discovering-europe-by-rail-an-interrail-adventure-1,2024-02-20T22:30:49Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9287954568862915,693,1.437562108039856,1

"‘I honour healthy boundaries, I know what is right for me, and I consider others’
The Aries full moon is upon us. The moon conjunct Chiron is opposite the sun in Libra.
A bit of an uncomfortable see-saw between solid direction and indecisiveness. Between the warrior and the lover.
I’m going to leave you the amazing words of Evelyn this full moon, I’ve been run down and suuuper tired, so honoring my boundaries.
But I will leave you with a note I wrote for myself.
If you have been feeling overwhelmed, use this full moon to find your strength. We all have inner strength we didn’t even know was there. Get up, keep going.
All of the tools you’ve learned over the years, now is the time to implement them. Don’t crumble under the weight of this momentous year of change. The hard parts always make the purest of diamonds.
If you have been feeling angry and battered like a fighter, take some time to yourself and find the beauty in life again. Spend quality time with loved ones. Self care and nourishment, come back into the heart. Recognise the love in you, in others too.
While Mars in Aries is squaring Saturn and Pluto we can see and feel restrictions around fighting for our truth and what is right. It’s no doubt an intense time, and it can take its toll on us squishy ones.
So go gentle, find grace and up the self care. Reassess healthy boundaries, know what is right and not right for you and balance that with considering others.
Happy full moon!
Kerry - Magic of I.
Full Moon in Aries 9° 08”
""Teacher Gives New Symbolic Forms to Traditional Images”
When we actively confront people with a full heart, we lead not with judgement but with compassion and a desire for a harmonious outcome. The Sun entered Libra on September 22nd, when the Sun enters either Aries or Libra, the divine masculine and feminine principles of day and night are in equal harmony to one another. We call these Sun entrance points Equinoxes and for the northern hemisphere Libra season signifies the beginning of Autumn while in the southern hemisphere the sign Libra ushers in Spring. Wherever you are on the globe, the equinoxes are important markers of transition and change.
During Libra season we always experience a full moon in Aires which conjures within us themes such as: independence, confrontation, balance between self and other, relationships and duality. The opposition of the Sun and the Moon releases energies from within us that have been buried deep, waiting for the right moment to be let go. The Sun reflects and illuminates its divine white light onto the surface of our Moon blasting the shadows with its pure radiant, solar, life-force. This simple cyclical ebb and flow dance guides us to appreciate the inhale just as much as the exhale, to neither linger nor grasp for one over the other. As we traverse the Sun on our tiny beautiful planet, we understand the key to harmony is balance and the key to maintaining grounded footing is to remain equanimous through both the light and the dark parts of life.
Ma’at is the Egyptian goddess deity that is a personification of truth, justice, wisdom, law, harmony and the seasons. She is the goddess that all souls meet after their departure from the material plane. Before the soul can transcend up into the cosmic ethers and re-unify with the great source, it must be judged by Ma’at *. The way Ma’at is able to tell if a soul is worthy of transcendence, she weighs it with her ostrich feather. Ma’at was born from Ra (The Sun) and Hathor (The Moon), she is the goddess of the equinoxes and is present in many celebrations of balance and harmony. Her connection to Libra is uncanny, she uses the scales of justice to weigh the heart, the scale is the only inanimate object in the zodiac and is the symbol for Libra. Ma’at represented the daily law and practices that the citizens of Egypt were expected to follow in their everyday life and Libra’s ruler Venus, the Roman goddess of justice is the deity that we all unknowingly follow as the ruler of the justice systems in government courts. Hence why you will often see depictions of owls, a woman with a sword, scales or blindfolded on court room seals. These symbols are reused throughout the world in various ways and stems from our relationship to the cosmos but more specifically, the relationship between the Sun and the Moon.
“Training is the first part of the Warrior’s path, and thus the Warrior’s Moon. Fighting effectively is more than just running into the battle in blind wrath. The first demons that need to be subdued are the ones inside, and this is the lesson that the Warrior must learn before he can pick up a sword.” – Raven Kaldera
Full Moon in Aries is named “The Warrior’s Moon” By Astrologer and Northern Pagan Shaman, Raven Kaldera in his book Moon Phase Astrology, and this Full Moon in Aries is definitely going to bring the warrior from within us out into the foreground. Full Moons and quarter moons are when energy becomes manifest, which is why we see a lot more action, change and movement during these moon phases. The warrior from within is here to lead the way into what appears to be a confrontation with the other. If we understand alchemy at all however, we come to find that the ‘other’ we are fighting against is that which has been latent inside us, materialized through our perceptions of the outside world. Treat the other how you would treat your inner self. We see power struggles within relationships, groups of people and ideologies where a dormant well of unspoken boundaries were kept hidden. It’s easy to forget that when we don’t overtly express a boundary with another that there is room for misinterpretation of these unspoken boundaries. Telling someone how to respect you is not rude, it is an act of kindness towards yourself and them. Everyone has a different definition of what respect means to them, you have to convey that openly, plainly and direct or else there is room for miscommunication.
The Aries Full Moon this year makes contact with Chiron, so the emotionality of this Moon is heightened and can feel like a stinging thorn in the side of the ego. It hurts to share how we feel, and it can bring us pain to have to create these walls between ourselves and those who do not respect our needs. 1 day after the Full Moon the Moon meets up with Mars in Aries, set yourself up for success now by writing down all the ways you have felt disrespected, unfairly treated, talked down to and make amends with it. Promise yourself from this point moving forward, that your friends, family and your bosses will know what your threshold is, so they are made aware whether or not they are encroaching on your emotional space. This is what the Full Moon in Aries is opening up for us, opportunities to confront old relationship wounds in order to move forward and heal where we have let ourselves down by not sticking up for our values, beliefs, space, territory, friends, what have you!
Mercury turns Rx in Scorpio two weeks after the Full Moon in Aries, expect a well spring of hidden information to pour forth. Maybe you yourself have some secrets that you have been bursting at the seams to share. Whatever has been hidden will be revealed, the winged messenger moves through the netherworld sign Scorpio to dredge up past secrets and that which has been swept under the rug. If there is something you have been wanting to tell a friend or loved one that has just been eating you alive, now is the time to go on with it.
Mercury is moving deep into the subconscious mind, purging what we have forgotten from years ago. This time of release should leave you with a lot less weight on your shoulders and a lot more room in your heart. The lightness from expelling our inner demons is a liberating act and one that the lord of karma, Saturn aids us with. Sometimes you have to cut to the chase, swift and sharp can be the least painful.
Mars retrograde is making his way into a square with Pluto, the planet of the underworld and will meet this caretaker of ghosts just in time for Samhain celebrations. October 8/9th – 12/13th the two sync up and boy do the energies feel intense, one day after their meeting Mars makes an opposition with the Sun. The two masculine forces are battling it out for dominion over the territories. Heightened aggression and polarity are hard to miss. We may find that we become easily triggered by societal issues and polarizing political banter, “we can’t just sit around any longer” a message we hear loud and clear. Mars is the planet of brute force, the military, sexual drive and how we exert our force onto the world around us. On the personal level, this can be a time when the path of least resistance is the most productive and we may feel like we want to fight and act out, but that energy will only be turned around onto ourselves. The time for action is when Mars turns direct, it can feel like most of what we try to fight for is blocked in various ways so notice if the universe is telling you a big “NO”. But what we do find during this deep transit is the key information that we need in order to win the battle. Use the information wisely and take action with timed precision, otherwise excess energy can be wasted. Remember the lessons you learned during the Full Moon in Aries and the themes of Libra, remain strong, convicted and equanimous.
Our lady Venus in Virgo remains in beautiful aspect to Mars, Lilith and the Moon throughout these heavy transits and offers us strength through grace. She moves out of Leo and into Virgo the day after the Full Moon, shifting the scales of justice towards service for those in need. We see more organized mobility around offering aid, food and services to the sick. Compassion for service industry folks and the nurses and doctors who have been taking care of our wellness all while risking/ sacrificing theirs. The issues around healthcare and wellness culminate when Venus makes an opposition to Neptune on October 17th / 18th just after the new Moon in Libra. Venus’s harmonious aspect to Lilith makes way for cunning and slick communication from the feminine point of view. She makes it hard to look away as she pierces the veil of false light. We see strong female leaders standing out and hitting directly where the weak spots are. There is a very confident and independent nature that comes out of feminine performances. How we as a society express love, sex and self-expression is praised as a liberating and progressive feat. We find creative solutions that can wow a crowd. On a personal level this will feel like a liberating time, of course with all of these heavy aspects forcing us to purge out what has been hidden, there is no question that the lightness of being outweighs the heaviness of conformity.

"Adelaide residents have rallied together to rescue a ""scared"" dog cowering between the wheels of a train as it sought refuge after being hit by car.
On Saturday afternoon a local animal rescue organisation jumped into action after hearing a German Shepherd pup had been hit by a car and was ""covered in blood"" in the northeast suburb of Salisbury.
Despite volunteers and members of the public attempting to the catch the dog, they were unsuccessful before a train began to travel down the track towards the nine-month-old dog. Thankfully, it worked in their favour.
""The train came along really slow. It was slowing down as it approached the train station and then all of a sudden the dog ran underneath it,"" Christine Robertson told Yahoo News Australia.
The Director of Lost Pets South Australia explained the dog was trying to hide from her volunteers who aimed to catch it, and were only able to reach the injured dog after crawling underneath the train with help from the ""magnificent"" train driver.
German Shepherd now in safe hands
It was initially believed the dog had sustained a spinal injury and broken jaw due to its poor mobility and blood-covered state, but upon medical examination the pup only had a few lacerations and abrasions on his paws.
""He was very lucky,"" Christine said, who shared that despite the dog being ""a bit of a love bug"" once he had calmed down, no owner has reached out to claim him. Without a microchip either, there is no way for the animal rescuers to reunite the pet with his family.
It is a legal requirement for all dog owners to microchip their pets in South Australia, and the animal rescue organisation is hosting the ""biggest microchipping program in southern hemisphere"", Christine said. She said there is ""no excuse"" for the dog not to be microchipped.
The dog, now affectively nicknamed 'Chugga' in reference to the recognisable sounds made by a train, is being cared for by staff at a specialist animal hospital while awaiting word from his owners.
Praise for local community
Salisbury Council praised the local community for coming together and finding an efficient solution amid the chaos on Saturday.
""All the accolades go to the community who rescued the dog from the train before our officer could be onsite,"" the council spokesperson told Yahoo, after confirming their Compliance Community Officer only took 30 minutes to arrive on the scene once they were notified.
Christine, who was awarded the 2023 South Australian of the Year — Local Hero Award, said she is proud to lead the 60 volunteers who work tirelessly to care for and reunite lost pets with their owners.
“Huge tick for my team — they literally put the call out and within a matter of minutes there were volunteers jumping in cars with leashes,"" she said, before adding, ""Big credit to the team for doing that"".
""The more people that understand that the work we do is significant enough to get an Australian of the Year Award, the more help we get from councils and government to keep our programs going"", she said.

"Feel the rhythm pulsating through your veins, igniting a dance of anticipation in your feet. From the heart of Africa emerges a musical phenomenon that has taken the world by storm, captivating minds and bodies alike. But what is Afrobeat music? Unravel the magic as we embark on a vibrant journey into the soul of this genre, delving into its origins, grooving to its infectious beats.
Afrobeat is a genre of music that originated in West Africa, primarily in Nigeria, during the late 1960s and 1970s. It is a fusion of various musical styles, combining elements of traditional Nigerian and West African rhythms with jazz, funk, highlife, and soul music. The genre was pioneered by Nigerian musician and political activist Fela Kuti.
Key characteristics of Afrobeat music include complex rhythms, prominent horn sections, repetitive groove patterns, and socially conscious lyrics. The music typically features extended instrumental passages and vocal chants, creating a hypnotic and danceable sound.
Lyrically, Afrobeat songs often address socio-political issues, corruption, inequality, and injustice. Fela Kuti, in particular, used his music as a platform to criticize the Nigerian government and advocate for human rights and social change.
What is the definition of Afrobeat music?
Afrobeat is a music genre that originated in West Africa in the late 1960s and early 1970s, particularly in Nigeria. It was developed by Nigerian musician and political activist Fela Kuti, who is often referred to as the “Father of Afrobeat.” Afrobeat is a fusion of various musical styles, combining traditional West African rhythms and melodies with jazz, funk, and soul influences.
Key features of Afrobeat music include:
- Complex Rhythms: Afrobeat is characterized by intricate polyrhythms, typically involving a combination of percussion instruments, drums, and other traditional African instruments.
- Horn Sections: The genre often includes a prominent horn section, which plays tight and rhythmic horn arrangements to add depth and energy to the music.
- Political and Social Themes: Afrobeat’s lyrics frequently address social and political issues, reflecting Fela Kuti’s own activism and desire to use music as a means of spreading awareness and promoting social change.
- Extended Instrumental Jams: Songs in Afrobeat tend to have extended instrumental sections that allow musicians to showcase their skills and create a lively and dynamic atmosphere during performances.
- Call-and-Response Vocals: Afrobeat songs often feature call-and-response vocals between the lead singer and backup vocalists or the audience, creating a sense of community and participation.
Over the years, Afrobeat has evolved and influenced various contemporary music styles, becoming a global phenomenon and inspiring artists worldwide.
Who is considered the pioneer of Afrobeat?
Fela Kuti is widely considered to be the pioneer of Afrobeat. He was a Nigerian musician, bandleader, composer, political activist, and Pan-Africanist. He developed Afrobeat in the late 1960s by fusing traditional Yoruba music and highlife with American funk, jazz, and soul influences.
Afrobeat is characterized by its complex polyrhythms, chanted vocals, and socially conscious lyrics.
Kuti’s music was highly political and often critical of the Nigerian government. He was a vocal opponent of military rule and corruption, and his concerts were often met with violence from the authorities. Despite this, Kuti remained a popular figure in Nigeria and his music had a significant impact on the development of African music.
Kuti’s influence can be heard in the work of many other Afrobeat artists, including his sons Femi and Seun Kuti, as well as younger artists like Wizkid, Davido, and Burna Boy. Afrobeat has also become popular in other parts of the world, and it is now considered to be one of the most important genres of African music.
Here are some other notable pioneers of Afrobeat:
- Tony Allen, drummer and co-founder of Fela Kuti’s band Africa 70
- Ginger Baker, British drummer who played with Fela Kuti in the 1970s
- King Sunny Ade, Nigerian singer and songwriter who blended Afrobeat with traditional Yoruba music
- Keziah Jones, British singer and songwriter who fused Afrobeat with reggae and funk
- Femi Kuti, son of Fela Kuti and a leading exponent of Afrobeat today
How does Afrobeat fuse African rhythms and jazz?
Afrobeat is a genre of music that originated in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria, during the late 1960s and 1970s. It was pioneered by the legendary Nigerian musician Fela Kuti. Afrobeat is characterized by its fusion of African rhythms and jazz elements, creating a unique and influential sound that has had a significant impact on the global music scene.
Here’s how Afrobeat fuses African rhythms and jazz:
- African Rhythms: At its core, Afrobeat draws heavily from traditional West African music, particularly Nigerian highlife, Yoruba, and Afro-Cuban rhythms. These rhythms are often driven by complex polyrhythms, syncopation, and a strong emphasis on percussion instruments, such as drums, congas, and shekeres. These elements create a pulsating and infectious groove that is central to Afrobeat’s appeal.
- Jazz Influence: Fela Kuti, the founder of Afrobeat, was heavily influenced by jazz music, which he discovered during his studies in London. He was particularly inspired by the works of American jazz musicians like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Duke Ellington. Fela integrated elements of jazz into Afrobeat, such as extended instrumental solos, horn arrangements, and sophisticated harmonies. The horn section, including saxophones and trumpets, often plays a crucial role in Afrobeat bands, adding a rich and dynamic texture to the music.
- Extended Song Structures: Afrobeat songs are typically much longer than traditional pop or rock songs, often exceeding 10 minutes and sometimes going beyond 20 minutes in length. This extended format allows for extensive improvisation, a characteristic commonly associated with jazz music. Musicians in Afrobeat bands have the freedom to take extended solos, showcasing their technical abilities and creativity.
- Social and Political Themes: Another commonality between Afrobeat and jazz is their focus on addressing social and political issues through their music. Fela Kuti used his platform to criticize the Nigerian government, advocate for human rights, and speak out against corruption and oppression. Like jazz musicians, he used his music as a form of protest and activism, giving Afrobeat a powerful and socially conscious dimension.
What are the typical themes explored in Afrobeat music?
Afrobeat music often explores themes of social justice, political activism, and Pan-Africanism. Fela Kuti, the genre’s pioneer, was a vocal critic of the Nigerian government and his music often addressed issues such as corruption, poverty, and environmental degradation. Other common themes in Afrobeat music include love, loss, and spirituality.
Here are some specific examples of themes explored in Afrobeat music:
- Social justice: Afrobeat music has a long history of addressing social justice issues. Fela Kuti’s songs often criticized the Nigerian government and called for social change. Other Afrobeat artists, such as Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti, have continued this tradition, using their music to raise awareness of important issues such as poverty, corruption, and environmental degradation.
- Political activism: Afrobeat music has also been used as a tool for political activism. Fela Kuti was a vocal critic of the Nigerian government and his concerts were often met with violence from the authorities. However, he remained a popular figure in Nigeria and his music helped to raise awareness of political issues. Other Afrobeat artists have also used their music to promote political change.
- Pan-Africanism: Afrobeat music is often associated with the Pan-African movement, which seeks to unite Africans across the continent and diaspora. Fela Kuti was a strong believer in Pan-Africanism and his music often promoted unity among Africans. Other Afrobeat artists have also embraced Pan-Africanism, using their music to celebrate African culture and promote unity.
- Love: Love is another common theme in Afrobeat music. Fela Kuti’s songs often celebrated love and relationships. Other Afrobeat artists have also written songs about love, exploring themes such as heartbreak, loss, and new beginnings.
- Loss: Loss is another important theme in Afrobeat music. Fela Kuti’s songs often dealt with the loss of loved ones, both personal and communal. Other Afrobeat artists have also written songs about loss, exploring themes such as grief, mourning, and resilience.
- Spirituality: Spirituality is another important theme in Afrobeat music. Fela Kuti was a devout Yoruba man and his songs often explored Yoruba religious beliefs. Other Afrobeat artists have also incorporated spirituality into their music, drawing on a variety of religious traditions.
These are just a few of the many themes that are explored in Afrobeat music. The genre is rich and diverse, and its artists often use their music to address important social, political, and spiritual issues.
Which instruments are commonly used in Afrobeat compositions?
Afrobeat compositions typically involve a wide range of instruments, each contributing to the vibrant and infectious sound of the genre. Some of the most commonly used instruments in Afrobeat include:
- Drums: The drum section is fundamental to Afrobeat music, and various types of drums are used to create the intricate polyrhythms that drive the groove. Common drums include:
- Talking Drum: A traditional West African hourglass-shaped drum that can imitate the tones of the Yoruba language and is known for its tunable pitch, allowing it to “talk” and produce different pitches.
- Kit Drum Set: A standard drum set consisting of kick drum, snare drum, toms, and cymbals, adding modern and dynamic elements to the rhythm section.
- Congas and Bongos: Percussion instruments of Cuban origin that contribute to the rhythmic complexity and energy of the music.
- Bass Guitar: The bass guitar provides a deep and steady foundation for the rhythm section, helping to anchor the groove and connect the drums with the melodic instruments.
- Horn Section: The horn section plays a prominent role in Afrobeat compositions. It typically includes saxophones (alto, tenor, and baritone) and trumpets. The horns add vibrant melodies, dynamic arrangements, and powerful solos to the music.
- Keyboards: Electric keyboards, synthesizers, and pianos are used to provide harmonic support, texture, and occasional solo parts. They bring a modern touch to Afrobeat compositions while maintaining the genre’s fusion essence.
- Guitar: The guitar plays various roles in Afrobeat, including providing rhythmic strumming, melodic lines, and occasional solos. It contributes to the overall groove and adds layers to the music.
- Vocals: Afrobeat often features powerful lead vocals and harmonies. The lyrics often touch on social and political themes, and the vocal performances can be expressive and passionate.
- Percussion Instruments: In addition to the main drums, other percussion instruments like shekeres, tambourines, claves, and cowbells are commonly used to add further layers of rhythmic complexity and texture.
- Brass Instruments: In addition to the horn section, other brass instruments like trombones and flugelhorns may be included to enhance the richness of the arrangements.
Overall, the combination of these instruments creates the signature Afrobeat sound, blending traditional African rhythms with jazz, funk, and other modern elements.

- Empowering African culture and identity. Afrobeat is a genre that is rooted in African culture, and its rise to global prominence has helped to empower African culture and identity.

What makes Afrobeat’s grooves danceable and infectious?
Afrobeat’s grooves are known for their danceable and infectious qualities due to several key musical elements and cultural influences. Afrobeat is a genre that originated in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria, during the late 1960s and was popularized by the legendary musician Fela Kuti.
Here are some of the factors that contribute to Afrobeat’s danceable and infectious nature:
- Rhythmic Complexity: Afrobeat is built on intricate and polyrhythmic percussion patterns. Multiple layers of rhythmic elements, such as drums, congas, and shakers, interlock to create a compelling and groovy foundation for the music. The syncopated beats and constant drive provide a captivating energy that makes people want to move.
- Horn Sections: Afrobeat often features a powerful horn section, typically including saxophones, trumpets, and trombones. The horns add an infectious melodic and rhythmic layer to the music, creating catchy hooks and exciting arrangements that encourage dancing.
- Repetitive Grooves: Afrobeat songs often maintain a steady and repetitive groove throughout, allowing dancers to lock into the rhythm easily. The consistent pulse and repetition create a hypnotic effect, making it hard to resist moving to the music.
- Call and Response: Traditional African musical styles frequently employ call and response patterns, where a lead vocalist or instrument calls out a phrase, and the audience or a chorus responds. This interaction enhances the communal and participatory nature of Afrobeat performances, encouraging people to join in and dance together.
- Incorporation of Western Styles: Fela Kuti, one of the pioneers of Afrobeat, blended traditional West African rhythms and melodies with elements of jazz, funk, and soul from Western music. This fusion created a unique and accessible sound that appealed to a wide audience and made the grooves more familiar and dance-friendly to global listeners.
- Social and Political Messaging: Afrobeat often addresses social and political issues in its lyrics. The combination of engaging rhythms and thought-provoking messages can motivate people to dance with a purpose, expressing joy and unity while engaging with important themes.
- Live Performance Energy: Afrobeat is best experienced in a live setting, where the energy of the performers and the audience’s response create an electrifying atmosphere. The infectious grooves, combined with the charisma of the musicians, make it almost impossible for the crowd not to dance along.

How does Afrobeat reflect a pan-African identity?
Afrobeat, as a genre of music, was pioneered by Nigerian musician Fela Kuti in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is characterized by a fusion of various musical styles, including traditional African rhythms, jazz, funk, and highlife, with a strong emphasis on percussion and complex instrumental arrangements.
Afrobeat’s lyrics often address social and political issues, advocating for social justice, African unity, and the end of colonialism and oppression.
The genre of Afrobeat reflects a pan-African identity in several ways:
- Cultural Fusion: Afrobeat is a melting pot of various African and African-influenced musical styles. Fela Kuti drew inspiration from his Yoruba heritage, as well as from other West African musical traditions, blending them with elements of Western music. This fusion of different cultural influences represents the diverse cultural heritage of Africa as a whole.
- Social and Political Themes: Afrobeat’s lyrics are often politically charged, addressing issues that resonate with people across the African continent. Topics like corruption, inequality, and the struggle for liberation and self-determination are common themes in Afrobeat songs. By highlighting these shared concerns, Afrobeat promotes a sense of solidarity among Africans and encourages a collective consciousness.
- Emphasis on African Identity: Afrobeat musicians frequently celebrate African identity and cultural heritage through their music. Fela Kuti, for example, encouraged Africans to embrace their native names and reject European names as a way to affirm their pride in their African heritage. This focus on cultural identity reinforces a sense of unity and shared belonging among Africans.
- International Influence: Afrobeat has transcended national boundaries and gained popularity not only in Africa but also globally. As the genre spread beyond Nigeria, it became a symbol of pan-Africanism, inspiring musicians and activists from various African countries. The international appeal of Afrobeat further strengthens the connection and sense of solidarity among Africans worldwide.
- Advocacy for African Unity: Afrobeat often carries messages of African unity and the need for collective action to address the continent’s challenges.
Fela Kuti, in particular, was a vocal advocate for the unification of African nations and the rejection of neocolonial influences. This call for unity resonates with the pan-African ideals of cooperation and collaboration among African countries.

What role has Nigeria played in the development of Afrobeat?
Nigeria has played a central and pioneering role in the development of Afrobeat.
The genre’s origins can be traced back to the creative genius of Nigerian musician and activist Fela Kuti, who is often referred to as the “Father of Afrobeat.” Several key factors contributed to Nigeria’s crucial role in shaping and popularizing this influential musical style:
- Fela Kuti’s Innovation: Fela Kuti, a multi-instrumentalist and bandleader, was the driving force behind the creation and evolution of Afrobeat. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he combined traditional Nigerian rhythms, Yoruba music, and highlife with elements of Western jazz, funk, and soul. Fela’s innovative approach to music composition and arrangement led to the birth of Afrobeat as a distinct genre.
- Political and Social Relevance: Fela Kuti’s music was deeply rooted in his commitment to social and political activism. His lyrics addressed pressing issues such as government corruption, social inequality, and human rights abuses. By intertwining his music with powerful social messages, Fela gave Afrobeat a unique identity that resonated not only with Nigerians but also with people across the African continent and beyond.
- Cultural Identity: Nigeria’s diverse cultural landscape played a significant role in shaping Afrobeat. The country is home to a wide range of ethnic groups, each with its own rich musical traditions. Fela drew inspiration from this cultural diversity, incorporating elements from various Nigerian cultures into his music. This fusion of cultural influences helped Afrobeat represent Nigeria’s cultural heritage on a global stage.
- Lagos: Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city and commercial hub, served as a vibrant backdrop for the development of Afrobeat. The city’s lively music scene provided a platform for Fela Kuti and his band, Africa 70, to experiment and perform their groundbreaking music. Lagos became a creative hub where Afrobeat evolved and thrived.
- International Impact: Fela Kuti’s international tours and collaborations with Western musicians introduced Afrobeat to global audiences. His performances in Europe and the United States helped Afrobeat gain recognition and acclaim outside of Nigeria, contributing to its integration into Western music culture.
- Influence on Future Generations: Fela Kuti’s impact on Nigerian and African music cannot be overstated. He inspired numerous musicians, activists, and artists in Nigeria and beyond, who continue to build on his legacy and carry the Afrobeat tradition forward.
- Fela’s Enduring Legacy: Even after Fela Kuti’s passing in 1997, his influence continues to shape contemporary African music and global musical trends. His sons, Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti, have followed in their father’s footsteps as talented Afrobeat musicians, ensuring that the genre’s legacy remains vibrant and relevant.

"As the second year of the incessant inventory shortage draws to a close, some new-car shoppers may be feeling far from festive. Reduced new-car incentives and tight inventory can be likened to receiving a lump of coal in place of the excitement that normally accompanies car shopping. Yet despite the challenges, there are several reasons to remain hopeful this season: New-vehicle inventory is finally showing signs of improvement; fewer cars are selling above sticker price; and the foursome of vehicles featured below come bearing gifts in the form of generous cash and financing deals in December.
According to J.D. Power, vehicle production is starting to ramp up after months of pandemic-related disruptions. Available inventory surpassed 1 million units for the second month in a row, while new vehicles are spending more time on dealer lots. Some 49% of new cars were sold within 10 days of arriving at a dealership in November, down from 57% in March. On average, a new vehicle now spends 21 days at the dealership — three days longer than the same time a year previously. Another promising sign is that markups pushing a vehicle’s price above MSRP are beginning to taper off: J.D. Power estimates that around 41% of new vehicles were sold above MSRP in November, down from 50% in July.
Even as inventory improves, however, shoppers shouldn’t expect a miracle since incentives are still hard to come by. The average incentive per vehicle in November was estimated at $1,009, or just 2.2% of MSRP — that’s down 1.3 percentage points compared to the same time in 2021. Meanwhile, interest rates for a new-car loan continue to climb, reaching an estimated 6.37%.
The four highlighted vehicles bring above-average cash incentives and financing deals to infuse some holiday cheer back into the year-end car-shopping experience. While modest discounts can be found on select 2023 models, which we’ve noted, shoppers will find the best incentives when they opt for 2022 variants of the following vehicles:",<urn:uuid:6ddd78bd-68b0-4385-911d-5832ba35d410>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://autofinder.cincinnati.com/articles/whats-the-best-new-car-deal-for-december-2022-459995/,2024-02-20T23:43:52Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9605950713157654,423,0.8875858783721924,1

"Tie knot aficionado and factorback champion Merril Hoge revealed on ESPN today that he’ll be taking some time off to undergo heart surgery. Hoge said he’d miss about a month and joked about trying to beat Ben Roethlisberger back to action. To most of us, that’s quite the scary scenario, but Hoge was talking about it as if it was a minor inconvenience. If there’s one thing about Hoge you can’t question, it’s his toughness – both on the football field and in his past battle with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Here’s the exchange with Trey Wingo and Tim Hasselbeck on ESPN right at the conclusion of NFL Primetime:
I can’t imagine handling that kind of news with that kind of composure. Hoge’s colleague Trey Wingo confirmed the statement on Twitter.

As he mentioned on the air today … Merril is having heart surgery to repair a vessel. The procedure has been planned for several weeks. His health is strong and he has great doctors. He expects to make a full recovery and will be out several weeks.
We wish Merril a speedy recovery and look forward to having him back on our NFL coverage later this fall.

"KPay Helps Merchants Establish Resilient, Reliable Payment Businesses on AWS
KPay Merchant Service Limited (KPay) is a financial technology company that started in Hongkong in 2020. When building its business, KPay needed service stability, geographical availability, and strict compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and other financial industry data security standards. It also needed a cloud provider that can offer a platform with reliable infrastructure and services to support its rapid growth.
Accelerating Growth Securely
By running on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, KPay can benefit from best security practices, get alarms, and fix breaches automatically. The Amazon Security Hub provides KPay with Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) workflow capacities. Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon WAF and Amazon CloudTrail protects KPay’s AWS accounts and business workloads from risks of unauthorized activities and malicious actions, allowing it to defend against web threats. It also relies on AWS’s PCI DSS Level 1 Service Provider certification for industry compliance, while enhancing internal control for the stability and security of each transaction.
Chief Technology Officer of KPay Merchant Service Limited
Diversifying Services for Data-Driven Insights
Finance and payment involve the processing of massive data which contain insights for business development. By building a data warehouse on Amazon RedShift, KPay obtains more data-driven insights for fraud protection, credit extension, business analysis and other scenarios. With these data insights, its merchants could continuously explore innovations beyond their POS collection services.
Reducing System Operation, Maintenance, and Security Patrol Inspection Workloads
KPay uses Amazon Lambda to pre-process business data in a serverless manner, decoupling its system while reducing operation and maintenance workloads. The integration of Amazon CloudFormation and Amazon WAF automatically updates configuration sets and rules, which lets its collection platform defend new web threats more rapidly. Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) allows KPay’s operation and maintenance team (O&M) to create, manage and track encryption keys more easily, reducing the people need for O&M from 6 to 3. The technical team can now focus on innovating its fintech solutions.
Expanding Its Global Presence
Going forward, KPay plans to adopt Amazon Fargate, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and other services to fully containerize its fintech business, and use AWS’s DevOps solutions for a unified and continuous integration and delivery on the cloud. This cloud-native and serverless approach will make KPay’s product R&D, testing and launch more stable and efficient.

"How Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers Barely Held It Together on ‘Echo’
Everything Tom Petty touched turned to platinum during the '90s, starting with the sales carryover from his 1989 solo debut Full Moon Fever and continuing through a series of bestselling releases that included a pair of albums with the Heartbreakers, the solo Wildflowers LP and a greatest-hits record that boasted a couple new hits of its own. When Petty and the Heartbreakers announced an April 13, 1999, release for their 10th studio LP, Echo, expectations were understandably high.
Looking at the liner notes, it seemed reasonable to assume that Echo was destined to become yet another huge hit for Petty and his bandmates. Like Petty's previous release, a soundtrack album for the 1996 Edward Burns movie She's the One, as well as 1994's Wildflowers, the new LP boasted the involvement of producer Rick Rubin, who'd helped give Petty's recent work a slightly rougher, more no-nonsense sound while working to maintain the focus on songwriting that had made the band such reliable hitmakers.
But if the personnel was basically the same, it was evident that Echo presented a different Petty. Clustering together 15 songs that weighed in at more than an hour in length, the album announced itself with ""Room at the Top,"" a five-minute lament of lost love that begins on a starkly defiant note before closing with the gut-wrenching plea ""Please love me, I'm not so bad / And I love you so."" In between, there's a howling middle section in which Mike Campbell's guitar is unleashed over a stomping Steve Ferrone beat — but through it all, Petty sounds broken, resigned, defeated.
Like ""Room at the Top"" — a song Petty once sarcastically described as ""one of the most depressing songs in rock history"" — Echo is a record that rocks in its way, but is permeated by the same stark sonic palette reflected by its somber black-and-white cover photo. It comes across, in a way, like an echo of the sound — and the band — fans had come to expect.
There were some very good real-life reasons for this. ""I had some long periods of severe depression,"" Petty told USA Today. ""I took some hard knocks and retreated from the world and lived in this little cabin. I didn't see a lot of people. I wasn't happy, and I didn't want to lay that on everybody. Even when I was in public, I didn't want to be there, and that's a terrible feeling. It took me a while to want to come back.""
Watch Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' 'Room at the Top' Video
Even the biggest rock stars have contractual obligations to worry about, however, and Petty's pulled him back into active duty before he was really ready to face the prospect of making a new album.
""I think Echo was probably the most scattered I’ve ever been,"" he told Dean Goodman. ""I never played it. I looked at the cover the other day and there was a song or two I didn’t recognize, I don’t even remember writing. It was a very hard time when I did that record. It was the only record I did kinda under the gun in my life where there was this huge tour booked and I had to finish the record.""
The hard time, as fans were aware, stemmed from Petty's divorce. ""Divorces are really furious things to go through, really draining,"" he explained. ""So to try to make a record and get my life together at the same time was really rough.""
It all added up to what Petty called ""a very dark record"" — and one he didn't have the strength to support once it was out in stores. ""I didn’t do anything to promote it. I didn’t do any promotion. I didn’t make a video. I didn’t do nothing. I think that probably played into it. Plus,"" he conceded, ""I don’t know how good it is.""
Many artists are their own worst critics, and while Echo may not be a great album by Petty's estimation, even the worst Tom Petty record is better than many other artists' best. Tt still represented a bit of a tumble from the lofty heights he'd enjoyed with releases such as Into the Great Wide Open and Wildflowers, but reviews were generally kind and the album sold respectably, peaking at No. 10 while going gold and sending three singles (""Free Girl Now,"" ""Swingin'"" and ""Room at the Top"") into the Top 20 at Mainstream Rock radio.
Watch Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' 'Swingin"" Video
Ultimately, Petty himself found a way to love an album that represented a painful snapshot from a dark personal period. ""I think that my life was such a circus at that time, that I don’t think I felt like I was there half of the time,"" he told Paul Zollo in Conversations With Tom Petty. ""I know Rick doesn’t feel like I was there half of the time. But I was.""
After some prompting from his second wife, he finally listened to the album, and was surprised by what he heard. ""I thought for the longest time that I didn’t like it. And later Dana and I were in the car, and [Echo] came on the CD-changer, and I said, ‘Oh no,’ and she said, ‘Listen to this. Really listen to it.’ And we were driving somewhere that was a fairly long drive, and I listened to it, and I really, really liked it,"" he admitted.
""I went, ‘Damn, you know, this ain’t that bad, is it?’ For some reason, I got in my head that I didn’t like it. But I really did like it that day when I heard it in my car.""
Still, even if was eventually able to appreciate it, Petty still sounded an ambivalent note regarding Echo, and not just because some of the songs stemmed from the end of his marriage. The Heartbreakers themselves were on the verge of saying goodbye to one of their own — bassist Howie Epstein, who would succumb to years of addiction struggles in 2003, shortly after being fired from the band.
""There was a lot going on then in my life. Howie was disintegrating before our eyes. That was a big issue. Not the happiest time for the Heartbreakers,"" Petty told Zollo. ""We did a tour behind that record. We did a pretty long tour, for us. That’s what I remember most about it, doing the tour. And the tour went on and on and on. And we played quite a few songs from it. But I was kind of glad to get to another place after Echo. I was kind of glad to get somewhere else. I don’t know why, but I kind of felt like we came back into the sun after that.""

"THE B8 OF HOPE FAMILY
In 2016, an inspiring tale unfolded in Geneva, as a close-knit circle of eight friends, hailing from diverse origins including Swiss, Canadian, Indian, Iranian, Israeli, and Palestinian backgrounds, embarked on a remarkable journey. This group represented a spectrum of faiths, including Jewish, Christian, and Muslim, yet united by a shared vision, they birthed what we now know as B8 of Hope.
B8, intentionally pronounced “Beit” or “Bait,” resonates with the meaning of “home” in both Arabic and Hebrew, forging a bridge between languages and cultures. The number 8 holds significance, as it mirrors the count of the co-founders who formed an extraordinary alliance. Their inspiration was kindled by the words of Ali Abu Awwad, a steadfast advocate of nonviolence, who imparted a profound message:
“Beyond the labels of pro-Israel or pro-Palestine, lies a greater calling. By reframing our support towards the ground-level peacebuilders from both sides, we can quell the flames of conflict. True assistance lies in being pro-peaceful solution.”
This heartfelt encounter with Ali Abu Awwad catalyzed their journey, setting them on a path where unity, understanding, and support for grassroots peace initiatives formed the bedrock of B8 of Hope’s mission.
OUR VISION: a more peaceful future based on equal rights, dignity, safety, and self-determination for all the people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.
So far political initiatives and peace processes have failed in resolving the long-lasting and most polarizing conflicts of our times. Today, the hope for a peaceful and sustainable Israeli-Palestinian coexistence lies in the work of grassroots and civil society initiatives. People to people connections and transformations will foster positive changes in the Israeli and Palestinian societies.
Hatred, fear, mistrust, stereotypes, and victimhood must give way to a change in behavior. Israelis and Palestinians must acknowledge each other’s narratives and respect each other’s rights. Only then can they reject violence and live in peace with themselves and with each other by moving forward and building a better future for all.
Hundreds of Israeli and Palestinian civil society and grassroots initiatives on the ground bridge internal and cross-border divides. They create positive changes and bring hope. They need our support to scale up their impact.
OUR MISSION: to support Israeli and Palestinian grassroots and civil society initiatives bringing about dialogue, bridge-building, humanization, transformative interactions and any constructive action improving living conditions
Among the many barriers to peace between Israelis and Palestinians, we focus on four main obstacles to a constructive change:
- Internal divides and challenges inside each community
Israelis do not form a monolithic bloc, nor do the Palestinians. There are many political, ethnic and social divides “inside each side”. To bridge these gaps, we support initiatives that unite rather than polarize, initiatives that enable people to find a common ground and shared values to make a difference, initiatives that encourage people to accept the necessity of a peaceful solution. Unity and inclusiveness are key words. Positive transformations happen with inclusion – not exclusion! - Cross-border divides between Israelis and Palestinians
Despite their close proximity to one another, Israelis and Palestinians live in almost complete separation. Both sides have little knowledge of each other’s lives and too often are raised to fear and hate each other. It is essential to encourage dialogue and bridge-building activities in a place where joint meetings and get-togethers are difficult and dangerous. The impossible becomes achievable when you listen to the “other”, when you hear their narratives and perspectives and share bread together. Their humanity becomes visible, and your shared dreams of a better future for your children become a powerful, uniting force. - Lack of synergies among the peacebuilders
Funds for Israeli and Palestinian peace-building activities are scarce and the challenges on the ground are numerous. This unfortunately creates a climate of competition between peace-building NGOs and movements. Most organizations work in their own bubble and have limited interactions with their peers. B8 of Hope is creating a safe forum for our pool of grantees. They share values and goals, while working separately. Their diversity is an asset, their angles and perspectives can be complementary. Collaboration and partnership make their voice louder. Creating synergies and collaboration opportunities will be a momentous change that will boost the overall impact. This rule also applies to B8 of Hope and its partners in Switzerland, Europe, and the United States. - Polarization outside of Israel and Palestine
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict polarizes public opinion outside of Israel and Palestine. We need to put an end to the inflated influence of external factions and interests. Adding more fuel to the conflict is not helpful. Instead, B8 of Hope promotes a “pro-just and peaceful coexistence” perspective and supports the courageous Israelis and Palestinians on the ground that work tirelessly to pave a path for it.
We support our Israeli and Palestinian grantees in many ways:
- Providing funds for their activities through fund-raising events in Geneva. Our funds come mainly from private Arab, Jewish, international expat, and local Swiss donors.
- Giving visibility to initiatives through conferences, documentary screenings followed by Q/A sessions (these include the peace activists and protagonists from the films), and press and media coverage for interviews and articles.
- Creating networking opportunities with philanthropic institutions and influential decision-makers.
- Offering advice in terms of governance and capacity-building during our due diligence phase and after. We periodically provide an in-depth analysis of our grantees’ reports and management styles, we collaborate with them in order to develop plans to improve infrastructures and put in place capacity-building training.
- Providing a safe forum and platform to promote synergy building activities and workshops: this encourages collaboration between the initiatives and increases their impact while saving funds and energy.
- Creating a community of supporters abroad that is inspired by their work.",<urn:uuid:6b2a2253-88d5-4fe6-a28b-eb29f709b866>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://b8ofhope.org/about-us-2/,2024-02-20T22:58:42Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.938912570476532,1252,1.6630887985229492,2

"Setting up an email address is a crucial step for anyone who wants to run a website. Having an email address that’s associated with your domain name can give your brand a more professional look, and can help you stay organized and communicate with your audience more effectively. One of the most popular ways to set up an email address is through cPanel, which is a control panel used by many web hosting providers. In this article, we’ll walk you through the steps to set up an email address in cPanel.
Step 1: Log in to cPanel
The first step is to log in to your cPanel account. You can usually access cPanel by typing your domain name followed by “/cpanel” in your web browser. For example, if your domain name is “example.com”, you would type “example.com/cpanel” in your browser. You’ll then be prompted to enter your cPanel username and password. If you don’t have this information, you can contact your web hosting provider to get it.
Step 2: Navigate to the “Email Accounts” section
Once you’re logged in to cPanel, you’ll see a dashboard with various sections. Look for the “Email” section and click on “Email Accounts”. This will take you to a page where you can create and manage email accounts.
Step 3: Create a new email account
To create a new email account, click on the “Create” button. You’ll then be taken to a page where you can enter the details for your new email account. First, choose the domain name you want to associate the email address with. If you have multiple domain names, make sure you select the correct one. Next, enter the username you want for your email address. This can be anything you want before the “@” symbol. For example, if you want your email address to be “firstname.lastname@example.org“, you would enter “info” as the username.
Step 4: Set a password for your email account
After you’ve entered the username for your email account, you’ll need to set a password. Make sure you choose a strong password that’s difficult to guess. You can use a password manager to generate a strong password for you. You’ll also need to confirm the password by typing it again in the “Password (again)” field.
Step 5: Set the mailbox size
Next, you’ll need to set the mailbox size for your email account. This is the amount of storage space your email account will have. You can choose a size from the drop-down menu, or enter a custom size. If you’re not sure how much space you need, you can start with a small size and increase it later if necessary.
Step 6: Click “Create Account”
Once you’ve entered all the details for your new email account, click on the “Create Account” button. Your new email account will then be created, and you’ll see a confirmation message on the screen.
Step 7: Access your new email account
Now that you’ve created your new email account, you can access it by clicking on the “Access Webmail” button next to your email account. This will take you to the webmail interface, where you can send and receive emails.
Step 8: Set up your email client
If you prefer to use an email client like Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail, you’ll need to set it up to work with your new email account. To do this, you’ll need to enter the incoming and outgoing server details, as well as your email address and password. These details can usually be found in your cPanel account under the “Email Accounts” section.

"The new organization “NSZZ Solidarity” had to be registered by a court in order to act. This registration process was the subject of lively debate at the CPSU Politburo meeting on October 29. The minutes of this Politburo meeting are included in one of the most extraordinary collections of documents from the Soviet era that have yet been made public by the Russian State Archives. It covers the period between the outbreak of strikes in 1980 and the imposition of martial law on December 13, 1981, a period known as the “Polish Crisis”. As a whole, the material shows that it was a rather clear message that the Soviet leadership conveyed to their Polish Party comrades.
ICCEES’ (International Council for Central and Eastern European Studies) Eight World Congress “Eurasia: Prospects for Wider Communication” took place in Stockholm, Sweden in July 2010. Host was the Swedish Society for the Study of Russia, Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia (Sällskapet ). Here you may read Mikhail Gorbachev´s speech, presented at the Opening Ceremony by Pavel Palazhchenko, advisor and interpreter to Mikhail Gorbachev. Also available is an essay based on Professor Archie Browns key note lecture “Gorbachev and Perestroika: a 25th Anniversary Perspective”. The Opening Ceremony and a discussion between Archie Brown, Jack Matlock, author and US ambassador in Moscow 1987‐1991 and Pavel Palazhchenko is published as video films here.
Gorbachev here emphasize that the essence of glasnost was a real dialogue between authorities and society. The dialogue, he argues here, required a rejection of all forms of censorship and pressure on the mass media, the existence of rights for freedom of assembly, meetings and demonstrations, freedom of conscience, and the creation of public organisations. All this was done in the perestroika years according to Gorbachev.
Professor Archie Brown argues that Gorbachev was not selected as General Secretary because he was a reformer. He did at the time he became party leader believe both that the system was reformable and that it must be reformed. But he did not, however, reveal the full extent of his existing reformism on the eve of perestroika.

"If you also suffer from loud snoring, morning restlessness, morning headaches, and irritability, you may have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder characterized by brief interruptions of breathing during sleep that occurs repeatedly throughout the night. Luckily, there are several sleep apnea treatments available for your sleep apnea in Baltimore, and our team at Spectrum Dental would be more than happy to assist you in finding the best one for you individual needs.
There are two main causes of sleep apnea. The first is caused by improper signals being sent by the brain to the muscles that indicate a problem in your nervous system. This is termed central sleep apnea (CSA). The second and most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is caused by relaxation of soft tissue in the back of the throat, blocking the passage of air. OSA is easily treated with an oral appliance designed to keep your throat open. The oral sleep apnea device is a simple, patient-friendly oral appliance created for noninvasive treatment of sleep apnea and snoring. The appliance works by gently moving the jaw/mandible forward, allowing for a greater degree of airway opening. This will often relieve snoring as well. Oral appliances may be easier to use than other treatment options for sleep apnea. They are non-invasive, small, comfortable, and easy to transport.
A number of devices are available for sleep apnea treatment from Spectrum Dental. You may need to try different devices before finding one that works for you. Once you find the right fit, you'll still need to follow up with us at least every six months during the first year (and then at least once a year after that) to ensure that the fit is still good and to reassess your symptoms. Sleep apnea in Baltimore is treated uniquely from patient to patient, depending on the cause and severity of illness. Those who experience any symptoms of sleep apnea should not hesitate to contact Spectrum Dental for proper treatment. Immediate diagnosis and care can restore proper sleep and save lives.

"$250k policy limits for a client that was injured in an accident while on vacation. Welcome to San Diego!!
The biggest issue in this situation was making sure the client could get the care she needed to recover. The client suffered injuries but did not have health insurance to get care, and she lived in Florida. Fortunately, we were able to work with a law firm in Florida that helped connect the client with great doctors so she was able to get the care needed to recover. At the end of the day, there is no price you can put on your health. We are very happy everything worked out the way it should

"I have really been struggling to do any arts and crafts with Monkey lately. Now LM is on the move she wants to be involved with everything we are doing and I struggle to come up with activities that both a 1 yr old and a 3 1/2 yr old can enjoy (if you have any, please share them!). She only naps once a day now too and I am generally shattered by that point so not much crafting happens then. We do do things occasionally but I rarely blog about them now and I try not to feel too guilty as Monkey is doing plenty at preschool (he now does 1 full day plus 2 mornings a week) but have really been wanting to do something new and fun with him. Tuesday mornings my parents take LM to a rhyme time group and that has become Mummy & Monkey time so today we have been making a glittery firework picture.
Monkey has never seen real fireworks, and has only seen them on cartoons so to start with we watched a youtube clip of a fireworks display and talked about how noisy they are. I also explained about bonfires briefly so we decided to make a picture of a big fire with fireworks around. Monkey helped me tear and cut some red, orange and yellow tissue paper which we then glued to the paper to make the bonfire.
Then came the really messy bit. Glitter doesn’t come out in our house too often because it gets everywhere… but you can’t have fireworks without a bit of sparkle now can you? I showed monkey how to glue some lines and shapes on the paper and he chose the colour glitter to use. He loved pouring the glitter on and then tipping it off to reveal the picture underneath, gasping and proclaiming it was “magic!”
I tried to keep the mess to a minimum and tip the remaining glitter back into each container but there’s only so much you can do with glitter really. For the most part Monkey wanted me to do the gluing for some reason, but I actually preferred his shapes as they were more random so I really encouraged him to do the gluing. Because he enjoyed it so much we made a couple of other pictures just with fireworks on and I really loved his firework shapes.
Monkey loved touching the glitter and wiped it all over his face, saying “look, I’m all lovely and sparkly now!” haha love him.
So there we have it, a very simple fireworks picture. I’ve always loved fireworks and adored making pictures like this when I was a kid so look forward to making many more with Monkey and LM as they grow.",<urn:uuid:502820e2-9c49-47a9-8ceb-f2d8d387d140>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://becomingastayathomemum.com/tag/gluing-and-sticking/,2024-02-20T22:08:44Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9795098304748535,540,1.5632678270339966,2
"Who did you buy an Australian queen from?Bit of an emergency, so would really appreciate some advice.
Came home today to find the hive with the old queen was preparing to swarm. I have absolutely no idea if they have a new queen as on a previous inspection over a week ago I noticed the old queen was laying well and the queen cell that was in there had been removed by the bees completely - so could have hatched or not.
Today we found the hive had kicked out the old queen and she was on the floor outside surrounded by about 700 bees. We scooped her up and put her in a clip, then put her in a nuc with some drawn frames and honey. We made a ramp and her supporters are making their way inside. I have no idea if the nuc will be viable, but may as well try and keep them going. There is probably about 4000 bees left in the hive.
Is the following a good plan: Release the queen when all of her supporters are in and move the nuc to the other side of the garden - about 30m away and behind a hedge and bank of trees. Block the entrance up for 24 hours and then see what happens.
Later today, open the old hive to see if there is any new queen cells / new queen - or should I just leave them?

"Pilsner Malt is a type of pale lager malt made from two-row spring barley that is always highly modified (i.e., good protein degradation) during malting and is kilned to an exceptionally blonde color value of no more than 2.5 to 4 European Brewery Convention (EBC; approx. 1.5° to 2.1° Lovibond). Pale ale malts, by comparison, tend to have a color rating of about 5 to 7 EBC (approximately 2° to 3° Lovibond). Pilsner malt is named after the world’s first blonde lager, the pilsner, developed in the Bohemian city of Pilsen in 1842. See pilsen (plzeň). The base malt of that original Pilsner was made from Haná (also spelled Hanna or Hannah), a common barley variety then grown in Bohemia and Moravia (now part of the Czech Republic). Many of the best modern brewing barley varieties cultivated around the world, including those for pilsner malt, are genetic descendants of the old Haná strain. See haná (barley). In the brewhouse, good pilsner malt should have excellent processing characteristics, including favorable total protein and glucan levels, outstanding enzymatic strength for the conversion of unfermentable grain starches into fermentable malt sugars, excellent lautering properties, and high extract yields. See lautering. Because pilsner malt provides the finished beer with a delicate maltiness, a substantial body and mouthfeel, as well as good foam development and head retention, it is a versatile base malt that is popular not only in traditional pilsner beers and their modern variations but also in low-alcohol beers, light beers, and many blonde Belgian beers, both ales and lagers. See base malt
and mouthfeel. In finished beer, the flavor of pilsner malt tends to be soft, round, direct, and sweetly malty, where pale ale malts will give more color along with toasty, biscuity notes.",<urn:uuid:1df1086c-29bd-4974-8420-f9e68a95482a>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/7Idnq9wJOm/,2024-02-20T21:42:39Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9295058250427246,428,2.260061025619507,2

"US Special Op forces recovered bodies, body parts and at least a hundred surviving children from a tunnel system beneath the White House and Capitol Building in Washington DC on Fri. 29 Jan. In the early morning hours as body bags were being delivered, multiple troops were seen coming out of the White House with at least a hundred children in tow.
The children were believed to have been sexually abused, tortured and killed by political elites in an elaborate tunnel system that ran beneath Capitol Hill and connected to other systems for 200 miles. All was thought part of an international Child Trafficking Ring run by global and political elites with ties to Jeffrey Epstein’s Pedophile Island – that lay next door to Joe Biden’s Water Island.
A couple of days later in the early morning hours of Mon. 1 Feb. and with the US functioning under Martial Law, Joe Biden and 464 elected government officials were said arrested and released inside the Capitol Hill area. Capitol Hill had been surrounded in eight foot high barbed wire fencing since Inauguration Day 20 Jan. Washington DC remained guarded by over 30,000 National Guard troops.
Lines of buses with darkened windows took the children away. On Fri. morning 5 Feb. Dr. Charlie Ward confirmed from his people on the ground at Capitol Hill that the Military did, in fact, rescue children found in rooms and tunnels constructed underneath the White House. Black vans and buses with darkened windows picked up the children for medical treatment and de briefing. Evidently they discovered multiple corpses and a lot of body bags were going into the area. See video: Pedophile Ring Investigation Centers Around White House, Capitol Building as Children Surface! – Must Video | Opinion – Conservative | Before It’s News
Since Oct. 2019 tortured, malnourished children and corpses in the tens of thousands have been found in a sophisticated network of Deep Underground Military Bases (DUMBS) that ran beneath the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Asia and across Europe. For over a year US Special Forces had been in training for the rescue missions which began on Oct. 16 2019 with the rescue of caged babies and children beneath the China Lake Navy facility in California.
A military operation of 10,000 Marines and Navy Seals rescued an unbelievable 2,100 children being held in cages in underground tunnels at China Lake. The children and teens were said to have been sexually abused, tortured and killed to collect their Adrenichrome. Marines, Navy Seals Rescue 2,100 Caged Children, Teens

"Renowned analyst Benjamin Cowen argues that many altcoins may not survive the year-long crypto winter. In a new YouTube video, Cowen forecasts that altcoins will plateau.
Cowen expects another difficult period for smaller altcoins in the months ahead, right into 2024. He expects altcoins to undergo a depression before a resurgence in 2025.
Will Altcoins Experience a Rebirth?
Some altcoins will reveal their true value in the intervening period, while others will disappear or not record any all-time high in the next bull market. He argues this trend has occurred in previous cycles.
All cryptocurrencies may not enjoy an all-time high during bull markets as Bitcoin (BTC) does, he argues.
Fed Will Be Biggest Altcoin Influencer
“I think this is the depression phase. I do think it’s coming. And then I think what comes after it is the altcoin Renaissance, but that doesn’t come until the Fed pivots.”
The analyst does not believe the US central bank will alter its current course.
“There’s a chance that they pivot this year, but I just don’t think they’re going to. If they do pivot this year, that doesn’t mean the altcoin market is going to immediately go back up.”
Any change in the Fed policy will be accompanied by a recession, which is generally bearish for altcoins or Bitcoin.

"The Ripple XRP price has increased since completing its double bottom pattern on Sept. 12.
However, the upward movement could not be sustained and the XRP price is at risk of breaking down below the $0.49 support area.
XRP Creates Bullish Pattern – Fails to Sustain Increase
The daily time frame technical analysis for XRP shows that the price has increased since Sept. 11. The increase completed a double bottom, considered a bullish pattern. After the double bottom, XRP began the current upward movement, which is still ongoing.
Read More: Best Crypto Sign-Up Bonuses in 2023.
After the second bottom, XRP broke out from a descending resistance line that had been in place since the yearly high in July. Due to these two bullish developments, the XRP price was expected to increase significantly after the breakout.
However, this was not the case. The upward movement culminated with a high of $0.52 on September 20 and the price has fallen since, rapidly approaching its pre-breakout levels.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) gives a mixed reading, though it is leaning bullish.
While the RSI is increasing, it has not moved above 50 yet. However, the double bottom pattern was combined with bullish divergence in the RSI, something which preceded the entire breakout.
The RSI is a momentum indicator used by traders to evaluate whether a market is overbought or oversold, and to determine whether to accumulate or sell an asset. Readings above 50 and an upward trend suggest that bulls still have an advantage, while readings below 50 indicate the opposite.
In any case, the RSI has to move and stay above 50 to confirm the bullish trend reversal.
XRP Price Prediction: Bounce or Breakdown?
Similar to the daily time frame, the six-hour one offers mixed readings.
On the bullish side, XRP has reclaimed the $0.49 horizontal area after previously falling below it (red circle). Currently, it seems to be in the process of validating it as support.
However, the price has also broken down from a short-term ascending support line. This is a bearish sign that suggests the previous upward movement has now ended. Moreover, the six-hour RSI has fallen below 50 (red icon) and is decreasing.
Therefore, if the XRP price falls below the $0.49 horizontal support area, it can decrease by another 7% and reach the $0.46 support. On the other hand, a strong bounce can take the price to the previous ascending support line at $0.52. This would be an increase of 5%.
It is worth mentioning that there is no major news regarding the Ripple vs. SEC case. In less important news, Ben Armstrong, alias BitBoy, is asking for XRP donations to fund his legal action against the parent company of the BitBoy Crypto brand which recently fired him.
To conclude, the future XRP price prediction will be determined by whether the price breaks down from the $0.49 horizontal support area or bounces. A 5% increase can occur in case of a bounce while a 7% drop is likely if the price breaks down.

"Donald Trump took a preemptive victory lap in Nevada on Saturday, 12 days before he is expected to sweep the state’s delegates in Nevada’s Feb. 8 Republican presidential caucuses.
After his victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, the former president held a “Commit to Caucus” rally in Las Vegas Saturday afternoon. The former president is still battling Nikki Haley for the Republican nomination as they compete in the Feb. 24 primary in her home state of South Carolina.
But in a situation that has proved confusing for many Nevada voters, Trump and Haley’s names are not appearing on the same ballot in two separate Nevada contests, which will take place more than two weeks before the South Carolina primary.
Trump is now the only major candidate competing in the Nevada caucuses, the contest run by the state Republican Party that will award the state’s 26 delegates.
“With the help of everyone here today, we’re going to secure a gigantic win in the Nevada caucuses,” Trump said Saturday. “We’re not going to have a lot of competition, I think, but it doesn’t matter. We want to get a great, beautiful mandate.”
Haley — who was facing a potentially embarrassing loss to Trump in a caucus that is likely to be dominated by GOP base voters loyal to the former president — opted not to compete in that contest. Instead, she placed her name on the ballot in the state-run primary that will take place two days earlier on Feb. 6, a contest that Nevada Republican leaders have described as a waste of taxpayer dollars. Haley’s vote tally will be largely symbolic because no Republican delegates will be awarded through the primary process.
Haley, a former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor, is the only remaining major GOP presidential contender on the primary ballot, which all Nevada voters are receiving in the mail. Former vice president Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) had also planned to compete in the primary, but both have since suspended their campaigns. Primary voters also have an option to choose “none of these candidates” when they fill out their ballot.
Trump told his audience on Saturday that the primary was irrelevant: “Don’t waste your time on primary, waste all of your time on caucus,” he said. “Because the primary doesn’t mean anything.”
Under rules that were designed by Trump allies who control Nevada’s Republican Party, presidential candidates were barred from competing in both the state-run primary and the party-run GOP caucuses — and had to choose one or the other.
“Talk to the people in Nevada, they will tell you the caucuses have been sealed up, bought and paid for a long time. So that’s why we got into the primary,” Haley said when asked by reporters last week why she wasn’t participating in the Nevada caucuses. “That’s the Trump train rolling through that. But we’re going to focus on the states that are fair.”
Introducing the former president at the rally on Saturday, Michael McDonald, the Nevada Republican Party chair, said he had recently talked to Trump: “I guarantee you Nevada will show up and we will deliver you 100 percent of delegates for the state in Nevada to Donald Trump.”
Jim DeGraffenreid, a Republican National Committee member in Nevada, defended the party’s rules and its effort to opt out of the state-run primary. He said the candidates were “very clear with us that they didn’t have a lot of interest in competing in two separate contests in the same state,” adding that it “made sense all around to say candidates would need to compete in one or the other — and we would award delegates only out of one of them.”
DeGraffenreid said that Republican Party officials did not agree with the rules governing the primary process that were crafted by Democratic lawmakers: “We don’t agree with sending out universal mail-in ballots that maybe go to voters who are no longer here,” he said. “ … We obviously will play by those rules in a state election where we’re required to do it. But in the party nominating process, we didn’t feel like it made any sense for us to loosen the security of that election.”
Still, DeGraffenreid acknowledged that the existence of two contests has created significant confusion. He said the party received more than 900 voice mails on Thursday night alone — with many voters expressing confusion about why Trump is not on their primary ballot.
Last year, the Trump campaign engaged in an intensive state-by-state effort to influence state party leaders and shape party rules to improve his chances of amassing as many delegates as possible and wrapping up the nomination fight early. State party rules and leaders determine the processes that lead to the selection of presidential nominating delegates.
During that state-by-state courtship, Nevada Republican Party leaders were invited to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club where they discussed the 2024 caucuses process and the politics of the state, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting.
Late last year, a Nevada grand jury charged six Republicans who claimed to be presidential electors in 2020 and submitted certificates to Congress falsely asserting that Trump had won the election in their state. The group included McDonald and DeGraffenreid.
Nevada’s unusual situation this year — with both a primary and caucuses a few days apart — stemmed from Republicans’ objections to a 2021 law championed by the state’s Democrats and passed by the legislature mandating that major political parties with more than one candidate hold a primary on the first Tuesday in February.
Republican leaders in the state, some of whom had echoed Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 election results, objected to holding a primary at taxpayer expense and to the fact that every voter would receive a ballot in the mail, among other issues. The Republican Party of Nevada sued the state, seeking an order that would allow the party to opt out of the state primary and keep their caucuses.
In the lawsuit, filed by Republican National Committee member and attorney Sigal Chattah, the Nevada GOP argued that the 2021 law mandating the state-run primary violated the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of association. Political parties, the lawsuit said, “are self-governed and not subject to state interference/influence as to how its presidential candidates are chosen.”
The party ultimately dropped its lawsuit after the judge sided with the attorney general’s office allowing the primary to proceed. But the judge affirmed the Nevada GOP’s right to hold caucuses and to award delegates as they pleased through that contest.
The GOP caucuses are conducted in person. In the primary, every registered voter in Nevada will receive a ballot in the mail and may also cast their ballot at early voting locations between Saturday and Friday, or on Feb. 6 at their polling location.
President Biden appears on the Democratic primary ballot along with author Marianne Williamson. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who has challenged Biden in some states, is not participating in Nevada.

"When you think about it, your bathroom is one of the most important rooms in your home. Not only does it need to function as a place to pee and poop, but it needs to be clean and hygienic as well. Unfortunately, bathrooms can sometimes be overlooked in terms of maintenance, which can lead to costly problems down the road. In this blog post, we’ll take a look at some of the hidden costs of having a bathroom and how you can prevent them from happening.

What Do You Need to Know About Leaks?
There are a few things to consider when it comes to plumbing leaks: the location of the leak, the severity of the leak, and how likely it is that the leak will cause harm. Leaks can be in any area of your home, but they’re more common in bathrooms and kitchens. Look for leaks around faucets, sinks, toilets, showers and bathtubs. A small leak can slowly fill up with water and cause a lot of damage over time. A bigger or more severe leak can overflow and cause serious flooding. A leaking faucet may not cause any harm if it’s just dripping mildly all day long. But if the water is constantly gushing out and causing flooding, you could be putting your family at risk. Look for signs of flooding – like standing water on the floor – to determine whether a leak is causing a problem.
How To Fix a Leak
If you have a dripping or flooding issue in your bathroom, there are a few things you can do to fix the problem. If the issue is small and can be solved with a plunger and buckets, then by all means try that first. If the problem is more serious or if it’s outside of your DIY abilities, then hiring a professional plumber may be the best option for you. Here are some of the hidden costs of hiring a plumber: Estimated price range: From $75 to $175 per hour. Costs associated with travel time (if necessary to get to your home) . Possible charges for lost work time due to repair/replacement. Fees for equipment used, such as snake charmers or water jetting
What to do if Water Comes Into Your House Through the Drain
If water comes into your house through the drain, here are some things to do: Check to see if the water is coming from a fixture or pipe that isn’t functioning properly. If it’s coming from a fixture, check to see if it’s cracked or leaking. If it’s leaking, fix the issue and then turn off the water to the fixture so that you can assess the damage. Look for blockages in pipes and drainage systems. These can be caused by debris, leaves, twigs and other objects that have built up over time.",<urn:uuid:18baf8db-1446-4e2c-8a01-adddad395110>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://bestscrollsaw.info/plumbing-pros-the-hidden-costs-of-your-bathroom/,2024-02-20T22:53:23Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9504944086074829,722,1.628083348274231,2
"I just purchased a eufyCam E system, and so far I like it very much. It replaced a 1st generation Arlo system that has been updated by newer models.
One of the features I did like about the Arlo system is that I could log onto my cameras using my desktop (Windows) computer. This was very convenient.
Can the Eufy system do this also? It’s not a dealbreaker, but, like I said, it was very convenient.
I guess you could do a very round about way of getting an Android emulator like Andy and then downloading the android app so you could view it on your computer?
@eufy_cams2 You can access the live stream and cloud stored footage via the web portal https://mysecurity.eufylife.com but you will require a browser which supports flash player. Hopefully they will develop a more comprehensive method of accessing footage on desktops but they do have quite a growing list of features requested / announced which have yet to make an appearance.
Thanks. I’ll give it a try.
@eufy_cams2 don’t get surprised when you log into the portal on desktop, it will kick you out of the app on phone. So, you have to login again into the app.
Also, only live sreaming works with the portal, unless you have a subscription to eufy cloud storage, you cannot view the recordings.

"I recently purchased these Liberty Air 2 earbuds. Brilliant audio quality, battery life, etc. My only issue is with making and receiving phone calls or using any app that needs me to speak such as WhatsApp or Zoom.
Making/receiving such calls works perfectly: I can hear the other party and they can hear me. No issues with audio quality or connectivity.
But I can’t hear my own voice. The earbuds are such a great fit they really do block out all external sound. For this use, this makes the earbuds no good at all. I’ve not tried using just a single bud, maybe that’s the solution? Hardly a great experience, though.
I’ll add that I have a pair of Bose Bluetooth wireless earphones and while they let me hear my own voice, the latency is terrible with a gap of about half a second from speaking to hearing my voice. Not good at all. Is that likely to be the case as well with the Liberty Air 2 earbuds?

"Two Canadian tech companies, D2L and E Automotive, began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) today.
Kitchener-Waterloo-based EdTech company D2L began trading under the symbol ‘DTOL,’ generating $150 million in gross proceeds from its IPO. The offering saw 5.4 million shares by D2L and a secondary offering of 3.3 million shares from the Desire2Learn Employee Stock Trust, with each subordinate voting share priced at $17 CAD.
E Automotive (E Inc) also joined the growing roster of Canadian tech companies that have gone public on the TSX since this summer. It began trading today under the symbol ‘EINC,’ and expects to close its IPO on November 10. The company is offering 5.9 million shares each priced at $23, for gross proceeds of $135.7 million.
UPDATE 10/11/2021: E Inc. has closed its IPO, selling 5.9 million common shares priced at $23 per share. The company generated $135.7 million CAD in gross proceeds. If the over-allotment option is exercised in full, E Inc. could receive an additional $20.35 million.
Since July 2020, the TSX has seen a streak of Canadian tech IPOs. Including E Automotive and D2L, 19 tech firms have gone public on the exchange during this period, compared to 12 in the previous 11 years ending December 2019, according to The Globe and Mail. Despite this trend, the performance of recent Canadian tech IPOs has been mixed, as some, like Q4, have been forced to cut the size and pricing of their offerings, and continue to trade below their issue price.
Ahead of its TSX listing, D2L also reduced the size and pricing of its IPO, originally planning to sell about 9.5 million to 10.5 million shares, with each being sold within the $19 to $21 price range, for about $200 million in potential gross proceeds.
RELATED: D2L cuts size, pricing of TSX IPO
According to The Globe, D2L decided to reduce the size and pricing of its offering in a bid to complete its IPO, better reflect demand for its offering, and incentivize institutions who had agreed to buy in to stay committed.
TD Securities Inc. and BMO Capital Markets co-led D2L’s offering as underwriters and bookrunners, joined with Canaccord Genuity Corp., Raymond James Ltd., RBC Capital Markets, National Bank Financial Inc. and Eight Capital.
The underwriters have also been granted an over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1,323,750 subordinate voting shares from D2L at a price of $17.00 per share. If the option is exercised in full, D2L would receive $22.5 million in additional capital.
Founded in 1999 by CEO and president John Baker, a then 22-year-old University of Waterloo engineering student, D2L was bootstrapped until 2012, when it secured $80 million in venture financing.
The company is the developer behind Brightspace, a cloud-based software platform for the delivery of courses, learning-based games, and assessments online or in-person. D2L serves 970 K-12, higher education, and corporate customers, comprising over 14 million users across more than 40 countries. D2L’s clients include many of Canada’s universities and colleges.
D2L (formerly Desire2Learn) intends to use the funds from the treasury portion of the offering to “strengthen its financial position and pursue its growth strategies.”
Approximately $20 million CAD of the net proceeds from D2L’s IPO will repay a loan the firm made to a holding company affiliated with Baker earlier this year. The prospectus states this loan was designed to cover $16.6 million in outstanding income tax liabilities connected to a 2012 share distribution that included three of Baker’s siblings, after a 2016 audit by the Canada Revenue Agency. These proceeds will also see these siblings pay $3.6 million in relation to the exercise of D2L share options.
E Inc originally filed to go public mid-October, with its offering made through a group of underwriters led by Canaccord Genuity Corp., CIBC Capital Markets and National Bank Financial Inc., joined by Scotiabank, Eight Capital, ATB Capital Markets Inc. and Laurentian Bank Securities Inc.
The Toronto-based auto retail company created its digital vehicle marketplace EDealer in 2004, which allows dealers to track vehicle inventory and make it available to potential buyers through a digital showroom. In 2016, E Inc launched EBlock, a live auction platform for car dealers and buyers.
According to E Inc. CEO Jason McClenahan, the company currently has a compounded annual growth rate of 97 percent over the past three years. Its prospectus stated that it generated approximately $1.3 billion USD in gross transaction value in the last 12 months ending on June 30.
McClenahan also states in the prospectus that E Inc. intends to direct its “rapid trajectory of growth” to the United States by introducing new products.
Additionally, the auto retailer also plans to use the proceeds from the IPO to bolster its acquisition strategy. Most recently, it completed its acquisition of Auto Buyline Systems to strengthen its position in the US West Coast, and also bolster its presence in Quebec through the purchases of ESP and TradeHelper.

"Weekend Preview – 26th November 2021
Six local sports fixtures will brave the potentially wintery weather this weekend. If you are planning to watch any game, then check before you travel (both on transport and the games). Keep an eye on our Twitter @BeverleyFMSport. We will keep you up to date on any changes.
Beverley Town return to Humber Premier League action. It has been a difficult month of postponements and poor results; Town will aim to get back to winning ways as soon as possible. Chalk Lane managed to pick up a draw last time the two sides faced each other but have not been impressive so far this season.
Hull City could be four wins from four following the visit of Millwall. The Tigers have had a sudden surge of form in recent weeks. Victories over lower table rivals Cardiff and Barnsley have lifted City away from the relegation zone. Millwall have consistently drawn games this season and are on a run of three draws in a row but are sat just outside the play-offs and will offer City a challenge.
Hall Road Rangers are powering up the NCEL Division One. This weekend is another opportunity to further their position in the league with a trip away to Dronfield. Rangers have won four of the last five only drawing the other. The hosts have lost the last two but were five unbeaten in a topsy-turvy first half of the campaign. Oliver Harlsey has more ahead of Dronfield vs Hall Road.
North Ferriby FC welcome Nostell Miners Welfare to the Dransfield Stadium on Saturday hoping to consolidate the top spot and their unbeaten league start. It has been a busy seven days for the Villagers with a penalty defeat to North Shields coupled with a league win at Teversal in midweek. The Villagers have provided a pre-match report.
Beverley RUFC have a difficult task against third-placed Pontefract on Saturday. The Beavers lost last week in a feisty derby with Bridlington. Chairman Brian Gilbert does not expect much from the fixture tomorrow but hopes for a good performance.
Hull City Ladies enter the second round of the FA Cup at home to Liverpool Feds. The Tigresses picked up their first win of the season last time out. They come up against a Feds team which have been on some impressive form and lead their league. During the week Carol Thomas has been inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame.

"As homeowners in Scottsdale, Arizona, continue to embrace the convenience and luxury of home automation, the demand for reliable and trustworthy home automation companies has never been higher. While there are many companies to choose from, it’s important to consider the size of the company when making your decision.
While larger companies may offer more resources and a wider range of products, there are risks associated with choosing a company that has grown too big. One of the biggest risks is that as companies grow, they may lose sight of their customers and their needs. This can lead to a decline in customer service and a lack of attention to detail. You will also get a different tech visit your home at a service call and not know anything about you or your system.
At BeyondAudio, we believe that staying true to our roots as a smaller, local company has allowed us to maintain our commitment to white glove customer service. Our personalized consultations and attention to detail set us apart from larger companies that may prioritize profits over customer satisfaction.
Another risk associated with larger companies is that they may become too focused on promoting their brand rather than providing quality products and services. This can lead to a lack of innovation and a failure to keep up with the latest trends and technologies in the industry.",<urn:uuid:cc3bff9a-c116-4e2e-9b04-c9e550497862>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://beyondaudio.com/tag/vip/,2024-02-20T21:42:38Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9724277257919312,255,1.0857443809509277,1

"From the moment God gave directions about the building and the furnishing of the Tabernacle and Tent of Meeting, architecture and theology were married forever within the context of worship. Over time, the worship of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob moved from the Tabernacle to Jewish Temple and during the captivity, the Jewish Synagogue. After Jesus Christ, that worship moved to the Christian gathering, and more importantly the theology of the presence of God moved from the Holy of Holies within the Temple, into the heart of the redeemed believer (1 Corinthians 6:19). The question that arises from this transformation is how has the theological influence on the architecture of worship changed along with it?
While there were very specific biblical requirements for the Temple, there were none for the Synagogue. Christian worship likewise had no biblical physical requirements. However, one thing is very obvious about Christian worship, from the very beginning and for its first two hundred plus years, its architecture was very informal. Since people met in houses or any available structure that allowed them to gather for worship in the midst of persecution; very little concern was placed on architecture. People stood or sat on the floor, since most worship meetings occurred in the house’s upper room, which was an open space used for dining and most people sat on the floor or reclined while eating.
For over two hundred years, Christian worship was almost a family affair, in private homes. There appeared to be no “theology of spaces” involved. One reason might be the Christian view that the new temple was the human heart and that a Christian’s body was the Temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19). The veil separating the Holy of Holies had been rent, the Jewish Temple was destroyed, and God had taken up residence in the heart of his people. Wherever two or more gathered, the place not being significant, there was Christ in their midst.
It was not until the late third century when the Church began to grow and then in the early fourth century when it became the official religion of the Roman Empire that things changed. However, these changes were not for biblical reasons. They were for political and sociological reasons. The Church had become too important to be consigned to homes. It now was out in the public eye and it wanted a public presence, befitting the official religion of Rome who still shined with much of her former glory. The Church needed grand structures for grand events, with all of the pomp and circumstance befitting its place in the Empire.
While biblical models would be mined from ancient examples, it is important to remember that there was no biblical warrant. God did not command, like he had done for the Hebrews, any demand for a specific physical space for the Church. All such practices and traditions which built up in the Church since the late third century were done for other than biblical reasons. They are the traditions of the Church, which soon split between East and West, and developed competing requirements for sacred spaces, a foreshadowing of what would come with the Reformation and its own multiplication of requirements along with its additions and deletions from what came before.
Yet throughout the centuries of Christian worship, there has never been a biblical requirement for the place where Christians worship. All requirements came through the governance of the Church who made them, whether Roman, Eastern, Anglican, Baptist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, or any other denomination or expression of the Christian faith.
So, how did we get to where we are? Why do we have pews, altars, stained glass or clear glass, organs, railings, rood screens, baptisteries, lecterns, bell towers, choir lofts, and all the other accoutrement of our worship spaces? What, if anything, is important and what is not? I do not have the answers at the moment, but hopefully I will learn some of the reasons why over the next year as I investigate this area.
There is one scripture that I feel God has given me to help me remember what I should not forget during this search. Like it was for Elijah, it is important for me to remember something fundamental about the God with whom I have to do.
And he said, “Go out and stand on the mount before the LORD.” And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a low whisper. 1Kings 19:11-12
God was, is, and always will be in his word, even when it is merely a whisper.

"Several low cost carriers fly at Katowice Airport as an alternative to Krakow. This usually saves a lot on airfare, but keep in mind that Katowice Airport is located 100 kilometers from the city of Krakow. There’s no train station near the airport, so take a 1.5 hour journey by bus or taxi into account. Below are the best options for travelling from Katowice Airport to Krakow.
If you want to get from the airport in Katowice to Krakow, there are two good travel options: a special airport taxi and the airport bus. You can also hop into a regular cab at the airport, but those have higher rates and chauffeurs may not speak English. Alternatively there are several options to rent a car already at Katowice airport, and make your own way to Krakow.
Taxi from Katowice Airport
You can pre-book an airport taxi from Katowice to Krakow. This will cost you around € 80 (£72) one-way. This taxi is suitable for 4 persons. Reserving for more people through that website will set you back for around € 115 (£103). A minibus can hold up to 6 people, making this a very good deal when traveling with a group from Katowice. The company checks your flight number to make sure your driver is waiting when you arrive, even if there’s a delay. They have English speaking drivers. The chauffeur will drop you off at your hotel or apartment within the city. Their website allows you to pay with PayPal or credit card.
Katowice Airport by bus
The minibuses from Matuszek take you from the airport to Katowice city centre or Krakow. You’ll arrive at the main train station in Krakow. From there, you have to find your own way to the hotel either by taxi, bus, tram or on foot. A one-way bus ticket is € 11 (£9) per person. The busses try to follow the flight schedules of Ryanair and Wizz air as close as possible. Book at least 2 days in advance via their website.
Car rental Katowice Airport
Are you planning to drive a rental car in Krakow? You can choose to pick up the car at Katowice airport at arrival and drive yourself to Krakow. Through Sunny Cars you can rent cars for as low as € 40 a day. A bigger car will cost you less than € 50. The car can be returned to Katowice Airport when flying back home. Keep some change handy for the tollbooths ons the way to Krakow.

"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a new warning about the Big Olaf Creamery ice cream recall. It’s tied to an outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes that had already caused multiple deaths.
The agency is concerned that retailers may still be selling Big Olaf ice cream products. It’s urging those companies to dispose of the Big Olaf ice cream supply.
With that in mind, it’s urgent that you make note of this warning and avoid buying any recalled ice cream. And people who already have recalled Big Olaf ice cream at home should not eat it.
Big Olaf Creamery ice cream recall
Per WFLA, Big Olaf Creamery issued a recall for its Sarasota line of products on July 8th. That’s when the company stopped production at the facility. The information comes from the Florida Department of Health (FL DOH).
The FDA notes in its warning that it is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the FL DOH, and the Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services (FDACS) to investigate the Listeria outbreak.
Epidemiological information from the CDC and FL DOH indicate that Big Olaf products are the likely source of the outbreak. A total of 23 people from 10 states got the Listeria strain. Of 18 people who authorities had interviewed, all reported eating this particular brand of ice cream.
The FDA says in its Listeria outbreak warning that 22 people have been hospitalized so far. According to the CDC investigation, the first cases date back to January 2021. The agencies have registered one adult death and one miscarriage so far.
Why Listeria is dangerous
Listeria monocytogenes is often a cause of food product recalls. The bacteria can survive and grow on refrigerated products like the Big Olaf ice cream in this recall.
In healthy individuals, the bacteria will typically cause mild symptoms that can include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. More severe versions of the illness can lead to headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions.
Symptoms often appear a few days after consuming a contaminated product. But can sometimes take several weeks for symptoms to present themselves.
Young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised people might risk developing a potentially fatal illness. Moreover, pregnant women risk miscarriages, stillbirths, and baby infections.
WFLA noted the case of a Massachusetts woman who suffered a miscarriage after eating Big Olaf ice cream. Her family is now suing the company.
A family of an Illinois woman who died following a Listeria infection is also suing the company.
Big Olaf said in a recent statement that nothing has been proven at this point.
Big Olaf Company’s response
“For now it is only speculation as it is an ongoing investigation, our brand has not been confirmed to be linked to these cases, I am not sure why only Big Olaf is being mentioned and targeted,” Big Olaf Company wrote in a statement on Facebook.
The statement continues, “The original report we got from the Florida Department of Health on Friday July 1st, was that there are 23 cases reported, the first one reported was January 2021. 6 out of the 23 patients mentioned having consumed Big Olaf ice cream, but nothing has been proven. We have been cooperating with the Florida Department of Health, FDACS and the FDA as soon as we were informed about the situation. We have been transparent and have answered all their questions and provided them with all the information requested from us, as the health and well being of the public is our first priority.”
What you should do
If you own any Big Olaf ice cream products from this recall, you should heed the FDA’s advice and throw them out immediately. Make sure you clean all the surfaces the ice cream might have come in contact with to avoid the risk of cross-contamination and infection.
The FDA has handling and cleaning advice at this link.
People who experience symptoms that might point to a Listeria infection should contact a doctor. Testing will be required to determine whether the Listeria bacteria is the culprit.

"Choir rehearses for virtual concert
January 21, 2021
Students participating in choir during the pandemic were unable to perform a traditional choir concert. The solution to this complication was to have a virtual form of the concert. Choir students were recorded by AV Coordinator Adam Umbreit once the song was ready. The video of the concert was only sent to families. It could not be published for the public due to copyright laws.
Junior Alexa Fleegal describes the important procedures taken to make this performance successful and safe.
“We practiced our music and we had to reconfigure our standing arrangement for the singing portion because we were usually seven to eight feet apart, but we were six feet apart to sing. The honors students got into groups of three or four,” Fleegal said. “We also did introductions for each of the songs for the whole concert. When we recorded the singing pieces in our six feet arrangement, AV Coordinator Adam Umbreit came and he recorded it for us.”
Fleegal gives insight to how this version of their concert is better than the traditional in-person version of their concert.
“I think there are certain aspects that are better than when we do it in-person. I think it is more accessible to people so people who might be in nursing homes or people who might not be able to get a ride. I think it also helps with time conflicts,” Fleegal said.
Constructing their first virtual concert did come with challenges. They had to work together, and consistently work hard to make it audibly appealing.
“We had to work on being more confident and sounding louder, and also our pronunciation because it is hard to hear us with our masks,” Fleegal said.
Having the virtual concert showed people outside of choir that the students are continuing with drive and ambition to advance their skills.
“We wanted to get our songs and our voices out there and to show everyone we are still doing something in choir,” sophomore Ethan Brunke said.
By giving students access to watch themselves perform, it gave them the ability to track their progress. This was beneficial to Brunke.
“Now we have a way to look back in the future and see what we did this year and to show us how far we might have come in the future,” Brunke said.
Brunke found enjoyment problem solving the best way to display the concert virtually. It gave them a chance to play with different virtual platforms.
“Just kind of working with a different form of media and the fact that it was a recorded kind of thing,” Brunke said.
Senior Joanna Schmidt found positives within these obstacles as well. She came to the realization that performing this way can be helpful to students’ mental health by reducing stress levels.
“It was beneficial because we could redo it if we messed up and we didn’t have the stress of an actual concert,” Schmidt said.
As a whole, having to differentiate individual voices within the audio was a struggle for the performers.
“The biggest struggle was being able to hear my voice from far away and being able to pick out my own voice from the group. We had to adapt and once we did we worked really hard with what we had,” Schmidt said.",<urn:uuid:8b9f0914-66eb-47e3-b87a-979ba262a9f5>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://bhsrng.com/1400/news/choir-rehearses-for-virtual-concert/,2024-02-20T22:53:42Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.986121654510498,689,1.5167913436889648,2

"Stuttering, also known as stammering, is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases as well as involuntary silent pauses or blocks in which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The term stuttering is most commonly associated with involuntary sound repetition, but it also encompasses the abnormal hesitation or pausing before speech, referred to by people who stutter as blocks, and the prolongation of certain sounds, usually vowels or semivowels. For many people who stutter, repetition is the primary problem. Blocks and prolongations are learned mechanisms to mask repetition, as the fear of repetitive speaking in public is often the main cause of psychological unease. The term “stuttering” covers a wide range of severity, encompassing barely perceptible impediments that are largely cosmetic to severe symptoms that effectively prevent oral communication.",<urn:uuid:2557d6e2-b528-446b-ae8e-d08277b4ae1b>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://bigacare.com/stuttering/,2024-02-20T23:20:59Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.975647509098053,190,3.87681245803833,4

"Is the Genesis Apocryphon real?
The Genesis Apocryphon was the most damaged out of the first four scrolls found in Cave 1 making the publication history difficult, lengthy yet interesting. The scroll is dated palaeographical to 25 BCE through 50 CE which coincides with the radiocarbon dating estimate of 89 BCE-118 CE.
What books are missing from the Dead Sea Scrolls?
The Dead Sea Scrolls include fragments from every book of the Old Testament except for the Book of Esther. Scholars have speculated that traces of this missing book, which recounts the story of the eponymous Jewish queen of Persia, either disintegrated over time or have yet to be uncovered.
What is the Book of Enoch found in the Dead Sea Scrolls?
Aramaic fragments of many parts of the book were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, as were Hebrew fragments of the Book of Noah, either one of the sources of Enoch or a parallel elaboration of the same material. Passages of the Book of Noah were included in Enoch by its redactor (editor).
Is there a book of Noah?
The Book of Noah is thought to be a non-extant Old Testament pseudepigraphal work, attributed to Noah. It is quoted in several places in another pseudepigraphal work, 1 Enoch, and is mentioned in another, the Book of Jubilees. There have also been fragments attributed to a Book of Noah in the Dead Sea Scrolls.
When were the Dead Sea scrolls hidden?
The Scrolls appear to be the library of a Jewish sect which was hidden away in caves around the outbreak of the Jewish-Roman War (66 C.E.).
Does the Vatican have Dead Sea Scrolls?
The scrolls, written on treated leather hides in Greek, Aramaic and Hebrew, were produced in the years when Christianity was taking shape on the eve of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 A.D. They will remain on show at the Vatican’s library for three months.
What is the Genesis Apocryphon?
The Genesis Apocryphon was one of the seven major scrolls found at Qumran in Cave 1. It is one of the collection in the Dead Sea Scrolls, which has over 800 documents in fragmentary form.
Is the Apocryphon the source for jubilees?
Because the scroll also contains material related to that found in First Book of Enoch, the Genesis Apocryphon was possibly the source for both Jubilees and 1 Enoch. Written in Palestine in Aramaic, the scroll is the earliest example of a pseudepigraphal work in that language and is important for the study of its linguistic development.
What is the size of the Apocryphon?
It is 13 inches in length and 2.75 inches in width at its widest point in the middle. The Genesis Apocryphon was one of the seven major scrolls found at Qumran in Cave 1. It is one of the collection in the Dead Sea Scrolls, which has over 800 documents in fragmentary form.
What are the three books of the Apocryphon?
It can be separated into books; the Book of Lamech, the Book of Noah and the Book of Abraham. The Genesis Apocryphon is largely based upon 1 Enoch, the Book of Jubilees and Genesis and therefore was most likely written after them.",<urn:uuid:e663be03-811a-4f0c-95ef-5205df42a99c>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://bigsurspiritgarden.com/2022/11/17/is-the-genesis-apocryphon-real/,2024-02-20T22:23:22Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9645259380340576,699,3.173837661743164,3
"We can explore the farthest reaches of the Universe, but can’t even complete our own cosmic backyard.
The history of astronomy has been a history of receding horizons. The invention of the telescope took us beyond our naked-eye capabilities, to millions (and later billions) of stars within our own Milky Way. The application of photography and multi-wavelength astronomy to telescopes brought us beyond our own galaxy, to the distant “island Universes” populating all the space we can access. Yet, for all we know about the distant Universe, there still may be undiscovered worlds in our own Solar System. Why is that? Joseph Cummens wants to know, asking:
If scientists can use telescopes to hunt planets, galaxies, exoplanets, etc., then why can’t we scan our solar system for the elusive Planet X or other celestial bodies within our home system?
As far as we’ve peered into the Universe, we still have a long way to go, even in our own backyard.
There’s a key word you need to understand that puts the entire question into perspective: magnitude. From an astronomical perspective, every object has an intrinsic brightness to it, defined by the amount of light it gives off. For an object like our Sun, this is due to its own luminance, since the Sun creates its own energy and emits it in all directions. For an object like our Moon, this is due to its reflected luminance, since it only reflects the light from other objects. The Moon has no self-luminance of its own.
If you look at the Moon during its crescent phase, you can actually make out the signal from the lunar surface that isn’t illuminated by the Sun. This isn’t some trick of the Moon’s atmosphere (since it has virtually none), but rather is due to Earthshine: sunlight reflected off of the Earth and onto the Moon.
The difference in brightness between these examples showcases how extreme the difference between reflected luminance and self-luminance are.
But there’s another thing that’s exemplified by the extreme brightness differences between the Sun and Moon, and the Moon and everything else in the night sky. The Moon has no right to appear brighter than every star, planet, or galaxy in the sky based on its own pitiful magnitude. Intrinsically, the Moon is the faintest object visible with the naked eye from anywhere on Earth. Yet it appears brighter than everything except the Sun!
The reason for this is that the Moon is so close, and that intrinsic brightness isn’t the same as observed — or apparent — brightness.
The farther away an object is, the less bright it appears. But this isn’t just some general rule we apply, there’s a quantitative relationship that allows us to determine how bright-or-faint an object appears based on its distance. Put simply, brightness falls off as the inverse of the distance squared, or b ~ 1/r².
Place an object twice as far away, and it will appear one-fourth as bright. Place it ten times as distant, and it appears just one-hundredth as bright. And place it a thousand times as far from you as it started, and it will appear just one-millionth as bright as it was initially.
For any object that emits its own light, these two factors determine an object’s apparent brightness: the intrinsic brightness and the distance it is from the observer.
These two factors are, arguably, the two biggest ones to consider when we determine what type of telescope to build. Want to see something fainter? You’ll need to collect more light, which either means building a bigger telescope or observing the same portion of the sky for longer.
If money and engineering were no consideration, you’d opt for the bigger telescope every time. Build your telescope twice as large, and you not only gather four times as much light, but you double your resolution. To gather four times as much light by observing longer, you need to spend four times the amount of time, and gain no such advantage in resolution.
The biggest telescopes we have are capable of viewing objects to the greatest resolution possible, and resolving their details in the shortest possible time.
There’s also the consideration of field-of-view. What’s your goal? Is it to see the faintest object possible? Or is it to view the greatest possible amount of the Universe?
There’s a trade-off to make. Your telescope can gather a certain amount of light, and it can either do that by viewing a small region to great precision, or a large region to lesser precision. Just as a microscope can double its magnification by halving the diameter of its field-of-view, a telescope can see deeper into a region of the Universe by narrowing its field-of-view.
Different telescopes are optimized for different purposes. The trade-off is severe, however. If we want to go as deep as possible, we can only do it in one small region of the sky.
This is the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field. A tiny region of space was imaged, in a variety of wavelengths, for a total of 23 days. The amount of information that was revealed is breathtaking: we found 5,500 galaxies in this small patch of sky. The faintest objects in this patch are literally a factor of 10,000,000,000 (ten billion) times fainter than what you can see at the limit of your naked eye.
Due to its large-diameter mirror, its observations at a variety of wavelengths, its location in space, as well as its high magnification and small field-of-view, Hubble can reveal the faintest galaxies ever discovered. But there’s a cost: this image, which took 23 days of data to create, spans only 1/32,000,000th of the sky.
On the other hand, you can take a view like this. This was created with the Pan-STARRS telescope, which views the entire visible sky multiple times every night from its location here on Earth. It’s comparable in size to the Hubble Space Telescope, but it’s optimized for wide-field imaging, choosing to value sky-coverage over magnification.
As a result, it can reveal objects located practically anywhere on the sky; only the extreme south pole region is cut off due to the telescope’s location in the northern hemisphere. Pan-STARRS, which stands for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, grabs some 75% of the sky, and is great for detecting changes between points of light. It can find comets, asteroids, Kuiper belt objects and more like no other. But it can only find objects that are thousands of times brighter than the faintest ones Hubble can detect.
As much as we’d like to, we cannot simply survey the entire outer Solar System at the required magnitude to discover everything that’s out there. A super-deep, super-faint, all-sky survey will likely never be a possibility due to technological limitations; we can go faint-and-narrow or bright-and-wide, but not both, simultaneously.
There’s also one more limiting factor that goes way back to the beginning: these objects are only reflecting sunlight. If you look to the outer Solar System at two identical objects, but one’s twice as distant as the other, it’s actually only one-sixteenth as bright. This is because by time the sunlight hits the farther object, it’s only one-quarter as bright, but then that reflected light has to travel double the distance back to our eyes, making the overall apparent brightness fall off as b~ 1/r⁴. Even if we had a Jupiter-sized world located in the Oort Cloud, we wouldn’t have found it yet.
We have plenty of telescopes capable of seeing incredibly faint objects, but we need to know where to point them. We have plenty of telescopes capable of surveying huge areas of the sky, but they can only see the brighter objects; faint ones are out of reach. And for objects in our own Solar System, because they reflect sunlight rather than emit their own, self-generated light, they cannot be seen by any modern telescope if they’re located beyond a certain distance.
As with all things, the scanning we can do is powerful, interesting, and educational. It has revealed thousands upon thousands of objects within our own Solar System, from planets to moons to asteroids to Kuiper belt objects and more. But as telescope technology and sky coverage improve, we only see smaller, fainter, and more distant objects. We push the limits, but we never remove them. The science of astronomy is a story of receding horizons. But no matter how deep we go, there will always be a limit to what we can observe.

What’s My Fort White Pedestrian Accident Case Worth?
It’s hard to say what your pedestrian accident case is worth without knowing more about your specific situation. Every case is unique, which is why there’s no standard payout or settlement for injured pedestrians.
What will be important are the details that comprise your story:
- What types of injuries did you suffer when you were struck by the vehicle?
- Are your injuries serious, as defined by Florida state law?
- Has the pedestrian accident impaired your ability to work and earn a living?
- How old were you at the time of the accident?

- What impact has the accident had on your emotional health and well-being?
You can generally expect a higher payout when the consequences of your pedestrian accident are life-changing. The higher your related costs (medical bills, lost wages) and the more your life is adversely impacted by the accident, the more money you’ll generally be entitled to recover through a claim or lawsuit.
Allen Law Firm, P.A., is here to help you make the most of your fight for compensation. Call our law office serving Fort White to learn more about how we can help you maximize your recovery.

Unfortunately, despite the pedestrian infrastructure, several pedestrians are still injured in Fort White car accidents every year.
Some of the most common causes of these car-and-pedestrian accidents include:
- Distracted driving
- Drunk driving
- Drugged driving
- Fatigued driving
- Failing to yield the right of way
- Driver or pedestrian unfamiliarity with local laws and customs
- Illegal turns
- Rolling stops
There are times when vehicle defects, dangerous road designs and defects, inclement weather, and limited visibility can also set the stage for pedestrian accidents.

Can I Recover Compensation If I’m Getting Blamed For My Florida Pedestrian Accident?
Yes, as long as you do not share more than 50 percent of the blame for your pedestrian accident.
Under Florida’s modified comparative negligence statute, there is a strict 51 percent bar to recovery. If you’re mostly to blame, you cannot recover compensation. If you’re partly to blame, you can recover a portion of your damages.
Damages are reduced in direct proportion to fault. If you’re 10 percent to blame, your damages will be reduced by 10 percent.

How Long Do I Have To File a Pedestrian Accident Lawsuit in Florida?
Florida has a two-year statute of limitations that applies to the majority of pedestrian accident lawsuits.
This time limit applies to cases involving personal injury and wrongful death.
You must file your claim before the deadline expires if you want to recover compensation. When the second anniversary of your pedestrian accident rolls around, you will have lost the right to initiate a legal claim for damages.
Contacting a Fort White personal injury lawyer as soon as you can after an accident is the best way to protect your rights and determine the appropriate deadline for your case.

"Kissing is often seen as a way to express love, affection, and intimacy towards someone. It can strengthen emotional bonds and create a sense of connection between individuals.
Kissing can convey messages and emotions that words may not be able to express. It can communicate desire, passion, and attraction between partners.
Kissing can be pleasurable and can stimulate the release of various hormones and neurotransmitters, such as oxytocin and dopamine, which can create feelings of pleasure and arousal.
Kissing can help strengthen social bonds and create a sense of belonging within a relationship or community. It can also be a way to establish trust and build intimacy.
Some researchers suggest that kissing may have evolved as a way to assess potential mates and their genetic compatibility. It is believed that kissing allows individuals to exchange chemical signals through taste and smell, which can provide information about a person's health and reproductive fitness.
It's important to note that the reasons for kissing can vary between individuals and cultures, and not everyone may engage in kissing for the same reasons.

"TikTok has taken the social media world by storm and has become a popular platform for influencers and brands to share their content and reach a wider audience. With its unique algorithms and features, TikTok has become a hub for entertainment, education, and inspiration. However, with millions of users on the platform, it can be challenging to stand out and build a loyal following.Are you a TikTok creator struggling to increase your followers? Although Tiktok followers is a relatively new social media platform, it has grown exponentially over the past few years. As of 2021, TikTok boasts of about 1 billion active users.

Do not fret!In this article, we will share some tips and strategies that can help increase your TikTok followers and grow your presence on the platform.
- Find your niche and create valuable content
The first step to growing your TikTok following is to find your niche and create content that is unique and valuable.

"I've aligned reads onto an haploid reference genome. I'd like to have a consensus sequence of all my aligned reads that doesn't take into account the reference genome I used (i.e. I just want the nucleotides from my reads at each base (taking into account frequency and quality) but if there is no read a one position I rather have N/? than the reference nucleotide. Is there a way to do this ? Thanks
vSNP outputs a VCF file that includes positions with no coverage, represented as ""N"". Then there is a tool to merge a VCF file into the FASTA reference vsnp_merge_vcf_into_fasta.py
. It will merge those ""N"" regions into the FASTA reference. There are options for considering frequency and quality.
It's limited to just SNPs and those regions along the reference with no coverage. It does not merge small indels or unmapped reads. Pilon is a better tool for applying indels, but I'm not aware of it letting regions with no coverage be represented as ""N"".
vSNP_step1.py -r1 *_R1*fastq.gz -r2 *_R2*fastq.gz -r ref.fasta
output to merge into FASTA
vsnp_merge_vcf_into_fasta.py -f ref.fasta -v *_zc.vcf
The difference here is that you want to go through and replace low coverage (maybe zero-coverage?) positions with Ns rather than using the reference. You can likely accomplish this using samtools depth
to measure coverage and then writing a script that will go through each position in your reference, check its coverage, and string-replace with an N. Probably a bash one-liner could do this if someone very devoted to bash one-liners came up with one (I don't care for them, but other people are more creative than I). Very quick and dirty pseudocode might look like this:
### Someone could come up with something better if they spent >3min on it.
### should be easy to get it working if you use biopython
# read_and_preprocess() stands for whatever you need to do to get data in the right shape
coverage_data = read_and_preprocess('samtools_coverage.txt')
# reference_with_variants.fasta comes from the solution linked above
reference_fasta = read_and_preprocess('reference_with_variants.fasta')
threshold = 0
fasta_string = ''
for position in reference_fasta:
if coverage_data[position] <= threshold:
fasta_string += ""N""
fasta_string += reference_fasta[position]
# nonexistent fn that writes a fasta.
I am a little skeptical of this approach because it seems like if you do not trust the reference sequence to stand in for zero-coverage areas, then you probably shouldn't trust it to align to and call variants against. Read mapping can be a rather noisy process, especially when you are using a more distantly related reference. I think this is related to the @swbarnes2 comment.
I would suggest instead indicating the regions of low/zero coverage by putting them in lowercase acgt
with your covered regions uppercase ACGT
, which preserves the coverage information that you care about but still allows you access to the reference information. It's not a perfect solution, but I think it makes the most out of the marginal data you're working with, and it is trivial to change the above example code to do it.

"You want to be successful. You want to rake in that moolah, break the glass ceiling and shatter the stereotypes. You want nothing but the best for yourself and your family. And you are willing to put in whatever it takes to reach there. But are you taking care of that one thing that’s going to help you achieve those dreams? We’re talking about YOU.
We can’t rave enough about self-care and how essential it is to find balance in your busy lives. They don’t call life a “balancing act” for no reason, do they? Staying in balance is the difference between moving through life and living it to the fullest. It’s when you get through the toughest of days without feeling like a mess (singing “Don’t cha wish your girlfriend was calm like me?”).
Don’t we all wish to experience that kind of calmness? Here are some tips that can help get your life back into balance.
- STOP and disconnect
Is there a better way to start?! Stop… take a deep breath and take a moment to realize and analyze what you are doing, how you are spending your day, and are you doing it all a little too much. Accept the fact that you’ve only got so much time and energy to give. You cannot be perfect in all you do all the time; you cannot be available for everyone every time, and that is entirely OK.
- Find a purpose
Prioritize what means the most to you. And let only those things or people affect you. Schedule your day to align with that purpose and focus on activities that make you feel productive and not exhausted. It’s important to remember that purpose can keep changing depending on your phase of life. Still, it’s also essential to know that you can find a purpose for every stage of your life, one that’s most relevant to where you’re at physically and mentally.
We can’t turn a blind eye to the fact that a day isn’t just one activity. Several responsibilities, activities and challenges make up our day and night. Instead of spending time fretting and panicking over how much you’ve got to go, spend that time prioritizing items in your “to-do” list. Knowing what your day looks like is one thing, but comprehending how you’re going to spend it will make life so much easier. Oh, and did we mention, “Me” should always top that list, followed by a “Say NO to everything that isn’t adding value to my life (Be brutal).”
- Make time for yourself.
Before you get ready to take on the world, spend some time to take care of yourself. TBH, as much time as you can. Indulge in practicing your idea of self-care and self-love. Unless you’re happy with yourself, you cannot be satisfied with what you do. Love yourself, your body, your existence, your life and find ways to pamper yourself in ways you’d do to a loved one. Follow groups, pages, and communities that inspire and encourage you to do the same.
Have fun. Spend time doing things that aren’t work-related or do not churn out a quantitative result. Well, unless you’re counting those serotonin levels. Do nothing at all, if that’s what you want. Let loose and let go. Life isn’t about your 9-5 job. It’s instead everything outside that.
We all know life isn’t a To-Do list that you’ll be able to stick to as planned. There will always be something that brings you off balance. The key is to be cognizant of when that happens and tuning yourself back in control using these steps, again and again, until one day it sticks on as a way of living. You’ve got this!",<urn:uuid:8c74dd24-c823-499c-aa86-f27b628bd1a3>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://birthcontrol.com/blog/5-ways-to-find-balance-life-hacks-for-every-busy-bee/,2024-02-20T21:52:19Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9522050619125366,842,1.7949625253677368,2

FROM £23 PH
At BIT Homecare, we understand that caregiving can be rewarding but also physically and emotionally demanding. In this section, we will explore what Respite Care is, its significance, and how it can provide caregivers with the break they deserve.
What is Respite Care?

- Home-Based or Facility-Based: Respite Care can be provided in the comfort of the individual’s home or in a specialised care facility, depending on the caregiver’s preferences and the care recipient’s needs..
- Skilled Care: Care is provided by trained and experienced professionals who can meet the specific needs of the individual receiving care. This can include assistance with daily activities, medical care, and companionship.
Benefits of Respite Care:
- Physical and Emotional Renewal: Caregivers can use the break to rest, recharge, and focus on their own physical and emotional well-being, reducing burnout and stress.
- Quality Time: Respite Care allows caregivers to maintain a healthy work-life balance and spend quality time with their loved ones when they return, without the added strain of continuous caregiving responsibilities.
- Peace of Mind: Knowing that their loved one is in capable hands during their absence provides caregivers with peace of mind, reducing worry and anxiety.
- Preventing Caregiver Burnout: Regularly scheduled Respite Care can help prevent caregiver burnout, ensuring that caregivers can provide consistent, high-quality care over the long term.

"Maintaining a beautiful lawn can be a challenge, especially in areas like Chesapeake, VA, where the climate can be quite harsh. However, with the right knowledge and steps, you can achieve a lush and healthy lawn that will be the envy of your neighbors. In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the essential tips and tricks for lawn care in Chesapeake, VA.
1. Soil Preparation: The Foundation of Your Lawn
Creating a healthy lawn starts with proper soil preparation. Conduct a soil test to determine the pH level and nutrient deficiencies. Chesapeake’s soil generally has a pH between 5.5 and 7, which is slightly acidic to neutral. Based on the test results, amend the soil with lime or sulfur to achieve the ideal pH for your grass type.
2. Choosing the Right Grass Type for Chesapeake
Selecting the right grass type is crucial for a thriving lawn in Chesapeake. Some popular warm-season grasses for this region include Bermuda grass, Zoysia grass, and Centipede grass. These grasses are known for their durability and ability to withstand the hot and humid climate of Chesapeake.
3. Proper Mowing Techniques
Mowing is an essential aspect of lawn care. Set your lawnmower blades to the recommended height for your grass type. For most warm-season grasses, a height of 1.5 to 2 inches is ideal. Avoid cutting more than a third of the grass height at once, as it can stress the grass and lead to scalping.
4. Watering Wisely: The Key to a Thriving Lawn
Proper watering is crucial for a lush lawn. Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deeper root growth. Aim for one inch of water per week, including rainwater. Early morning watering is recommended to minimize evaporation. Consider using a sprinkler system or set up a timer to ensure consistent watering.
5. Fertilizing: Nourish Your Lawn
Fertilizing your lawn in Chesapeake is essential to replenish essential nutrients and maintain its health. Apply a slow-release, balanced fertilizer in early spring and again in late summer or early fall. Avoid fertilizing during periods of drought or excessive heat, as it can burn the grass.
6. Controlling Weeds and Pests
Weeds and pests can quickly overtake your lawn if left unchecked. Regularly inspect your lawn for any signs of weeds or pests. Use an appropriate herbicide or pesticide sparingly to control the problem. However, be mindful of local regulations and environmental impact.
7. Aeration: Breathe New Life into Your Lawn
Aeration is the process of creating small holes in your lawn to allow better airflow, water infiltration, and nutrient absorption. Rent a core aerator or hire a professional to aerate your lawn once a year, preferably during the growing season.
8. Reseeding and Overseeding
Over time, your lawn may develop bare or thin patches. Reseeding and overseeding can help fill in these areas and promote a denser lawn. Choose high-quality grass seed that matches your existing grass type. Before reseeding, remove any debris, loosen the soil, and water the area thoroughly.
9. Regular Maintenance and Care
To maintain a healthy lawn, regular maintenance is key. This includes raking leaves, removing debris, and keeping your lawn free from excessive thatch build-up. Regularly sharpen your lawnmower blades for a clean and precise cut.
By following these tips and investing time and effort into your lawn care routine, you can achieve a lush and healthy lawn in Chesapeake, VA. Remember, consistency is key, and with dedication, you will enjoy a beautiful lawn that enhances the curb appeal of your home.",<urn:uuid:586336af-4cef-40a6-8382-b58e41a3b414>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://bjlgiln.info/why-arent-as-bad-as-you-think-10/,2024-02-20T22:47:15Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9271543622016907,775,2.0798003673553467,2
"In recent years, with the rapid development of modern gene sequencing and protein analysis techniques, the amount of digitized biological data has increased rapidly. Given the great complexity of DNA such as the number of up to about 3 billion nucleotides in the DNA of human cells, understanding the mechanism that controls the action of genes will require the assistance of computational algorithms which are capable of running on powerful computer systems. Therefore, bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary research field that is receiving great attention in order to apply information technology to solve important problems in biology, medicine, especially in biology molecular.
Our research group focuses on the study and development of machine learning methods to explore factors affecting transcription, translation as well as post-translational modification of proteins, to determine functions of proteins, and apply to supporting the treatment of human diseases such as cancer as well as reducing and removing the harmful effects of viruses and bacteria to humans.

"What is CBD Oil?
CBD oil or Cannabidiol oil is a non-psychoactive ingredient that comes from the marijuana plant. It CAN'T get you high, but it has some incredible benefits. It has been shown to reduce chronic pain, ease anxiety, help heart health, and even ward off cancer. Not only is it incredible for bodily health, it also promotes hair health. Since it works great on head hair, it also improves the condition of beard hair.
Good beard grooming & beard care have become more popular in recent years, and beards are in style. Some men can have some trouble growing beards because of bad skin, or problematic hair. But these men deserve to grow a full, beautiful beard, with the help of CBD. A bearded gentleman can use this oil to achieve the length, bulk, and luster he’s always wanted. Here are the 4 great benefits of CBD oil on the beard:
1. Promotes Hair Growth
Hair is mostly made of a protein called keratin, which includes the hair of the beard. CBD oil is loaded with a compound called Omega 3’s, Omega 6’s, and Omega 9 fatty acids, which are also called GLA or gamma-linolenic acids. This particular compound adds to the protein content of the hair strand and makes it structurally stronger from the inside.
They also promote blood circulation, which makes for a healthier follicle. Healthy follicles grow longer and stronger hair. Not only can it be used on beards, but it can be used on head hair as well, to prevent hair loss. It is a good idea to begin a CBD regimen as soon as possible, as hair loss usually starts in a man’s early 30s, but can happen sooner. A big, full beard is achievable even if you are losing sod on the fairway (hair on top of your head).
2. Helps Prevent Hair Loss
The protein-building properties of CBD oil and its moisturizing power do wonders for beard hairs already grown outside the follicle. Hair loss on the beard happens a lot because of breakage. Hair strands that are dry and brittle are prone to just snap off like a bit of saltine cracker, preventing you from achieving bulk and length.
The oil makes the strand stronger with moisture and protein, making the hair less prone to breakage. With a good CBD oil, you can reduce the breakage and grow a longer, fuller beard. If you have trouble growing hair on your head because of breakage, the oil will work to stop breakage there too.
3. Moisturizes Hair Strands
Moisture is key to preventing breakage and promoting new growth. CBD is such a powerful moisturizer because it is loaded with vitamin E. Vitamin E is one of the greatest conditioners nature has to offer. It is good for skin, beards, and hair on the head. Not only will moisturizing make your beard stronger, but it will also add a luxurious shine and make your beard softer to the touch.
A long full beard isn’t worth it if the hair is itchy and rough. Not to mention, your significant other will thank you for a soft face full of whiskers. The oil also tames stray hairs and allows for easier styling. If you are a fan of fancy mustache and beard styling, CBD oil will make this much less of a struggle.
4. Moisturizes Skin Below the Beard
The skin under the beard is just as important as the beard hairs themselves. It contains the follicles that grow the hairs, which need to be well-cared for. CBD oil seeps into pores without clogging them, which will promote hair growth. If you have problematic skin, the oil can also help with skin conditions, such as:
- Redness - Dry skin - Itchiness - Acne -Inflammation

"Updated at 4:16 p.m. on 6/9/2007 to include phone call.
Updated at 6:12 p.m. on 6/9/2007 to include video sale.
Well, my wife and her best friend set off for the video store to sell that massive collection of VHS tapes. No word on whether they were able to sell them or how much they got if they did.
They've been gone for a couple of hours now. I know that in addition to the video store visit, they were supposed to be mailing out some things that they had sold via online auctions, and they were talking about going to Target. I've got kid care duty while the young'uns try to nap.
Update: My wife called about 15 minutes ago (4:01 p.m. by the caller ID) to let me know that they still needed to go to Target, so I have no idea what else they've been up to.
Update: My wife and her best friend returned shortly before 5 p.m. They said that the guy at the store was ""very nice"" to them. He gave them $35 for the whole collection.
I speculated that they may not fetched as high a price because of the decline in VHS media. These days, they probably don't move as swiftly as DVDs. The best friend disagreed, saying that the store was selling used tapes at a rate of buy two, get one free at $14.95 a piece.

"At the end of June, AMS Master students graduate and at the ceremony we award an inspiring example from outside of our school with an Honorary Master.
In 2016, this honor was granted to Vic Swerts and AMS defined his career using the '5 attitudes'. Jan Jacobs, Master in Public Management graduate, was there and now reflects using these 5 concepts. Jan is the general director of Iona vzw and works as a coach on the side. On his website you can read various articles on making you dreams come true.
After two years of intensive studying, I was awarded my Master’s degree at the 2016 Antwerp Management School Executive Masters’ Graduation Ceremony. That had long been an ambitious dream of mine. Vic Swerts gave a keynote on how he realized his own dream, and received an Honorary Master in Innovation and Entrepreneurship for his 50-year career.
Successfully realizing your goals
In his keynote, Baron Vic Swerts explained that he once started a business out of necessity – to make a living. He wanted to earn money to start a family, and to subsequently create some kind of prosperity for himself. That turned out somewhat differently: Soudal is a producer of building specialties, which has become a global player in sealants, polyurethane foam, and glues. The company employs over 2100 people and has an annual turnover of over more than half a million euros. A major corporation, in other words. Even though he is now 76 years old, Swerts doesn’t think about giving up. He only recently signed a contract for another 20 years, as he explained laughing. However, he knows the laws of successfully realizing your goals better than anyone.
And it is very true. If, 10 years ago, you would have told me that I would have a family with three children and be the head of a wonderful enterprise with about 100 employees, I would have a thriving practice, I would have written a book, I would have been awarded a master’s degree in public management with honours, I would have run a marathon, … then I probably would have said that you’re crazy. But the reality is (to my own amazement) that, since then, I have reached it all. That is something I’m very proud of, and so grateful for.
These were all dreams I once had, for me as well. Experience taught me that every result was once a dream, and the road to that dream consists of a few important steps.
Every successful result starts with a wish, a desire, a dream. The starting point is knowing what you want, and being honest about it (with yourself, but with others as well). To get in touch with your wishes and your desires, it is important to make room for them. Busy people who constantly hurry from one thing to another are usually not in contact with what they truly want. Or they’re too fully engaged with what other people ask of them or expect from them. Making a “Bucket List” and a “Fuck-it List” is already a good place to start.
If you just dream, and you don’t do, nothing will happen. The next step is figuring out the smartest way possible to realize your dream. You’re probably standing at the end of a long line, so how have the people who preceded you tackled this issue? If you want to run a marathon, for example, the internet offers you many tips and tricks regarding training, food and drink in order for you to be able to run your very first marathon. If you want to level up, then a coach will definitely be a good idea. So, how are you going to realize your dream?
Every single person who decides to undertake something will feel conflicted within themselves, since making a dream come true also implies leaving your comfort zone and doing things that may have seemed to be impossible at first (otherwise, it wouldn’t have been a dream in the first place). But this cannot be taken for granted, because we feel most comfortable within our comfort zone. Consequently, we always head back to what we already know, and things that feel familiar. That’s why daring is certainly an important step in the growth process and in the realization of your dream.
Without the doing, the dream will only be an objective for the rest of your life. It’s quite simple: no action, no results. You have to start somewhere and work for your dream to come true, because that doesn’t just happen all by itself (unless you believe in fairy tales). Moreover, others aren’t waiting for your dream to become reality, so others aren’t going to help you. In fact, others are often a hindrance for your dream. So, do you want your dream to become an objective and a successful result? Then start doing!
Every success consists of 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. Willpower and decisiveness are key factors. Everyone will sometimes reach a situation where it’s no longer any use, it starting to get too heavy, and you even thinking of giving up. You wonder why you should even try to continue. For me personally, that situation was the first marathon I had ever run. After the 32nd kilometre it started wearing me down and every cell in my body thought about giving up. However, I persevered and now that I look back on it, I cannot believe that I had ever thought of giving up. Giving up is not an option. Unless, of course, persevering is harmful to either you or others.
Baron Vic Swerts listed another extra attitude, ‘gratitude’. On the one hand, he wanted to express his gratitude for the recognition he bestowed. On the other hand, gratitude is in itself an important step (or “law”) for successful people: being grateful for everything that crosses your path, positive thinking and serving a higher purpose; being grateful for the people who surround you, believe in your, and support you. Honestly, my successes wouldn’t even exist without all the beautiful people who surround me.

"Total construction activity in Australia has struggled since 2017. Forecasters predict that most of the market will remain flat or post small gains in the years ahead. Still, there are a number of bright spots on the horizon for the construction industry in the country. These are the top findings of an August 2019 report on the country’s construction market from industry association Master Builders Australia.
Here are seven other findings from the report.
Civil projects will lead the way
The civil construction sector is expected to be “the biggest winner” over the next several years, according to the Master Builders report, thanks largely to the ramping up of government-led transport infrastructure projects. Forecasters predict the best bets coming in civil are in oil and gas, rail construction and roads, while electric, recreation and telecommunications appear “to have peaked and are beginning to contract,” the report said.
Residential growth is still struggling
Due to a raft of circumstances such as lower birth rates, declining migration and an overbuilding of housing before 2017, residential growth has flattened in Australia and is expected to decline in the coming years, the report said. Expert estimates put residential projects at about 168,000 for 2020, which is 28% lower than the peak in 2017.
Commercial growth will struggle, but not in every sector
Commercial growth in the Australian construction market has been a “star performer” over the last couple of years and is forecasted to touch new highs in 2020, according to the Master Builders report. However, such above-average growth is expected to fall back to normal levels in the years ahead, the report said. Office buildings, education and accommodations will contract significantly, and although transportation, health and retail have much more favorable projections, they aren’t enough to overcome the general slowdown. Expect that the drop in commercial growth will also lead to more spaces originally designed for offices to transition to other uses, as people continue to switch to off-site or shared workspaces.
Fewer new homes, but more renovations
If you’re in the Australian home-renovation business, there’s good news—the ultra-low interest rates for loans are expected to help many Australians finally open up their floor plans or redo their kitchens. This is particularly true for detached houses built in the late 1980s.
Major construction firms are increasingly ‘green’
The largest construction firms in Australia—those handling the majority of the country’s big projects—are “greening” their practices and approaches. For example, CPB Contractors, Australia’s largest construction company, has made environmental and sustainable solutions part of its approach to every project. Lendlease, the multinational Australian builder and property manager, has been recognized five years in a row by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) as the world’s most sustainable property fund. Investors and builders in Australia and around the world are choosing more sustainable practices; small- to medium-sized builders might benefit by following their lead.
Modular and prefab will increase market share
Most Western countries like Australia rely on traditional stick build methods and consider modular or prefabricated construction cheap or tasteless. Asian and Nordic countries, however, have long made prefabricated elements and even entire homes a significant part of their market. In recent years, prefabricated and modular homes have grown more popular in Western countries for their cost savings and diminished environmental impact. And while the market for prefabs is only about 3.5% in Australia, that is expected to double in the coming years as quality and design improves.
Technology is speeding up the business
It might feel like construction sites are increasingly out of science fiction, with GPS-enabled equipment, wearable technologies, drones and digital documents such as blueprints and checklists. The result of this is that work happens faster, with better organization and with much tighter supply lines and schedules. Contractors will be well served to implement new technologies to keep their competitive edge—or at least understand and have a flexible attitude toward technology as the larger firms lead the way.",<urn:uuid:980d3eb3-74ff-42fe-95f2-1d772aa2ef89>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://blog.bluebeam.com/australian-construction-market-trends/,2024-02-20T23:25:30Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9591420888900757,846,1.7394134998321533,2
"If you have set up Steam “Family Library Sharing” in Ubuntu (Or other.) Linux (Perhaps following https://blog.budhajeewa.com/make-steam-family-library-sharing-effective-in-ubuntu-linux/.), you will notice that Windows games running with Steam Proton are not working when the secondary user (The one who is borrowing the games.) is trying to play them.
To fix this, log in to the secondary user’s Ubuntu account, and exit Steam completely (By clicking on the Steam icon in the notification area and selecting “Exit Steam”) and launch Steam again through a terminal.
This will allows us to see a bunch of output emitted from the running Steam application.
Once you are in Steam application, navigate to the game that doesn’t work, and click on “Play”. Now keep an eye on the messages that pop-up in the terminal. When the game crashes, you might see a message like this:
wineserver: /share/SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/XXXXXXX/pfx is not owned by you wine: '/share/SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/XXXXXXXpfx' is not owned by you
XXXXXXX would be a random number. Be sure that use the exact path that you get.
This is Steam complaining that the current Ubuntu user doesn’t have access to the above directory path. That is because it is owned by the user who installed the game. To let the secondary user play the game, we have to change the ownership of that directory to the secondary user.
sudo chown -R <secondary-user-name> /share/SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/XXXXXXX/pfx
Be sure to replace “<secondary-user-name>” and “XXXXXXX” as appropriate when you issue this command.
Note that this will make the original user unable to play the game, now that we’ve changed the ownership. When the original user wants to play, change the ownership again following the same steps.
This is not ideal, but it gets the work done until this issue is eventually fixed.",<urn:uuid:411dcaf7-6b93-491d-839b-eadf22e59f88>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://blog.budhajeewa.com/fix-steam-proton-windows-games-not-running-when-accessed-through-family-library-sharing-in-ubuntu-linux/,2024-02-20T22:28:45Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9405309557914734,464,1.8757963180541992,2

"It’s official: schools in NSW, QLD and across the country will begin reopening from next week. While this comes as great news for some parents, many will be concerned about the risk of their children contracting coronavirus and potentially spreading it to more vulnerable people, such as grandparents. It’s undoubtedly a tough decision to send kids back to school, but with the right cleaning practices put in place, the risk can be reduced.
Not many people would give much thought to their garbage chute; that vertical pathway that guides your garbage to its collection area at the street level or basement. There is one built on every high rise building floor just so you can throw your rubbish away at ease without having to make the journey downstairs.
I would like to take a moment to pause and convey my sincere thanks to the amazing work being done by the various Challenger teams to ensure the safety of the community. I feel privileged to work alongside this remarkable group of people, who have dedicated themselves to this business and its ongoing journey through what has been an extremely turbulent time.
Challenger is here to help and we are confident we can full-fill your needs. Whether you are just looking for a simple 2 hour weekly clean for your office or if you are looking for a more extensive sanitisation service with a team of staff, we can take care of it for you, so you can focus on your business practices.
As the world tries to make sense of the coronavirus crisis, it is clear that the elderly are especially at risk and in need of extra precautions to protect their health. Aged care facilities have a duty of care to ensure that the patient care environment within their facility is maintained to a very high standard of absolute hygiene and cleanliness, in order to meet with and adapt to the new needs being enforced to manage and handle such a biohazard.
CoronaVirus (COVID-19) has infected more than 240,000 people around the world and can survive from hours to several days on doorknobs, handrails, elevator buttons and other hard surfaces. By touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes, a person is at high risk of contracting CoronaVirus.
The choice to outsource services within your business can be a complex one and requires a thorough due diligence process. Remember you are entrusting another business to provide not just operational support but the delivery of the entire business process. Whether it be Information Technology, Human Resources, Facilities Management or Finance, there are some obvious points to consider and some less recognisable areas which require your attention.
International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) is a global international standard for regulatory compliance across a range of business fields. The most common is ISO 9001 for quality management standards. Companies with ISO Certification, like Challenger®️, are regularly audited by independent accreditation organisations and issued with improvement notices if required, together with updated re-certification. ISO Certification is the gold standard in terms of measuring a service provider’s processes, systems and adherence to the standards.
Have you ever wondered what is important to you in terms of cleaning? Do you focus on Cost, Compliance or Quality more? Do you lean toward two or prefer all three areas equally for a Balanced approach? Take the test and we can shed some light on it for you.",<urn:uuid:c30b2277-9319-416a-a52c-d4567dc2de1e>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://blog.csgroup.com.au/tag/outsourced-cleaning-services,2024-02-20T23:09:26Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.963333249092102,694,1.2481439113616943,1
"Minimalist design can be gorgeous in the right setting, but as far as we're concerned, bolder is better. We love vibrant looks that make an instant statement while remaining as sophisticated as possible. Hence, our appreciation for the recent resurgence of exotic stone, which is back with a vengeance.
Today's most impressive stone trends incorporate a variety of bold elements without losing their elegant underpinning. We are especially enthusiastic about the following stone trends:
Rich colors form the basis of today's most beautiful stonework. While we've observed a variety of bright hues in the last several months, the most notable include shades of blue, pink, and green. These deep shades are often tempered by an infusion of neutrals, which make them easier to integrate into a variety of settings.
Artistic Tile has clearly mastered the art of incorporating today's most stunning colors into elegant tiles. The designer's Lilac look, for example, draws on the regal beauty of plum to infuse stone with an instant sense of personality. Available in a variety of formats (including a distinctive honed hexagon mosaic), this stone will quickly make an impression while still maintaining the crisp and clean look that has proven so popular over the past several years.
Just as gorgeous as Lilac, Artistic Tile's Verde Aurora reveals the ethereal nature of deep green. While this alluring color takes center stage, subtle infusions of other hues can also be seen on closer examination. Understated shades of pink, grey, and yellow are seamlessly incorporated alongside the tile's rich green to grant the impression of the Northern Lights at dawn.
Color is just one of several options for making an impression with exotic stone. Veining can prove just as impactful — and we're pleased to report that it is definitely back in style. It recently made a much-deserved comeback and has been featured in several of the latest trade shows. When incorporated in high-end tile, veining delivers a natural, yet sophisticated look.
The beautiful possibilities offered through veining stand out in Artistic Tile's intricate Cipollino design. This stone was quarried from the Apuan Alps and honed into gorgeous 12"" x 24"" tiles featuring visually impactful swirls that create a sense of movement. Although beautiful in any setting, this take on veining is particularly in keeping with modern bathroom designs, which aim to up the ante with statement walls and luxurious backsplash.
The latest veining looks are that much more impactful when combined with rich colors, as evidenced by the Verde Aurora style highlighted above. Cipollino, although far more subtle, also features unique colors that would not ordinarily be associated with veined marble. In fact, its name hails from the Italian term for ""little onion,"" as its green-beige hue and streaks of grey draw to mind the fine layers of an onion.
At Decorative Materials, we're looking forward to making the most of today's hottest tile trends. We believe that the elevated looks that are currently in style will not only make an impression now, but also in years to come. The right tile can bring the most exotic and elegant visions to life.
Are you excited to incorporate exotic stone in your interior design? We're happy to help. Browse our Product Lookbook or visit one of our showrooms to get a better idea for how today's most vibrant stone looks can make a mark in your favorite space. Otherwise, feel free to contact us online to discuss ideas.",<urn:uuid:97f3ef15-e7f3-4f8b-aea0-c3596b87a5d0>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://blog.decorativematerials.com/resurgence-of-exotic-stone,2024-02-20T22:41:51Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9526918530464172,714,1.2506842613220215,1

"GLENDALE, Ariz. (Feb. 1, 2015) – Making dreams come true for the New England Patriots and their fans, wide receiver Julian Edelman and rookie Malcolm Butler continued a magical tradition Sunday night following the Patriots’ 28-24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks here in Super Bowl XLIX.
Rising from the frenzied, on-field hoopla moments after their team captured the National Football League championship, Edelman and Butler beamed into the cameras and shouted those four words that for decades have become synonymous with Super Bowl victory celebration.
“We’re going to Disneyland!”
Edelman and Butler each contributed huge plays for the Patriots in the final minutes of the game, giving New England its fourth Lombardi Trophy. Edelman caught a touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter to give the Patriots the lead and what turned out to be the winning score. Then, with 20 seconds left in the game and the Seahawks on the verge of scoring, cornerback Butler intercepted a pass on the goal line to seal the victory. Edelman’s touchdown catch was one of his nine receptions in the game, for 109 yards.
The pronouncement by Edelman and Butler, part of the production for one of TV’s most enduring and iconic Super Bowl commercials, was captured within seconds of the final gun. It was the latest episode of the “I’m going to Disneyland” commercial produced over a 28-year span. Fans can see the episode beginning Monday on the Disney Parks Blog.
On Monday, Edelman and Butler are scheduled for a hero’s welcome at Disneyland Park with a cavalcade down Main Street, U.S.A., accompanied by Mickey Mouse and in front of cheering park guests and Patriots fans. Following the cavalcade, the Patriots players are scheduled to conduct media interviews.
The last time two players visited a Disney park after winning the NFL championship was 2009, when Santonio Holmes and Ben Roethlisberger led the Pittsburgh Steelers to victory in Super Bowl XLIII.
The first of the “I’m going to Disneyland” commercials appeared in 1987 and featured New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms following his team’s triumph in Super Bowl XXI. The commercial was regarded as a groundbreaking concept – a produced national commercial involving a current event, airing on major networks hours after the event. Since then, the commercial has created a national catchphrase, shouted by people of all ages following moments of great accomplishment.
This latest installment – the 48th in the long-running series – followed a similar script, airing only hours after the conclusion of Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday.
Edelman and Butler join a star-studded lineup of sports heroes such as Tom Brady, Eli Manning, Emmitt Smith, Michael Jordan, Kurt Warner, Coach Jon Gruden, Joe Montana, John Elway, Jerry Rice, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Doug Williams, Magic Johnson and NHL goalie Patrick Roy who have been featured during the nearly three decades of “I’m going to Disneyland” commercials.",<urn:uuid:3b2cbe40-a284-4602-9855-03ebe3d57742>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://blog.disneygeek.com/2015/02/02/super-bowl-xlix-stars-julian-edelman-and-malcolm-butler-going-to-disneyland-monday-feb-2-disney-news-release/,2024-02-20T22:06:48Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9456799626350403,636,1.202699065208435,1

"How do you come to terms with not being able to do everything, everywhere, all at once?
I enjoy taking photos. I’m fascinated with collecting rocks. I adore making memories with my children. I cherish taking in walks with my wife. And I forever strive to soak in small moments of solitude in the beautiful places I travel to. But how do I figure out which reasonable combination of these things to do at a given time?
As I’ve mentioned in previous posts, one of our family goals this past year (and for next year) is to travel around Michigan. More specifically, travel around Michigan with the intention of walking along the beaches of the Great Lakes to collect various rocks and fossils, a hobby often referred to as rock hounding.
Something I struggle with though, not only during these adventures but other travels as well, is figuring out how to spend my time when we’re out and about. Realistically, I can only do one, maybe two tasks at a time. So, using the aforementioned examples, do I spend the time walking along the beach trying to corral the children while occasionally picking up a rock or two (and having a fear of missing out (FOMO) that I might miss a beautiful agate)? Or do I enjoy the walk with my wife and snap a few photos along the way? Should I be recording video of the kids as they look for rocks worth keeping? Or should I take a still photograph of them instead? Do I use a 35mm film camera or my 120 Contax 645? 50mm or 105mm?
So many decisions, both before and during every single activity. And that’s to say nothing of dealing with the FOMO that making one decision altered what could’ve been the better one after the fact.
I know I’m not the only one to feel this way; my wife expressed feeling the same way during our adventures (we’re both very multifaceted people with more hobbies and interests than is likely reasonable) and I’ve talked with others who feel this way in varying capacities. But it really does wear on me in ways that I don’t often realize until after the fact when I’m in a decompression stage much later on.
I’ve always considered myself to be someone who understands tradeoffs, opportunity costs, and cost-benefit analyses of both business and personal endeavors. But I think I’ve come to terms with the fact that I struggle much more with the latter.
In my work life, I seem to have no problem making a decision amongst seemingly endless possibilities and doing it with little to no second guessing. But that aptitude doesn’t appear to translate well into my personal life. I’m not sure why, and I certainly don’t have an answer, but this post is my “thinking out loud” exercise I hope to be able to reference months or years from know when I eventually make some progress on this matter.",<urn:uuid:caef1660-75fa-4900-87af-394002c49184>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://blog.gannonburgett.com/,2024-02-20T22:41:13Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.966681182384491,623,0.958165168762207,1

"The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandates that all employers who are required to maintain the OSHA 300 Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses post a summary of the previous year’s log between February 1st and April 30th each year, even if no incidents occurred in the preceding calendar year. The summary (OSHA Form 300A) must be certified by a company executive and posted in a conspicuous location where notices to employees are customarily posted.
All employers who had more than ten employees at any point during the last calendar year are covered by this requirement unless they qualify as part of an exempt low-risk industry. A full list of the industries exempt from OSHA routine recordkeeping requirements (including posting Form 300A) can be found in the Guides section of the HR Support Center by searching “partially exempt industries.” It’s called “OSHA Fact Sheet: Reporting and Recordkeeping Rule and Partially Exempt Industries List.”

"Under the present enactment, any credit help suppliers are required to either be licensed entirely or a credit representative of a National Credit License holder. On the off chance that your car finance broker isn’t both of these, you should presumably attempt to discover one that is, as they may not be trading lawfully.
Car Finance Broker
On the off chance that they hold their very own Australian Credit License, they will require to have certain assurances set up for the purchaser, which would incorporate having adequate Professional Indemnity Insurance and to be an individual from an outside questions goals organization, for example, the Financial Ombudsman Services (“FOS”) or the Credit Ombudsman Services Limited (“COSL”)
1. Credit license
It is likewise essential for the broker
or credit to help the supplier to have a Credit License or be a credit
representative. Along these lines, on the off chance that the broker isn’t any
of these, at that point, he’s trading unlawfully, and you should abstain from
enlisting them for the activity.
2. Related with
It is significant to have the option to coexist with your picked broker. On the off chance that you are not comfortable with your broker, your business exchange would end sharp. Your finance broker should be someone you can trust since they’ll dive into the financial circumstance you are in and will know some extremely close to home insights regarding you. If the broker you are considering doesn’t leave a generally excellent impression from the start, you should better look someone else.
Indeed, that is important. Verify whether the broker is prepared to impart all the essential data to you or not. They should furnish you with everything in the composed structure, be it printed or through an email. In any case, on the off chance that they are not prepared to do that, there’s something fishy going on, and you should be careful about that. At the point when you have everything in composed structure, it’s the verification of your dealing and can prove to be useful if you have a contest to deal with by the day’s end. Along these lines, if your broker isn’t conceding to taking things further that way, you should better search for someone else.
4. What number of customers have
If the broker works with just a couple of loan specialists, at that point, it implies you won’t in any way, shape, or form have the best accessible deal available. Specialists with a more fabulous loaning board can regularly give you many diverse car finance alternatives, and you can get the best deal on showcase without a doubt. In specific cases, it truly has a tremendous effect.
5. Physical area
It’s occasionally essential to guarantee
that you’re dealing with someone that exists on the ground. That is basic
stuff. Misrepresentation happens on the web, and there are many such models
accessible also where finance brokers defrauded people searching for car
Finding the best car finance broker out there might be very overwhelming in
some cases; however, it isn’t outlandish in any way. You should remove some

"Have you noticed electric bikes around your neighborhood?
They are growing in popularity all around the country as more and more people embrace 2-wheels and are doing their part to help reduce pollution.
A recent study found that 46% percent of e-bike commute trips replaced automobile commute trips and if 15 percent of car trips were made by e-bike, carbon emissions would drop by 12 percent.
If Congressman Paneta and Congressional Bike Caucus Chairman Earl Blumenauer’s E-Bike Act is signed into law, it will help Americans get up to a $1,500 tax credit when they buy an electric bike.
“E-bikes are not just a fad for a select few, they are a legitimate and practical form of transportation that can help reduce our carbon emissions,” said Congressman Panetta.
Here’s how it will work should it pass through the legislative process:
- Covers 30% of the cost of the electric bicycle, up to a $1,500 credit
- Applies to new electric bicycles that cost less than $8,000
- Is fully refundable, allowing lower-income workers to claim the credit
Support the Act:

"The holidays are knocking at the door with guests not far behind. It’s a joyful but busy season of hosting and gathering. We’ve pulled together three simple DIYs to help you freshen up your home yet leave you ready to relax and enjoy all the moments that matter most.
Work Some Magic in the Dining Room
During the holidays, the dining room can become a cramped and crowded hub for hosting. For a more spacious feel, create the illusion of depth with color. A dark hue like Iron Ore can achieve this while also bringing an elevated look to the space. Paint just an accent wall or cover walls and trim with the same color to soften angles and evoke the impression of expansiveness.
A Little Love for the Trim
Refreshing trim is a simple and often-overlooked way to make an impact with little input of time or cost. To heighten the drama, go for a monochrome look using a moody shade like Mount Etna. Blending the trim, walls, and ceiling brings harmony and creates the impression of open space. Or, to keep things more simple, you could choose a darker contrasting color and paint just the trim to define borders with sharp, bold lines. Make the project even easier and simply touch up the existing color for a fresh, clean look.
Freshen Up the Fireplace
Gather round and nestle in to the cozy vibes with a quick and easy fireplace refresh. This festive focal point provides the perfect backdrop for your holiday gatherings. With a bold neutral like Pewter Green, this DIY can make a big impression year-round. It’s an easy, statement-making update that will grab the notice of family and friends.",<urn:uuid:5b8c836e-fa24-4ee0-bb81-0ecf025a774b>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://blog.sherwin-williams.com/projects/project-inspiration/3-ways-to-get-your-home-holiday-ready/,2024-02-20T21:17:09Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.8939170837402344,353,0.8912750482559204,1
"By Simon Woodhead
I get so tied up in the ‘today’ and the ‘tomorrow’ that I sometimes forget to look in the rear-view mirror. To be honest, when I do it usually makes me cross to see lies and vanity putting fake polish on turds industry-wide. So often technical competence, innovation, and investing in doing things the right way – the way that takes account of the bigger picture – get drowned out by noise. It disgusts and depresses me to the core.
Just lately though, I’m finding that rear-view terrifically amusing, seeing an entire industry flailing around with limited scope for turd-polishing! They can’t market-over a 578x cost increase. They can’t deny the lack of innovation, investment, let alone competence, that necessitates a middle-of-the-day upgrade (which they cock up causing an outage) the day before a change. They can’t deny their sell-side revenue obsession and greed, leaping like lemmings to cobble together some form of passing through surcharges because they have no idea whatsoever what calls cost and are blind to a better way. Put simply, they can’t pretend to care about customers or the ultimate consumer when their true colours are laid so bare.
An early mentor of mine once told me of an exercise where everyone holds a very long rope and blindfolded follows a leader around a yard. The leader changes direction, goes round obstacles, sees things coming. Everyone else gets jerked one direction or the other by the rope, pulled with no notice, stumbling, tripping over things. The further back along the rope they are, the more clueless and pulled about they are, and the further they get flung one way or the other. A tiny change of direction at the front is a massive swing at the back. I look in the mirror and that’s a metaphor for exactly what I see today.
Now this may sound arrogant and won’t win me new friends, hell it’ll probably get me more drunk abuse by those who consider themselves called out, but I (still) really don’t care. We’re here for our customers and the ultimate consumer, not the affection of a charlatan cohort. And don’t think I’m suggesting we’re at the front of the rope either, we’re clearly not this time. Some big companies have apparently moved so quickly a cynic might question whether they started preparing even before Ofcom had the genius idea they supported and we’re all now digesting. Undeniably, we’re pretty close to the front though.
That means some interesting things for those smart enough to choose Simwood:
No origination charges passed through
As origin charging has developed, we’ve maintained that we don’t think it is fair or appropriate to pass through surcharges, let alone join the sleaze by profiting from doing so. Passing them through is almost impossible to do fairly as some level of blending is required. Each operator who has introduced origin charging so far has implemented a unique ladder of not only rates but the origin dial-codes to which they apply, making it rather complex. Some of those passing through have simplified this to a worst case rate ladder, gifting them windfall margin at the expense of their customers and consumers. Ironically, some are lauding their blended rates for being cheaper than someone else’s non-blended rate – don’t fall for it. We don’t want to play that dirty game and have maintained that if we can avoid passing surcharges through, we will.
Thankfully, owing to innovations that whilst 10 or more years old are still unmatched, and different cultural values, we’re able to know exactly what every call costs us in real-time and can act accordingly. Further, Simwood customers did the work to ensure there was no rogue invalid callerID passing through over a year ago.
With all that combined, I’m delighted to confirm today that we will be sticking to our position of no dirty origination charges passed through for the foreseeable future. Simwood customers do not need to worry about rating and routing by origination, just send the traffic to us and relax. Those who exceptionally seek to abuse this however, will know about it nearly as quickly as we do, i.e. realtime!
With origination surcharges coming to fixed lines as well from August 1st, we think this is a massive bonus for Simwood customers!
The most interconnected voice network
Our IP network is large by any competitive standards and it serves us well. However, as a result of BTZero we’re more bilaterally interconnected than any of our peers as far as we can tell. That delivers innumerable benefits in call quality, security and resilience to third party failures. We’re also the only one amongst our perceived peers in the Secret Club. Recall we also passed on new breakouts and new rates for traffic flowing directly to peers and on-net. These remain surcharge free as well!
One of the largest UK wholesale providers
With one exception, most competitors lose wholesale amongst other business activities and dine out on overall revenue. The same revenue cannot be reapportioned indefinitely of course and when those other activities are taken out, not a lot is left for wholesale voice. Others have legacy revenue such as sex-lines which dramatically inflate revenues. Look at wholesale alone though in volume terms and there’s surprising names beneath us.
One rapidly approaching milestone is 1 billion minutes per year at wholesale, whilst we also host number ranges for dramatically more operators than most. That gives us clout dramatically above our size in revenue or profit terms (did I mention we weren’t inflating either passing through origin surcharges?) which is good for Simwood customers. We try to use that shaping the industry the right way, not for us, but for our customers and end-users.
We’re still microscopic in absolute telco terms of course but I expect our scale may come as a surprise to many.
So this is a huge thankyou to customers and colleagues past, present and intended, for trusting, supporting and driving us to here. Others have achieved a lot more in 25 years for sure, but I’m pleased with where we’ve got to with our morals and principles intact.",<urn:uuid:38583e83-e3ce-4b8a-92fc-43fcbcfefeb5>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://blog.simwood.com/2021/07/3-big-wins-for-simwood-customers/,2024-02-20T22:09:32Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9546153545379639,1338,0.8162612915039062,1
"Tango Tournaments: the Ultimate Streamer Showdowns!
Take your streaming battles to the next level by starting tournaments! Massive competitions between dozens of streamers all competiting for big bragging rights and huge prizes!
For over 1000 years, tournaments have been the ultimate test of sport and skill. Today, Tango has brought them back, and they’re bigger and better than ever!Tango has always fostered an atmosphere of healthy competition among their streamers. After all, where else can you go online, link up with a friend, start your stream, and both of you get a chance to earn more money that you would alone?That’s right, only on Tango.Those “battles” between friends are now being taken up a notch. Streamers on Tango now have the chance to compete not just with one person, but with dozens! Like the battles, the winners of the tournaments will be given huge prizes and major bragging rights.
How Do Tournaments Work?
You can either set up a tournament yourself or join someone else’s. Once there are enough people you will be automatically matched up against someone else. Compete against them in timed rounds to see who can earn the most diamonds!

Always bring your best when you come for a tournament! The pressure is on as dozens of streamers will come with their fans to compete. Not only is it a chance for fame and glory, but it’s an opportunity to earn fistfuls of diamonds like never before!
At the end of each tournament, prizes will be given to the first and second place streamer. The first place winner gets an additional 15% to their earnings (5% more than battles, where winners get 10%), while the runner-up gets 10%. Seeing as how the winner in the first Tango cup earned a total of $75,000, that extra 10 or 15 percent is definitely worth fighting for!
The Tango Cups
Tango itself has special tournaments, known as Tango Cups. These are some of the biggest and most intense competitions in the entire streaming world! Broadcasters have the chance to earn major prizes (some competitors walk away hundreds of thousands of dollars!) along with bragging rights and special recognition.

“Handshakes have given way to fist bumps, and sanitizers have found residence with the humble pen in every pocket. And while the masks remain, the eyes still smile. On-ground events are back with a bang!”
After almost 24 months of the world living in sealed pockets, we are now back to stadium cheers with fries and beers! Not only have sport and game opened their doors to crowds, but trade shows and expos have also allowed for a resurgence of businesses too. From the US Open that saw a new champion to Expo 2020 that’s bringing all the world to Dubai; from league football that reminded the world to choose water over carbonated drinks to stampedes at concerts - events and celebrations are back to stay.
A lull in socializing and outdoor life has caused a boom in on-ground events. Excitement levels are through the roof! This is an excellent chance for you to ride the wave, make the most of this renewed vigor and grow your business.
As we move towards a post-pandemic world, let’s talk numbers (of a happier kind). More engagement means more conversion. This guide will tell you how to ace that. But, beginning with the end in mind helps you prepare your plan of action with a much higher probability of success.
There is bound to be a fall in numbers between attraction and conversion. On average, a 3-5% conversion rate is what one can expect. This means, if you reach out to 100 people with your event, you’d be left with 4-5 convertees. On the other hand, unicorns have a conversion rate of 11.45% on average. Those are the levels you want to touch. To do that, you need to seal each stage of your event funnel to hold on to as many leads as you can. This guide will help you work your way through on-ground events and maximize your ROI by doing just that.
On ground events can be one of two kinds:
- A stall/slot at trade shows, exhibitions, summits, conferences, fairs, etc.
- An exclusive event that you conduct
Whether you choose this or that, there are five stages you need to go through for a successful event and increased conversion rates. We’ll walk you through those right here.
Stage One: Plan
Begin your planning with the end in mind. Fix a date for your event, or book one and start planning backward. This will allow enough time for all preparations. The best approach to planning is to visualize the event from the guest’s perspective.
Trade shows, Exhibitions, Summits, Conferences, Fairs
Presented below are some resources for you to ace the planning stage of on-ground events.

2. Best Practices-
- Ask questions and use answers to these questions to shortlist the trade shows or on-ground events you want to take part in:
- Which industry or industries do you usually sell to?
- What’s the company size of your best customers?
- Does your customer base include large enterprise, mid-market, or startup/small business?
- Does your service pair especially well with other technologies?
- Does the on-ground event audience match with your target audience?
- The world is small. Seek experience from people who have already participated in such events. You are sure to get help in making the right decisions based on expected expenses, tips to make the most from the event, a good location to have the event at, and much more.
- Prepare brochures, contact cards, some branded accessories, etc. in advance.
- Plan attraction and engagement strategies in advance:
- Engage local social media influencers in advance to spread the word about your booth. You may wish to provide special treatment to visitors recommended by influencers regarding discounts or gifts.
- Prepare for activities that create a buzz around the show to increase footfall at your booth.
- Buy reward coupons in advance to increase engagement for visitors
- Think of a special offer for visitors to give them a reason to come back to you after the trade show.
- Budgeting - There are often hidden costs associated with participating in such events that fail to make it to your budget, and it’s easy to overshoot. Here’s a non-exhaustive list you must keep in mind:
- Airline transaction fees
- Credit card and processing fee
- Office supplies and shipping charges
- On location transportation
- Parking tickets for VIP guests
- Promotion costs
- When you’re looking to present at an international event, one that is set up in the context of another culture, be mindful of the customs, traditions, and protocols of the places you’re visiting. Work on being fluent in the culture and habits of the people.
The fun in creating your event lies in the field of play available to you. You can stick to a regular format event where you have lunch or tea with some entertainment and sell your services. Or you can choose to get creative and run campaigns that are events in themselves or events that are fiestas! Oh, don’t worry; we’ve got some ideas to get your creative juices flowing.
Creative ideas for on-ground events
Incorporating rewards into your events is a great way to increase participation and possibly conversion. When budgeting for an event that is exclusively yours, you’re not bound to use the allocated budget in a particular manner. For instance, you can choose to run an event that lasts more than just an evening, like eBay’s luxury handbag vending machine.
Nothing shows that you care as personalized gifting does. How about curating personalized gifts for your list of attendees in an invite-only event? Having your customers bring in a plus one to an event and sending them back with a thoughtful, personalized present will make them feel special and make their plus one want to be a part of this exclusive club.
When thinking of fun events, we couldn’t miss telling you about the Amex Gold Card Picnic in the Park. With a curated menu and exclusive access to a luxury picnic in a park, complete with favors and goodies, this campaign sounds like such a hit! Oh, and bonus points to them for collaborating with businesses for food and goodies.
Best practices to plan your event
- Experiment and have fun when coming up with ideas for your events. Remember, the point of an event is to sell. And people are more receptive to buying when they are having fun. So a fun event will mean increased sales.
- Have dedicated teams for dedicated tasks. Assign roles and have people stick to them and see tasks through.
- Planning must be extensive. If you have checklists at every stage of planning an event, it’s unlikely that something will pass you by. We’ve got some for you that you can use as a starting point.
- Budgeting - The event’s purpose and budget will dictate its final format. So understanding the why will help find a way to the how. To do that, you as the marketing team must sit down with the sales team. Set out your event goals and then work the budget.
Here are some considerations you must account for in your budget:
- ✈️ Travel and Accommodation
- 🍔 Food
- 💵 Staff Compensation
- 🏦 Facility Expenses
- ⚙️ Logistics
- 📢 Marketing and PR
Stage Two: Promote
Trade shows, Exhibitions, Summits, Conferences, Fairs
When you rent out a stall in events organized by others, you can cut down on your marketing budget. The event organizer is going to do its bit to publicize the event, and this in itself will generate a decent amount of footfall for you. So here, you must shift your focus to promoting your event to a targeted audience to maximize conversions. To do this, grab sponsorship and advertising opportunities that organizers may provide.
- Reach out to your existing customers through social media and emails. If you have a newsletter, run the event as an exclusive for subscribers. For example, Charles & Keith, Singapore, conducted an exclusive event at their store with a local celebrity artist to launch a collaborative collection. Why would a customer want to miss out on being part of an all-exclusive event?
- Encourage your existing customers to bring people along. Incentivize every interested attendee they bring along with a discount coupon or a special offer.
- Get creative with how you use social media. Engage with your audience in every way possible. For example, create a catchy hashtag on social media and run an online giveaway encouraging people to use the hashtag and share details of the event. Encourage participants to post content using the event hashtag by running a reward campaign around it. Additionally, leverage hashtag analytics to track engagement and reach, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of your campaign. Use these metrics to refine your strategy, tailoring content to resonate more deeply with your audience and amplify your social media presence.
Multi-channel marketing is your best friend when you’re promoting your event. Use a bunch of marketing channels to spread the word about your event. Here are some ideas for you to draw inspiration from:
1. Have a website? Create a landing page dedicated specifically to the event, drive traffic to it through:
- pay-per-click campaigns,
- social media,
- a hello bar on the website
An exclusive event page shall be an excellent way to deliver event details. Using it well - having a fun UI, engaging the audience, giving them a taste of the event, why they should be there, what they can learn, and win - can skyrocket your events’ attendance.
Pro tip: Capture leads through your landing page by offering exclusive rewards and offers.
2. Use emails as one more effective channel:
- Send out a fun email with a catchy subject line
- Add in event details - location, time, other logistic details
- Allow your readers to add the event to their calendars with a CTA button
When you send out emails, the tone must be conversational. Talk TO people instead of talking AT them. No one wants to read another email that sounds like it’s come from work. Make the emails you send out fun, warm, and friendly. Not only is the likelihood of them being read through higher, but they also have a higher recall value.
3.Use listing websites:
- There are some great event calendar websites available. Check out Eventbrite. Look to have your event listed there.
- Use local guide sites to have events listed. Sites like Yelp could give you great reach.
- Use Facebook Events and LinkedIn Events to list.
Use Rewards To Attract More Attendees to Your Events
- Announce that every attendee who brings a plus one who converts will get a special discount or offer on your services. So make it a good one!
- Encourage attendance in groups if it’s an event that is not planned around food (else you’ll only be increasing your costs), and maybe you can have a giveaway around the best-dressed group in theme at the event
- Have a high ticket raffle and a luxury product for the winner
- Announce an open mic at your event and encourage participation with a prize for the winner
- Have small contests with not too expensive but thoughtful giveaways - like tongue-twisters or the attendee who creates a catchy tag line for your business or the attendee carrying an outdated currency note. These little things will have your attendees leave feeling excited, and these will be more likely to have a continued association with you
- Offer specials for liking your social media pages or spreading a word about your product on social media
Stage Three: Engage
To keep your audience engaged, focus on creating an experience for the participant, which then, in turn, evokes an emotion or reaction that is memorable for them. This emotion and memory become an association with your brand, a feel-good factor that increases the chances of a user becoming a loyal customer. 70% of users become regular customers after an event that gave them an experience.
Whether you’re part of a trade show or are hosting your event, the things in your D-Day checklist will look pretty much the same. Here’s a starter for you
The final checklist
- Confirm 📰 media attendance
- Ensure all 🪧 signage is in place — wherever needed, and that it’s visible and not hidden by other signage or obstacles
- Ensure registration and media tables are prepared and stocked with necessary items 🖋 📝 ✏️(such as blank name badges, paper, pens, tape, stapler, etc.)
- Ensure that there’s enough 🍔 🍱 food and 💦 water for you and your team. You need to be well fed and well hydrated to last the day!
- Ensure all 🎁 rewards, giveaways, promotional material, etc. are in good shape and on-site
- Ensure all your 💻 tech equipment is set up and working correctly. If you’re carrying 💡 lights for your booth, check them to ensure they’re all bright and sparkly
- Ensure everyone on the floor is healthy, fully equipped for the day, and has clear instructions and directions for the day. In case you’re expecting VIP as guests, have someone assigned explicitly with their phone numbers, 🔑 keys, 🅿️ extra parking permits, and seating charts for them
- Check-in with your 👩🏻💻 team heads to ensure that everything is on track
- Check-in with 🧑🍳 catering and any 💰 sponsor teams that are attending
Trade shows, Exhibitions, Summits, Conferences, Fairs
In a trade show, you are one stall in many. You need to find a way to stand out and shine. What can you do to make your booth be the one everyone wants to come to? Here are some actionable tips:
- Use the attendees at the event to publicize you. Have brightly colored cloth bags made with your business name and logo and give them out. You know everyone’s going to have goodies being given out. How are your attendees going to carry them around? This is not only thoughtful but smart too!
- Set up an old-school game at your stall. Something big and bright. Maybe a wheel of fortune?
- Collaborate with other vendors at the fair and work out a mutually beneficial arrangement where you direct attendees to each other’s booths.
- Have a caricature artist come in or a lettering artist who can personalize favors you may be handing out at your booth.
The objective of an event is to book a meeting or a demo. Every conversation you have should take you a step closer to that goal. Your event strategy may change whether you’re walking the floor or have a booth, but the goal is the same.
- Move around and motivate attendees to visit your booth or book a meeting. When planning your event, set a concrete goal of a certain number of attendees to engage or a target number of warm leads to generate and stay focused on meeting it. If you do have the option of walking the room, ensure that you know of the layout of the room beforehand so you can make the most of it.
- Ensure that whoever is staffing the booth has a list of your prioritized accounts and your target audience. Check to see if people approaching your booth are from companies on your list. If someone ticks off all boxes on your target audience checklist, establish an instant connection and fix a meeting on the spot.
The goal at an on-ground event is to get as much traffic to your booth as possible. The higher your footfall, the higher the chance of conversions. Footfall converts cold leads to warm leads. Rewards and giveaways can help you make those leads warmer.
Memories and how you leave people feeling are things your guests will carry back with them, whether or not anything else goes home. So creating an event that is exclusively yours gives you the advantage of being able to do what you want with it and create memorable experiences for your guests.
Use Rewards to Maximize Engagement at Your Event
Anything worth doing is worth doing well. So the best rewards are those that tie into your message and serve a purpose. And of course, when they are things people WANT.
Actions Users can Take for Rewards
Here are some ideas to get you thinking on how to encourage participation by offering rewards
- Social Media Posts: Get attendees to promote your sales by using your event hashtag on a social media post while at your booth. Reward them in exchange for their post.
- Newsletter Sign Up: Have attendees sign up for your newsletter at your booth. All you need is a mobile device with an internet connection.
- Sign up for a Product Demo: Reward anyone who signs up for a product demo with you.
Pro Tip: Tie in rewards customers have to come back to you with through these sales promotions. This can be anything from a discount coupon on a future sale, a gift certificate, or maybe even a more significant budget gift for those clients who sign up for your services on the spot!
Choice of Rewards
Picking the right gift won’t only increase your chances of being remembered by your attendees, they’ll also attract a lot more traffic to your booth. Here are a couple of considerations you can use to help you figure out how to pick the right gift
1. Your target demographic
You’ve already done your groundwork and understood your target audience. Now think about what they’d like. Also, look at where your event is happening. For example, is it a rainy city where your attendees could use an umbrella? How about a nicely branded bag that attendees can collect all their freebies from the event and carry home with them?
2. Your Receiver’s Persona
Once you’ve figured out your target demographic, use it to understand your receiver’s persona. Giving out rewards that are persona-specific is a great way to increase the chances of a returning customer. It also becomes more likely for the giftee to claim and use the reward.
3. Get Creative - Reward with an Experience to Remember
Transporting physical gifts to events is an additional cost. You could consider avoiding giving out physical gifts and look at creating fun giveaways instead - a meal at a fancy restaurant, a guided tour of a city that the conference is in, a voucher from a store that’s redeemable.
4. Changing Reward Trends: Don’t miss the bus!
Gifts like trends are constantly changing. USB drives were fantastic half a decade ago. Not so much anymore. I remember going to an event where I came back with a stress ball from a booth. It was light and fun but didn’t make it back home. So what works and what doesn’t? Xoxoday’s reward catalog is ever-evolving with the trendiest rewards with 21000+ global rewards, including countries like the USA, Australia, Singapore, India, Qatar, Japan, and so many more already listed.
Park My Rewards | Case Study
Integration has become a business need today. GetMyParking approached Xoxoday to help with their rewards. Rewards were based on surveys conducted to understand their market (North America). These physical surveys needed to be automated to increase responses.
Xoxoday helped by integrating a rewards program into a platform they already used and sending out person-specific incentives instead of generic rewards to every person who completed the survey. Personalization shows you care, and this is a real-life example. Want more details? Check out the case study here.
Pro Tip: Make sure to collect the email addresses of visitors so you can go from nurturing them and ultimately converting.
Stage Four: Nurture
It’s great if you could convert some customers on the spot at the event. Even if you don’t manage to, it’s alright! Do not underestimate the ones that engaged but didn’t buy. Maybe they need a little bit of a nudge, and the right nurturing can take your association a long way.
Social media today is the loudest way to nurture leads. Use it to your advantage. Have a social media account that is active, interactive, and updated. (Remember, we suggested that you reward people for following your social media pages?)
If you already have a nurturing email sequence in place, nothing like it. Else you can draw inspiration from EmailMastery. Emails are also a great way to push your content to leads and progress them to buying decisions.
Whether you are a participant at a trade fair or running an event of your own, nurturing through emails is the best way to boost your leads. Here is a sequence for nurturing through emails you can follow:
How you time the sending of your emails is super important as well. Bombarding your client with five emails in 24 hours, for example, will make it seem like you’re trying too hard, almost spamming. So timing is everything.
Incentivize Leads with Rewards in Your Nurturing Sequence
Sending out free resources in your emails is a great way to make someone feel like they’re getting an additional freebie along with being a part of an exclusive members club. This process will begin with having a lead submit their email address to you in exchange for a freebie. And that becomes the point you start your nurturing from.
Use a mix of text and emojis in your email subject lines to make them pop in the receiver’s inbox. Use a hook to create interest that forces the receiver into looking inside the email. Here are some smashing subject lines we found that you can draw inspiration from:
- 🥳 Figgers Wireless: "" BIGGEST SALE OF THE YEAR! 50% OFF EVERYTHING!”
- Apartment Therapy: “Why You Should Keep Your Clothes in the Freezer.”
- Dollar Shave Club: “Open up and say wowie zowie!”
- Brooks Brothers: “Up to 40% off trousers & sport coats. It’s a tailor-made sale.”
- Rakuten: “🌹Will you accept this Double Cash Back?”
- Groupon: “Hey... Were You Gonna Delete This?”
- 🔥 Hot freebie alert! 15 free gifts, you pick 5.
- 👗 Free (Cool!) Clothes Alert 👖
- We Saw You Checking Us Out 😏
- 1,750 points for you. Valentine's flowers & more for them
Pro Tip: Trigger buying decisions for leads through rewards, special offers, credits, etc. in your email nurturing sequence
Stage Five: Convert
Adding value to an event is the first step in the right direction towards conversions. Continuing to add value through nurturing emails takes you closer to gaining the next customer in line. An effectively built sales funnel that’s sealed will help you with maximizing warm leads to customers.
- Always follow up 🏃🏻
- It doesn’t 🔚 at the event. You need to remind your leads that you are available to provide services.
- Make special notes of the leads that were warm at the event. Follow up with a 📞 phone call, if you can
- Respond in a ⏰ timely manner
- If you’ve promised someone something at the event, 📨 send it across to them quickly – whether it’s a brochure, a quote for your services or any other commitment you made
- When emails you send out are responded to, reply to them in 🏪 24 hours of receiving them
- Optimize your 👩🏻💻 web experience
- Provide☝🏼one click sign up and sign in options
- 🛠 Update your website regularly
- Ensure your website is 😌 easy to navigate
- Make sure the UI is 🥳 fun and friendly
- Minimize form fields that users need to 📝 fill
- Simplify your 🛒 check out and payment process
- Use 📣 social media
- Connect 🤝 with those who are engaging with social media posts
- Be active in the 💬 comments section - choose to reply to comments, especially those, if any that show your service in poor light
- 💲Invest in a CRM tool
Sum and Summation
When planning an event, don’t be afraid to think out of the box, implement ideas that sound crazy, or run wacky campaigns to create awareness. In a world where you need to be noticed, never be afraid to do what it takes.
Here’s summing up key takeaways, tips, and tricks from what we’ve shared above:
- Use the time before the event to create a buzz. Remind your audience of your existence. Send fun emails, run social media campaigns. Use a hashtag across all social media.
- At an event, sell your brand, your story. Sales of your product or service will follow automatically.
- Create a human connection. Don’t be afraid to step out from behind the counter or outside your booth. The goal is to establish a connection, strike up a conversation and leave the attendee with a little more than what (s)he walked in with.
- Work hard on creating and distributing quality content through your emails and other marketing techniques. The more value you add, the better your chances of conversion.
- Rewards are an almost sure-shot way of retention. Giving out rewards that speak to your audience will make them feel like you care about them. So think long and hard about what you want to give away.
- The rewards you choose to distribute must be in sync with the message your business stands for. Give rewards to be remembered, not junked. Here are some ideas around rewards in the festive season.

"It may seem like a silly statement, but it's one of those things that is all too often forgotten – perhaps the most important thing in creating a television show or film is the ability to tell a good story. Many times storytelling takes a backseat to production styles, editing techniques, or performances. All of those things are, unquestionably, important, but when it comes right down to it, if a creative team can't tell the story there is going to be something fundamentally lacking in whatever gets produced. And, looked at from the opposite side, if one has the ability to tell a great story to tell it, it can be forgiven if some of the other elements are not as sharp as, perhaps they should be. In the end, it is the performances, the editing, the production style, and all the other ancillary things that ought to be put into service to tell the story, not vice versa. Importantly, very importantly, the story itself need not be the greatest, deepest, most profound story ever, it just needs to be well told.
The upcoming DVD release Shaun the Sheep: Back in the Ba-a-ath, produced by Nick Park and Aardman Animation (the folks behind Wallace & Gromit) features storytelling at its finest. The series, which has appeared on the Disney Channel, features brief episodes, each approximately (on average) six to seven minutes in length. Featured in the series is Shaun, his sheep friends, Bitzer the sheepdog, The Farmer, and The Naughty Pigs.
Filmed using the same sort of stop-motion techniques Aardman has used to great success in Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit, and other Aardman work. And, just as in those other Aardman works, there is a sense of wit and cleverness in each of the eight episodes of Shaun the Sheep included on this DVD.
Shaun, for those who don't know, first appeared in the Wallace & Gromit short ""A Close Shave."" He subsequently appeared in Cracking Contraptions before finally being given a chance to shine by himself, and shine he does. Though "" just"" a sheep, Shaun, as with all of Aardman's animals, is highly anthropomorphized. Shaun and the rest of the Flock spend the vast majority of their time trying to outwit The Farmer, Bitzer, and anyone else who might get in their way.
In ""Take Away,"" a typical episode of the series, the Flock finds itself distressed that The Farmer dared to get pizza and did not share any with them. Consequently, a few of the sheep dress up as a human and venture into town to get some for themselves. Along the way they scare and mystify people before somehow managing to convince the pizza guy to give them their pies despite their lack of cash.
Perhaps it is because stop-motion animation is an incredibly difficult process and consequently even the tiniest elements of the production have to be worked out in advance, but Shaun the Sheep has the sense of being perfectly put together. Even the smallest of jokes are well-thought out and executed.
In the end, Shaun the Sheep is an incredibly amount of fun for both young and old. Some of the jokes are too subtle for younger viewers, though all will enjoy watching the truly odd antics of the Flock, things like a Rocky-esque montage in the episode ""Shape up with Shaun"" in which Shirley the Sheep attempts to lose weight.
Shaun the Sheep doesn't attempt to tell large stories; they all range from the aforementioned ones to things like problems during bath time, but the stories are all well-executed, and, more impressively, they all use a minimal amount of — if any — dialogue. However, anyone watching will easily be able to discern what is taking place.
The DVD is short on extras. It contains a sing-a-long version of the theme as bonus material and that's it. Worse than that, rather than placing the words on top of the video, the video is made tiny and the words are placed underneath it. And, oddly, if one hits ""play all"" from the menu, the sing-a-long and some trailers for other shows play after each of the episodes of the show finish.
Even so, Shaun the Sheep is great where it really counts, in keeping the audience truly entranced at the characters on screen and their antics.",<urn:uuid:f11424aa-caf9-4b6a-99d8-aa445699ff3f>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://blogcritics.org/dvd-review-shaun-the-sheep-back/,2024-02-20T23:17:55Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9729904532432556,910,1.4433631896972656,1

When this happens, it is tempting to reach for that bottle of aspirin or ibuprofen to take the edge off. However, even over-the-counter medications like these come with side effects, including damage to the hearing and to the gastro-intestinal system, especially the stomach. The good news is that there are natural ways to help reduce the inflammation – and thus the pain – associated with many of these disease processes. Below is a list of 21 foods that are great for managing both inflammation and pain while giving the immunity a boost at the same time.
Ginger – Ginger’s strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties made it more effective at pain relief than ibuprofen in several studies.
Acai Juice – Acai berries are native to the Amazon area and have been used for centuries by native peoples for pain reduction and to increase energy levels.
Coffee – Studies have shown that coffee is particularly useful for headaches as it helps to constrict blood vessels and is often found as an adjuvant in OTC pain relievers.
Olive Oil – The polyphenols in olive oil have the well-documented ability to reduce pain-causing mechanisms in the body and are great for heart health, too.
Sage – For sore throats from the flu, bronchitis or allergies, sip some sage tea, which has been shown to soothe down irritated mucous membranes and relieve pain.
Almonds – The Omega 3 fatty acids in almonds are great for relieving stiffness and inflammation.
Walnuts – Walnuts and the oil made from them are also a rich source of inflammation-reducing Omega-3’s.
Leafy Green Vegetables – Spinach, kale, arugula and other leafy greens are high in Vitamin K, which is necessary for joint health and flexibility.
Purple Grapes – The resveratrol found in purple grapes has an analgesic effect similar to aspirin.
Flax Seeds – Flax seeds, like almonds and walnuts, are also high in anti-inflammatory Omega’s 3 fatty acids.
Turmeric – Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory both.
Salmon – This fatty fish is an excellent source of Omega 3’s to bring down inflammation.
Mackerel – Mackerel is another important source for Omega 3 fatty acids.
Herring – Like mackerel and salmon, this fatty fish will also provide a wealth of Omega 3’s.
Celery – This crunchy, delicious vegetable contains more than 20 anti-inflammatory compounds.
Tart Cherries – The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of tart cherries make it as effective as aspirin or ibuprofen at pain relief.
Blackberries – Like cherries, blueberries are rich in antioxidants and heat-shock proteins, which help to bring down inflammation.
Raspberries – Raspberries are also antioxidant-rich and contain heat-shock proteins.
Blueberries – Blueberries are another great source of antioxidants to help relieve pain and boost immunity.
Strawberries – Strawberries have the same antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits as the berries listed above.
Cayenne Pepper – The capsaicin in cayenne pepper has made it a favorite for arthritis treatment due to its incredibly powerful anti-inflammatory properties.
Adding these foods to the diet on the regular basis is a natural, healthy way to boost the immune system and reduce the pain and inflammation associated with arthritis and similar conditions.

"Yunnan BaiYao literally translated “Yunnan White Medicine” should be in every household medicine cabinet. It is great to include with your camping bag or your Bug Out Bag.
Yunnan BaiYao has gained recognition thanks to many of the Natural News writers. However the proper application has not been noted.
Besides stopping bleeding on an open cut, Yunnan BaiYao is also an analgesic for pain caused by trauma or what TCM calls blood stagnation. The analgesic effect is more effective when taken internally. Because of this the Yunnan BaiYao is far more superior than any “Veterinary Blood Stop Powder” which it has been compared to at one point. Generic Veterinary Blood Stop Powder has ammonia and aluminum which can be toxic to the body and it does not reduce pain. Therefore these Generic Veterinary Blood Stop Powder can not be ingested internally and it has no medicinal purpose when ingested.
Yunnan BaiYao can easily be comparable to QuickClot with more benefits.
Yunnan BaiYao contains all natural ingredients from plants that is completely safe for the body. The formula is still very secretly guarded by the Chinese government, which is more of the process of making it then the actual ingredients in it. The ingredients are listed in the packaging. Two of the most important ingredients are San Qi (panax notoginseng) and Shan Yao (Chinese Yam.) Panax notoginseng is one of the strongest analgesic herbs in TCM for blood stagnation. Panax notoginseng is one of the most underrated herbs in the Western world. Panax notoginseng has been used to treat certain cancers.
History of Yunnan BaiYao falls back to a famous TCM doctor Qu Huanzhang who created the formula in 1902. He also provided the formula to the south Vietnamese soldiers and the Chinese army. The soldiers carry it in the their emergency first aid kit. The formula has been in use for over 100 years. These days Yunnan BaiYao is in every Chinese soldier emergency kit.
Yunnan BaiYao comes in various forms. Besides in the original form as a powder form in a vial, it can be found as a capsule or a plaster too. I only recommend the powder form. The plaster has unnatural chemicals in it.
The powdered formula has multiple purposes. First it is a coagulant when applied topically, meaning it seals a cut. Second it is an analgesic stronger than aspirin for traumatic injuries or what TCM calls blood stagnation. The best way to use it as an analgesic is to taken internally.
Yunnan BaiYao heals by initiating white blood cell activities and promote blood circulation. It also resolve pus and counteract toxin.
Using the Yunnan BaiYao (powder)
Topical Application for Cuts:
1. Remove the glass vial from the box and unscrew the cap.
2. Save the RED BALL with the cotton and save it!!! This is very important!! (The Red Ball is not a desiccant!)
3. Spread the powder evenly over the open wound and watch it stop bleeding instantly. (Use sparingly.)
When applied topically you will feel a gripping effect like the wound is mending together.
Internal Ingestion as an Analgesic or to Stop Hemorrhaging:
1. Mix with water and drink the solution.
2. The powder can be absorbed orally too such as under the tongue but it is quite bitter.
3. For stronger effect, mix with wine.
For Severe Trauma with Blood Loss
Use the Red Ball saved by taking it internally with water.
The Red Ball is only included in the powdered form. It is actually a pill to prevent a person from going into shock. This is a very concentrated form of Yunnan Baiyao, called Baoxianzi or “Insurance Pill for a Serious or Emergency Case.”
Yunnan BaiYao, like all TCM formulas to invigorate blood, heals the body internally. It is great for internal and external bruising (trauma.) The pain will gradually fade and the bruising will go away faster with the Yunnan BaiYao.
Unfortunately the Yunnan BaiYao is not cheap anymore since Obama came into office. It was $2.50 per 4 gram vial before the rise of gas prices. It is around $5 per vial now.
Becareful of “copy cats” that are not the original formula.
This formula is commonly found in Chinese grocery stores, which can be as cheap as $4 per 4 gram vial. No need to order online because you will not find it cheaper than in a Chinese grocery store. Save money and buy a full box. For a full box of 6 vials, you can easily get it for around $25 at these Chinese grocery stores. There is no tax to it because it is labelled as a food product.
Do NOT internally take while pregnant. This herbal formula may cause abortion when taken internally. It is relatively safe for topical application.
Stop hemorrhaging (bruising)
Relieve chest pain due to blood stagnation or a heart attack.
Veterinary use: safe for dogs and horses

"As part of Master Gardener Week at the end of October, I had the opportunity to view “Five Seasons: The Gardens of Piet Oudolf” and participate in a discussion afterwards. This recently-released film has brought renewed attention to the gardens and landscapes created by this internationally-renowned designer. His popular public garden designs, and several books, have had a profound impact on the design of public spaces, as well as private gardens.
Oudolf’s gardens have been described as spontaneous, immersive and naturalistic, and rely heavily on grasses and structural perennials to maintain visual interest well into the winter. They evoke flower-filled meadows and prairies, and seem at first glance like places that could, indeed, have occurred spontaneously. Oudolf himself acknowledges, though, that they require a certain amount of “interference”, and his design process is comprehensive and very specific. He has a palette of plants that he has tested over time for durability and effect.
During the bloom season, one imagines these gardens will be buzzing with pollinators, and be places of lively, hungry activity. When it comes to pollinators, it seems, almost any garden is better than no garden at all, and a garden doesn’t need to be designed especially for pollinators in order to offer benefits to them. As research in this lab has shown, though, a garden designed specifically to be pollinator friendly has an outsized impact.
So I wondered, how pollinator-friendly are Oudolf’s naturalistic gardens, really?
On the positive side:
• Lots of flowers. From early season to late, things are blooming. Plants are left standing well into winter, providing seed and shelter.
• Little or no use of pesticides.
• Native plants are often included, though there is no particular emphasis on them.
On the negative side:
• Maintenance involves cutting everything to the ground in late winter. This destroys the winter homes of cavity-nesting bees that use the stems. At the Lurie garden in Chicago, this problem was recognized and steps were taken to leave some stems standing.
• Lack of layering. The iconic Oudolf garden is composed almost entirely of herbaceous perennials, with trees and large shrubs lacking. This limits the provision of food and habitat for a variety of creatures.
I believe pollinators could be better supported by Oudolf-style gardens with three simple changes.
• Keep mowed areas to a minimum. Group plants with good winter nesting stems, and leave them standing until they are covered by new growth.
• Include and group small groups of larger plants such as suitable small trees and shrubs.
• Prioritize native plants where possible.
If you would like to know more about Piet Oudolf’s gardens, plant choices, and design process, here are some reference materials. And if you get the chance, watch the film “Five Seasons: The Gardens of Piet Oudolf”.
Dream Plants for the Natural Garden by Henk Gerritsen and Piet Oudolf, Timber Press 2000
Essentially a catalog (although not all plants are pictured) of plants that Oudolf has culled to be “reliable plants that, over the years, can be maintained in an average garden without too much in the way of artificial props and bolstering”. Many of them “look good dead”, too. These are the plants he uses in his designs. They are divided into categories of Tough Perennials (the longest section by far), Playful Biennials and Annuals, Troublesome Invasive Plants, and Troublesome Capricious Plants – hardly the usual categories!
If you are an experienced gardener and want an invaluable reference for plants that will enhance your natural garden without requiring loads of work, this book is for you.
Planting Design: Gardens in Time and Space by Piet Oudolf and Noel Kingsbury, Timber Press 2005
On the other hand, if you are not an experienced gardener, this book might be a better place to start. It is a thrifty introduction to the concepts of how gardens fit into nature, and vice versa, and how plants can be used through space – and time! – to create the desired outcomes. There are many lists of plants for specific purposes, such as Small Trees to combine with perennials, and Biennials for self-sowing, and a short but useful section on how to prepare for, implement, and maintain a planting of this sort.
Planting: A New Perspective by Piet Oudolf and Noel Kingsbury, Timber Press 2013
This book builds on the previous two, offering a detailed look at the techniques and philosophy Oudolf uses to design his gardens, as well as specific ways in which he uses plants in them. A season-by-season guide dissects various effects and combinations, and a chart towards the end concisely organizes many of the plants used. One of the most interesting concepts is that of matrix planting.
For more detail on the creation of specific gardens by Piet Oudolf, there are also books on Hummelo, the High Line, and Durslade Farm.
The Self-Sustaining Garden by Peter Thompson, Timber Press 2007
In this book matrix planting is presented in great detail. This is an effective and efficient way of designing intermingled plantings without having to specify the location of each and every plant. The matrix (often grasses) may be made up of several plant species, and serves as a stage for other, showier compatible plants embedded in it.
Dramatic Effects with Architectural Plants by Noel Kingsbury, Overlook Press, 1997
Oudolf’s chief writing partner has produced many noteworthy books himself. As the title describes, this book focuses on plants with strong and dramatic architecture. Having some of these in the mix is a key technique that makes Oudolf’s designs work.
Naturalistic Planting Design by Nigel Dunnett, filbert press 2019
With a foreword by, who else, Piet Oudolf, this is one of the most recent entries in the category of books focusing on natural or naturalistic design. It’s a dense book with at least as much text as photography, covering garden lore from historic, through contemporary, and looking to the future. Basic design principles, as they pertain to a naturalistic design, are also presented, along with a series of case studies illustrated by seasonal photos.
Gardening with Native Plants of the Pacific Northwest by Arthur Kruckeberg and Linda Chalker-Scott, University of Washington Press, 2019.
And finally, if you want to use PNW native plants to achieve Oudolf-like effects in your garden, this recent book is an accessible, thorough, well-illustrated guide to those plants. You will find it easy to browse through for plants that have the look you want. Symbols by each photo give a hint as to each plant’s cultural requirements.
The blog Gardenista has several lovely entries on aspects of Oudolf’s designs. https://www.gardenista.com/posts/?t=oudolf#search

"For the last few weeks there have been a small but very dedicated group of parents coming in each week to read with the children.
Book Talk is not only a lovely moment for the children to enjoy reading with a range of different community members but is also a fantastic way to develop a love of literature through enjoying reading together, discussing different books and texts and drawing attention to the smaller details that authors and illustrators use to draw readers in, keep them engaged and develop curiosities.
What would be really fantastic is if there were a few more parents available to come in and read with the children, especially Dad’s!
This would provide a wider range of community members to read with and also mean the children can read in smaller groups!
No need to confirm your availability – just rock up on Friday mornings, sign in at the office and come to the neighbourhood and await selection!
The more the merrier!

About the Beta Channel
The Beta Channel is the place we preview experiences that are closer to what we will ship to our general customers. Because the Dev and Beta Channels represent parallel development paths from our engineers, there may be cases where features and experiences show up in the Beta Channel first. However, this does not mean every feature we try out in the Beta Channel will ship. We encourage Insiders to read this blog post that outlines the ways we’ll try things out with Insiders in both the Dev and Beta Channels.
*Getting new features: For Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel who want to be the first to get features gradually rolled out to you, you can turn ON the toggle to get the latest updates as they are available via Settings > Windows Update. Over time, we will increase the rollouts of features to everyone with the toggle turned on. Should you keep this toggle off, new features will gradually be rolled out to your device over time once they are ready.
**Availability of Copilot in Windows: Copilot in Windows in preview is being rolled out gradually to Windows Insiders in select global markets. The initial markets for the Copilot in Windows preview include North America, United Kingdom and parts of Asia and South America. It is our intention to add additional markets over time.

"Coming in hot, with a bold new look, Solaris Stellar Horizon is the third major revision of the Campfire Solaris. With a higher $2670 price tag, Campfire aims to elevate Solaris to the next level of flagship performance. Can Stellar Horizon maintain the core characteristics of Solaris while adding improvements in the sound and performance that deliver a truly endgame IEM experience?
Build and Design
The first, most obvious change from previous generations of Campfire Audio products is the all new packaging. Solaris is packed in a wooden box that transforms into a display stand for the IEMs. Along with that, there’s a soft leather case, three MMCX cables (4.4mm, 3.5mm, and 2.5mm terminations), and a good number of smaller add-ons. The cables are silver-plated copper and use Campfire’s new “Time Stream” design with a flat configuration that places the 4 cable cores side-by-side rather than weaved together.
You also get things like the warranty card, certificate of authenticity, an excerpt from a short story themed around the Stellar Horizon, and a trading card. The trading cards are something new that Campfire Audio has been doing, with cards representing a number of different products in Campfire history. The latest releases now have the product card bundled with them, but you can also buy packs separately to complete the collection.
The IEM itself has a brushed stainless steel housing, with a design on the front that resembles a piece of a star chart or a map of the solar system on each earpiece. The look is very unique, and the feel is of a very high quality well-made shell. These are slightly heavy, but also among the most comfortable Solaris options. They’re probably about the same size and comfort level as the Solaris 2020. Overall, this is an excellent design and a really unique package that’s filled to the brim with premium extras.
When I think about the core characteristics of the Solaris, it’s a tuning that’s balanced, natural, and just slightly warm – along with having a good sized soundstage. With the exception of Solaris 2020, there’s also an added element of style to it, with the gold plated original Solaris being a visual standout. The visual design team certainly got the memo, but does the tuning both capture key characteristics of Solaris while also improving on the sound?
The first thing I noticed was that Stellar Horizon is the most revealing, resolving Solaris yet, with a top end that combines the best aspects of the original Solaris and the 2020 version, while also refining both. It’s also slightly tighter in the bass, aiming for detail, texture, and accuracy rather than warmth.
The bass is largely linear, with good extension, and clearly a focus on bass quality – but it also provides a good amount of bass quantity. Solaris gives you the physical impact and natural character of a dynamic driver bass, but keeps it all well under control for a low-end that has just little more heft than being truly “neutral.”
The midrange is full and rich, offering a natural timbre and excellent detail. The transition from the bass is clean, with a subtle hint of warmth. The vocals have a slightly forward presentation with an intimate, holographic feeling. There’s a strong sense of cohesive layering that highlights the finer details and avoids congestion.
The treble is the real star of the show, offering good extension and air, along with a level of definition that allows you to dive into the different layers of a song, without the definition being so strong as to feel unnatural or etched. There’s a bit of a revealing element to the treble – enough that you can really appreciate the finer details of a well mastered, high resolution track, but not so much that you can’t stand to listen to older or poorly mastered tracks.
The soundstage and imaging is as strong as ever, with a stage that’s both wide and deep, and a three dimensional presentation. Imaging seems more focused on cohesion than exaggerated separation. There’s a great weight and body to the instruments and voices, and a holographic sense to the placement and character of each, and an overall lifelike, immersive feeling to the stereo image.
The bass feels positively alive on Lakeside’s “Fantastic Voyage,” with a fullness and texture to the bass guitar and a nice sense of contrast with the synthesized bass. Along with the classic, deep, funky groove, “Fantastic Voyage” proves to be an excellent demonstration of Solaris’s imaging and layering. Everything from the guitars to the key and voices has a really clear sense of placement, both left to right and front to back, and it all works together to provide a really fun listening experience.
“Pariah” by Steven Wilson remains one of my favorite vocal reference tracks, with the soft male vocal on the verses and the more raspy female vocal on the chorus. The key aspects are the balance between the male and female vocals and how it captures the details in each: Steven Wilson’s more breathy but emotive delivery and Ninet Tayeb’s greater dynamic range. Along with that, the song is mastered with a great deal of dynamics and ample opportunity for the vocals to get lost or drowned out as layers of guitars and synths build to its crescendo. Solaris Stellar Horizon gets all of this – from the unique details of the two voices to the building of dynamic layers throughout the song.
Danny Elfman is best known for his highly memorable movie themes, but he also has works which include more traditional classical pieces. “I. Grave. Animato” from his violin concerto offers a more reserved, somber sound than his Spider-Man or Edward Scissorheads soundtracks. The warm, lush layers of strings are a great demonstration of Solaris’ highly natural timbre, and strong resolution. Each instrument has a strong sense of individual character, giving the listener an almost tactile sense of the bowing of the strings and providing a great sense of clarity of each instrument. It’s all punctuated by the subtle warmth that keeps it all grounded and enhances the sense of cohesion as the song builds from just violins into a full orchestra.
Comparison: Noble Audio Sultan, 64 Audio U12t
There are few IEMs as universally loved as the 64 Audio U12t, and so it makes a great comparison for just about anything in the $2000-$3000 range both in terms of the tuning of the IEMs and the level of sound and performance for the money. For another comparison, one of my first thoughts about the Noble Sultan on its release was that it was in some ways like an upscaled Campfire Solaris. Now that the Solaris has been upscaled a bit, how does it compare to the Sultan?
In terms of the build, design, and package, Solaris Stellar Horizon wins hands down. Its stainless steel shells and faceplate design match U12t in comfort and durability and exceed what Sultan is doing in terms of visual design. And other than Sultan providing the most protective case of the group, the Stellar Horizon package is head and shoulders above 90% of the IEM packages out there right now – even at this premium price point.
In terms of sound, Sultan and Solaris share a lot in common with each having some small advantages over the other. U12t goes for a slightly different tuning, but they’re all in the same general family of balanced but not fully neutral tunings. Both Sultan and Solaris have a bass presentation that’s slightly emphasized and well extended, but doesn’t cross into exaggerated “basshead” territory. U12t emphasizes the bass a little more, but there’s a somewhat different character to the more emphasized balanced armature bass compared to the tighter presentation of a dynamic driver bass. In particular, Solaris demonstrates the strongest sense of detail and texture in the bass, while Sultan can feel a little less precise, and U12t’s bass is more smooth sounding.
The midrange is where Solaris shines, with the natural timbre, excellent vocals, and generally strong cohesion. U12t is pulled back more in the mids, offering a little less of a highlight to vocals, and sometimes hitting a little darker in the timbre. Sultan has strong low mids, but isn’t as strong in the upper mids. As a side-effect of the tribrid design, Sultan doesn’t have the same sense of coherence as U12t or Solaris either, with the crossover between the BAs in the mids and the ESTs in the high sometimes feeling slightly off in a way that you just can’t place.
The treble is where Sultan really shines though, demonstrating excellent resolution and good balance in the tuning. The fine details of vocals, guitars, and other instruments are incredibly well presented, with vocals having just a little more sustain, and cymbals feeling just a little bit crisper than the competition. Solaris comes close, but can’t quite reach the same level of resolution. While U12t has a great sense of air in the upper treble it comes up short on the fine instrumental and vocal details when compared to Solaris and Sultan.
Solaris Stellar Horizon succeeds at everything it needs to do. It provides a clear improvement in sound quality of the previous versions, but it also retains the core characteristics of past versions of Solaris – even combining and refining the unique pieces of the original and 2020 Solaris. Stellar Horizon is a balanced, natural sounding IEM with performance that exceeded our expectations, delivering a true flagship listening experience.",<urn:uuid:6f24443c-6e52-4dde-84f9-90f41b73ea6c>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://bloomaudio.com/blogs/articles/perfectly-balanced-campfire-audio-solaris-stellar-horizon-2023-review,2024-02-20T22:30:48Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9455676078796387,2046,1.0242098569869995,1

"My sons 3Po and Jammy seem to be entering an extremely physical stage in their development. They've always been live wires, running around 24/7, but now that they've entered kindergarten they're on the go with their friends -- and sometimes they end up punching each other. Alfie says it's nothing to worry about, and he's probably right, but we both agree that we want to limit their exposure to violence in the media.
That's why I appreciate fantasy games like Ubisoft's Battle of Giants series for Nintendo DS -- they recognize that boys are very physically oriented and like to act out power struggles in their pretend and fantasy play, but they don't depict humans fighting and killing each other. The characters in these games clearly belong in the fantasy realm, so my boys are clear about pretend and real. If I'm going to let my boys play a videogame, I'd rather have one of dragons fighting rather than real people!
3Po and Jammy already enjoy the Dragons and Dinosaurs games, and now that Ubisoft kindly sent us a copy of the latest Battle of Giants game: Mutant Insects, they have even more avenues for fantasy play. Like the previous two, Mutant Insects allows the boys to create characters -- in this case, mutant insects like scorpions, spiders and praying mantises -- and put them into battle with each other. The more they play, the more they can build their insect's special powers and attributes.
Here's a description of the game from Ubisoft:
In a far distant future, a gigantic asteroid went out of orbit and collided with Earth. This terrible catastrophe left only ruins in its wake, forever changing Earth’s landscape….and its inhabitants. Insects, the most adaptable form of life on Earth, have mutated to transform into massive giants and become the new rulers of the planet.
As one of four mutated insects, travel through the barely recognizable lands while battling gigantic enemies to find the source of the mutation. Your goal? Become the strongest mutant insect on the planet and survive the chaos!
Now that the boys can read, it's less frustrating for them since the game requires players to read simple instructions. They're really been enjoying this game, and I have even seen them take the mutant insects theme into their pretend-play sessions with plastic insect figurines!

"photo credit: Virginia Beach Facebook page
It's summertime and it's time to hit the beach! I love spending time at the beach because no one is ever in a hurry. There are no band practices to attend, no soccer games to rush to, no volunteer hours at the library to complete. Everyone is just happy to splash in the surf, play on the sand, spend quality time with their families and make every moment last. And there's no better place for special moments than at Virginia Beach. It's a wonderful summer destination where couples and families can love every single moment! Here are ten great ways to Love the Moment at Virginia Beach:
1) Discover the Beaches
Virginia Beach has three amazing beaches: Chesapeake Bay, Resort Area and Sandbridge. That's 35 miles of sun, sand and surf, and each one has something to suit every kind of person, whether you're a social animal looking for a volleyball game to join, or a family with little kids, or a couple looking to escape to their own beach paradise.
2) Soak up the sun
The summers are hot and the winters are mild (6 months out of the year, the high temp is 70 degrees or higher, so you can leave your earmuffs at home. Just remember to slather on the sunscreen!
3) Feast on the bounty of the ocean
Whenever I'm in a seaside town I always make it a point to enjoy seafood, because it's sure to be fresh. Blue crabs, rockfish, flounder, mackerel, you name it, Virginia Beach has got it. Foodies can even book a Coastal Food Tour to see how it all goes from farm (or sea!) to table.
4) Dive into the ocean world
The beach itself is not the only way you can get acquainted with life under the sea. You can also visit the Virginia Aquarium, with changing exhibits, IMAX® movies and lots and lots of fish!
5) Shop your hearts out
Hey, shopaholics need something to do to. Fortunately they need look no further than Lynhaven Mall, one of the largest malls on the East Coast, with three department stores, over 180 specialty stores, services, eateries and movie theaters.
6) Boogie on the Boardwalk
If you're done with lying on a beach towel, you can also take the family to the boardwalk. It's three whole miles of fun, with biking, rollerblading, cafes and more.
7) Groove to the music
It's just one summer-long party in Virginia Beach! Atlantic Avenue between 17th & 25th Streets turns into ""Beach Street USA"" with summer entertainment, music on the boardwalk every night of the week. What a great atmosphere!
8) Get your funk on
Speaking of music, don't miss the this year's FunkFest on Beach Street! August 24-25, which celebrates the music generated over the years by influential legends such as James Brown, Sly and the Family Stone, George Clinton, and The Ohio Players. Mark your calendars for August 24 and 25!
9) Make a home away from home
I like that you can find a place to stay at Virgina Beach, whatever your budget. There are campgrounds, vacation rental homes, or a hotel suite, so you and your family can always find a home away from home.
10) Get your heart pumping
The beautiful ocean views aren't the only thing that can get your pulse racing at Virginia Beach. Whether it's parasailing, windsurfing, fishing, kayaking or sailing, you can enjoy an active outdoor lifestyle at Virginia Beach. Of course, there's nothing wrong with just relaxing on a towel and whiling your vacation hours away.

"For those who have worked with a lot of collected junipers, this post can be summed up with two photos.
Sierra juniper before repotting- 31″ tall
Sierra juniper after repotting
I acquired this tree in the pot pictured at top so I assumed there were some important roots that emerged quite a ways from the trunk. The hope is always that there are some roots closer in which would facilitate planting the tree in a smaller container.
When I took the tree out of its container, I was happy to see lots of fine roots everywhere. The question remained, however, where the roots came from.
I began my investigation on the left side of the rootball as it was the furthest point from the base of the trunk.
Fine roots at the end of a long root on the left side
I found that I could shorten the trunk a few inches without losing many roots.
The end section of the long root
Further investigation revealed a significant root with a lot of fine roots attached. I was curious of there were other significant roots so I followed the main root back to the trunk. Along the way, I no additional roots.
The long root on the left side
The right side also proved to be a bust. Although the deadwood is nice on that side, there is no active lifeline.
Right side of the rootball – the fine roots all emerge from the big root at the far end of the tree
As soon as I realized the tree was far from ready for a bonsai pot, I planted it in a narrow wooden box where it can grow for a year or two before I line up some root grafts. In the meantime, I can start thinking about how to design a compact tree around the deadwood along the trunk.

King of Wrath (Kings of Sin #1) by Ana Huang
Publication Date : October 18, 2022
Read Date : December 8, 2023
Genre : Romance
Pages : 450
Other books I have read by the same Author –
She’s the wife he never wanted…and the weakness he never saw coming.
Ruthless. Meticulous. Arrogant.
Dante Russo thrives on control, both personally and professionally.
The billionaire CEO never planned to marry— until the threat of blackmail forces him into an engagement with a woman he barely knows.
Vivian Lau, jewelry heiress and daughter of his newest enemy.
It doesn’t matter how beautiful or charming she is. He’ll do everything in his power to destroy the evidence and their betrothal.
There’s only one problem: now that he has her…he can’t bring himself to let her go.
Elegant. Ambitious. Well-mannered.
Vivian Lau is the perfect daughter and her family’s ticket into the highest echelons of high society.
Marrying a blue-blooded Russo means opening doors that would otherwise remain closed to her new-money family.
While the rude, elusive Dante isn’t her idea of a dream partner, she agrees to their arranged marriage out of duty.
Craving his touch was never part of the plan.
Neither was the worst thing she could possibly do: fall in love with her future husband.
King of Wrath is a steamy arranged marriage/billionaire romance. It is book one in the Kings of Sin series but can be read as a standalone. It contains explicit content, profanity, and mild violence. Recommended for mature readers only.
I absolutely loved the Twisted series and as soon as I finished it, I was dying to read Dante’s story and now that I finally read it, I’m happy to say it didn’t disappoint me.
King of Wrath is the best book I read by the author. I love this as much as Twisted Lies. It is a captivating tale of love, power, desires, and dysfunctional family and relationships. It might not be most original story but as I have read her other books I knew what to expect. Like all her books, it felt refreshing and engaging.
Power in Ana Huang’s books lies with her characters. They have something in them that draws you in from the very first page.
Dante is ruthless, powerful, cold, and control freak CEO. He prides himself on having control over everything in his life, even with his emotions. I usually don’t like controlling men in romance but the author made me fall for Dante without an ounce of doubt.
I loved seeing him change bit by bit. He never liked the situation he was put in, he didn;t show he was interested in it or was going to try to work it out but he never disrespected Vivian, not truly. He was closed to conversations that looked like he was an asshole but it wasn’t his fault, just his nature and being reminded or having reminders of what Vivian’s father did to him didn’t help.
But as story progressed, developing feelings was inevitable, even for a person like Dante. He tried to push it away and it didn’t work for him and I loved how he treated Vivian like she was everything in the world after that. The dates he planned were swoon-worthy. I loved them even more when he was trying to win her back. His patience and persistence were admirable.
I liked him even more after knowing about his family and how it affected him and his brother. It was great to get his mother’s perspective and also how Vivian supported him and made them put more effort with Dante. They weren’t the best parents but like Dante said his parents looked lovely compared to Vivian’s.
Vivian at first looked like a meek and mild-mannered society girl who would do anything for her parents and that isn’t the most negative point but I never liked her parents, especially her father who sold his daughter to arrange marriage through blackmail just so he could get into blue-blooded society circle.
I hated her father even more for his gut to threaten Dante. Idiot didn’t even know what would happen to him once he lost his leverage and all this time he kept criticizing Vivian and kept saying it’s because of him they have this lavish life. I never like it when parents make “raising the child and making their life comfortable” an obligation that the child has to pay for by doing what they say regardless of their own feelings.
I have seen such parents who say “I raised you, I paid for your studies that made you reach at this position.. I did this, I did that…” and I have seen how that makes their offspring look guilty for something they didn’t do wrong. So I might be biased but I hate this kind of parenting and emotional blackmail.
Clutches of such emotional parenting blackmail Vivian felt was realistic and genuine. I could get how it made her feel. It was just sad it took Vivian so long to see what her father did and was doing. All these times her friends and every other person in life kept telling her she didn’t have to do what he said but it took a blow of truth that involved Dante to make her stand up for herself. Even though she was hurt Dante didn’t tell her the truth, I loved her for not giving in to another blackmail by her father.
I wish she hadn’t taken so long to forgive Dante but I can oversee it as I loved seeing Dante wooing her and how all that solidified their relationship even more. It was fabulous to see her succeding in her career as well.
I loved Vivian’s friends – Sloane and Isabella. They were amazing supporting characters. I also enjoyed meeting people in Dante’s circle, especially Kai. I’m sure he and Isabella will make an amazing story so I’m definitely reading next book in this series ASAP.
The climax was as I anticipated. Like I said before, what I didn’t anticipate was how long it took for Vivian to forgive Dante but in the end, it worked out just perfectly.
Overall, King of Wrath is a captivating, entertaining, relatable billionaire romance with hate to love and arranged marriage trope.
I highly recommend King of Wrath if you like,

"You might be an expert at grabbing the attention of your customers with a stylish desktop call to action, but a mobile website CTA is not the same. The way your customers browse from a mobile is a lot different to desktop browsing and for this reason you’ll need to think about how a call to action should be delivered on a mobile website successfully. This article gives some tips on how you can approach the mobile CTA problem.
Colorful, but In-line with your Website Design
This should be common knowledge by now but a call to action on any platform should be made colorful and easy to spot. We’d suggest creating a button or banner that stands out from the rest of your website – your call to action should make everything else look tiny in comparison. Not only is this important for grabbing your visitor’s attention, but it’s also important for capturing those mobile users in a hurry that just want to make a quick buy online.
At the end of the day, you want to draw visitor’s eyes to the big button that brings them a step closer to making a purchase. However, there is a certain technique you can use so that you don’t technically have to get their attention at all, because you’ll already have it. More is explained below.
Put it Right in Front of Their Eyes
If you are creating a call to action on mobile, you should not place it in a sidebar or at the bottom of your product description. You should certainly not place a call to action at the footer of your page either. If you have something to sell, whether it be a service or a product, your call to action for this sale should be immediately available when a visitor loads up your web page.
Studies show that wasting your mobile visitor’s time is going to result in a huge loss of sales. Whilst a lot of mobile users back out when a page is taking too long to load, some will also look elsewhere if they cannot find the page they need quickly. If they want to purchase a product, you should bet that your customers will want to find the call to action very quickly.
For this reason, we suggest placing a call to action as a major feature of your mobile page. If visitors are coming to your website for a certain reason, put easy access to it. Putting it as a large graphic of text banner will work, as long as it is the first thing they see when hitting your landing page.
It’s a little bit difficult if you sell multiple products or services like this because your users may be looking for different things when visiting your website. If you have your smarts about you, you could correlate data with your most popular products and place this as the first thing visitors will see when hitting your mobile website. Alternatively, if you have a sale then this could appear straight up at the front.
A better option may be to include a parallax content slider on your website that automatically goes through a selection of your most popular products/services. Either way, it’s important that you can put your visitor’s eyes right on what you’re trying to sell as soon as they come in through the front door.
It’s not just about providing quick access to mobile users either. A study by Mobify shows that a lot of mobile sales are spontaneous – a potential customer may not come to your website to directly make a purchase, but if you can throw out your best product in front of them straight away, they may just make a quick purchase right on the spot.
In summary, it’s important to understand how to place your call to action correctly on your mobile website. Even if you go for a more traditional route that lists mobile CTAs similarly to how you would show them on your desktop website, you should still consider placing a large call to action on your front page.
Mobile users are quick to react, want instant access to products and services, and sometimes can be a little spontaneous as well. An eye-catching front page call to action can work wonders on a mobile website for this reason.",<urn:uuid:0c0d39bf-9cb3-4163-8420-ec736ca33ad2>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://boostonemobile.com/tag/mobile-call-to-action-best-practices,2024-02-20T21:39:33Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9476397633552551,847,1.1180212497711182,1
"Hey I was playing BTB and I hired the Cathayan Merchant and he recently got the Stone Cutter Skill.
Me and Joker2and53 were reading it and had questions on how it worked.
1. If I sell 5 Wyrd Stone what happens? Do I get the bonus or penality on 1 stone or all 5 stones? If I get the bonus on all 5 stones do I roll 5d6 and each shard gets the bonus or penalty separately or 1d6 to determine the bonus/penalty for all the stones?
2. If I roll a penalty can I choose to not sell the shards or sell fewer of them, and if so can I sell them later and try to refine them again?
I figure that you would roll separately for each stone, and you would not be able to choose to not sell and attempt refine them again. I would declare the number of shards I was selling then roll. So for example I would declare I was selling 5 shards with 12 guy that would be 80 gold, then I would roll to determine the bonus and/or penalty from the Stone Cutter skill. If I rolled 1,2,4,5,6 Then I would 80 + 7d6 -4d6.
I also wonder when I am calculating gold amounts can I cancel +1d6 with -1d6, or do I have to roll them?
This would come-up with the haggle skill as well if you are buying items that have a variable cost.",<urn:uuid:db87b63c-ae55-4837-8e5b-0eddf2e508c1>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://boringmordheimforum.forumieren.com/t4154-cathayan-merchant-and-the-stone-cutter-skill,2024-02-20T22:00:24Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9740657210350037,308,1.0533995628356934,1

"Pastor Robert shares the good news and hope we have through Christ by reminding us that there is no more condemnation and no separation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
First segment: Lynn Jackson of the Dred Scott Heritage Foundation talks about upcoming and ongoing events the organization is participating in but also changes within the foundation itself. Second segment: Bev Ehlen talks about her new organization Liberty Link Missouri and various legislative battles on the horizon in Missouri. Also a PSA for the Missouri Republican Party Caucus.
To live out our faith in today’s world, we need to cultivate greater tenacity, diligence, and boldness. In this sermon, Pastor Allen Jackson invites us into training. Instead of passively “trying” to follow God, it’s time to pursue Him like someone who is training for a race. With this approach, difficulties won’t stop us. Instead, they will lead to new skills, new strength, and new nimbleness as our faith and understanding of God grows. Pastor Allen explains the difference between a transactional faith (saying a prayer and then living life however we desire) and embracing a transformational faith—one that can bring freedom to every area of our lives as we grow in our understanding of God and our relationship with Him.

"Cuatro Vientos is a high-quality coffee brand backed by a traditional, complex process dependent on specific atmospheric conditions that bestow distinction and prestige to the product. As if it were a treasure, its search is rewarded in the high areas of the state of Veracruz, Mexico, being the only place for the collection of coffee beans that will meet the expected flavor.
It is a brand that is guided by the tradition and culture of Mexico. The worldview of our ancestors attests to a past in which honoring different gods was the way to make sense of any event. This ceremonial past encompasses traditions from diverse cultures throughout Mexico, all of which share mysticism and introspection through celestial rituals that explained their reality.",<urn:uuid:403115a1-6eda-40f1-82fe-67dcb1f04a36>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://brada.co/en/category/food-drink/,2024-02-20T23:17:40Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9582010507583618,146,1.2420005798339844,1

"Worcester Live also runs the annual Worcester Festival, the Historic Ghost Walk of Worcester and a Children’s Ghost Walk. The organisation also has a producing arm in the form of the Swan Theatre’s resident professional theatre company, the Worcester Repertory Company, which produces two annual Shakespeare productions: the outdoor Shakespeare at the Commandery and Shakespeare at the Cathedral, as well as touring shows, Theatre In Education tours, new work and the annual Swan Theatre Pantomime. The Swan Theatre is also home to the award-winning Swan Youth Theatre, and runs the Swan Theatre School: a professional one-year foundation course for those looking to enter the industry.
Worcester Live relies heavily on charitable donations to exist, including arts grants, money from trusts, legacies and other organisations, and fundraising events.
The Bransford Trust is one of Worcester Live’s biggest and most loyal supporters. The Trust’s continued and generous support has not only helped the organisation to continue moving forward as a whole, but has also contributed hugely to specific projects.
The Bransford Trust has supported the annual Worcester Festival since 2004. Since the first Worcester Festival only a year earlier in 2003, the Festival has grown year on year, not only in terms of the number of events, but also the number of venues involved and the number of people enjoying those events. The support of the Bransford Trust has been invaluable in helping that to happen. The Festival is for the people of Worcester and its surrounds. It revolves around a series of partnerships between large cross sections of the community and provides an umbrella for a huge range of events and activities. It is a coming together of people of all ages, an opportunity for individuals, organisations, groups and charities to stage events, as well as to attend and take part in a vast selection of both professional and community activities. It is a vibrant celebration of life, and of Worcester and its people. The Bransford Trust’s continued support has helped enable Worcester Live to offer this fantastic community focused event.
The Trust has also supported the Worcester Repertory Company in its two biggest annual projects, Shakespeare at the Commandery, which began back in 2007, and Shakespeare at the Cathedral, a series launched in 2012 with a highly critically acclaimed production of Macbeth. The Bransford Trust's continued support for both these events has enabled them to grow year on year. Both events are now well established and have allowed the Worcester Rep not only to build strong relationships with the community - not least by building strong bonds with these two important historic venues - but also to build a strong reputation for delivering high quality and accessible theatre to an ever-increasing audience. They have also served as flagship projects, increasing general awareness of the Company and what it does. This in turn, has allowed the Rep to produce an ever-growing repertoire, in an increasingly diverse range of venues and locations, all over the country.
“The continuous and generous support from the Bransford Trust has been absolutely invaluable in enabling us to do what we do – deliver an exciting and diverse arts programme to the people of Worcester and beyond. There is no doubt that without the generosity of organisations such as the Bransford Trust, both in terms of financial and practical help, Worcester Live would find it much more difficult to survive.” Chris Jaeger, Chief Executive of Worcester Live.",<urn:uuid:62b37014-a380-4714-864f-c6ba4ba626dd>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://bransfordtrust.org/case-studies/case-study-2.aspx,2024-02-20T21:34:46Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9687802195549011,688,1.2341856956481934,1

"Nice homage to the famous Captain America No. cover where Cap punched Adolf Hitler–only this time, Captain American punches QAnon insurrectionist Jake Angeli.
The most bizarre conspiracy theory in a year filled with bizarre conspiracy theories is the QAnon conspiracy theory that China is actively at war with the United States on the Canadian border.
On December 8, 2020, a small earthquake was detected in Maine, near the border with New Brunswick, Canada.
The QAnon conspiracy version is that there were nearly 50,000 Chinese soldiers massed on the US-Canadian border ready to invade. But the soldiers were destroyed by bombs that were the real cause of the earthquake.
The Maine National Guard actually put out a statement denying that there was a military conflict between China and the United States at the Canadian border,
“The Maine National Guard has no knowledge of any such troop movement or military action, and would undoubtedly have been made aware through military or emergency management channels if such a significant event were to occur in the state of Maine,” Maj. Carl Lamb told Task & Purpose in a statement on Wednesday. “In addition to constantly maintaining a ready force, our focus right now is assisting our fellow citizens by responding to requests from Maine Emergency Management Agency and Maine CDC in response to COVID-19.”
On December 8, an Air National Guard pilot involved in training exercises was killed after his F-16 crashed in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. QAnon folks quickly claimed was that Chinese forces on the Canadian border shot down the F-16.
Qanon folks picked up the thread this week in the aftermath of the horrific Christmas Day suicide bombing that occurred in Nashville when Anthony Quinn Warner detonated his explosives-filled RV. QAnon folks started circulating videos and claims online that the explosion was actually a missile strike, possibly connected to China.",<urn:uuid:d0ad2167-8ebf-4b01-982b-b888573376fa>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://brian.carnell.com/articles/tag/qanon/,2024-02-20T22:48:28Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9718641638755798,379,1.1902496814727783,1
"Myles and Chris are a perfect example of the type of people who make Portland so damn awesome. Myles is a super talented photographer and together she and Chris created Rugby, the band. (I highly recommend watching their latest music video, Bag of Bones, filmed in Astoria.)
The day we set out to photograph their love session the sun was bright, the car was full of a dozen different outfits, and I was beyond excited to finally catch my first glimpse of Rowena Crest.
For the first half of their session we decided to go with a casual vibe while we hiked a mile or so out to cliffs overlooking the Columbia River Gorge. Myles and Chris rocked their 90’s grunge inspired wardrobe like no one else while I tromped along in my typical black on black getup, nervous as hell about the camera crew following us around getting material for a promo video PICR created about my little photo biz.
After making our way out to the river and back we switched gears and went with something a little more dramatic while we watched the sun go down during the 2nd half of their session. Golden hour at Rowena Crest is absolutely magical and the sky matched Myles’s lavender hair perfectly, a sight you’ll have to see in my next blog post, Myles & Chris Part 2!",<urn:uuid:46067b4d-4e55-4626-ab9e-7dad0b3ca626>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://brianamorrison.com/anniversary-and-engagement-photos/rowena-crest-portrait-photographer/,2024-02-20T23:04:26Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9583092331886292,275,0.6632368564605713,1
"If you’re reading this blog post, chances are you and your significant other have hit a snag in the relationship. Maybe you’re spending less time with each other and you’ve grown apart. Or maybe you do little else than argue these days.
All relationships go through their ups and downs. No matter the good intentions of the individuals or how in love you were when the relationship began, it is completely natural for a relationship to take a hit every now and then.
In some ways, these trials can be a good thing. Much like you need to break down muscle to build it up stronger than it was before, many relationships can be strengthened by challenges, provided your communication is healthy.
Here are some ways to improve communication in your relationship:
1. Recognize the Change
It’s important to be open and honest with yourself and each other. Don’t deny that something has changed in your relationship, admit it openly. You may also need to recognize that each of you has changed over the years. None of us stays the same. Our wants, needs, passions, annoyances, etc. change as we mature and grow as people. People can usually accommodate this change as long as they admit it has happened.
2. Validate Each Other’s Feelings
There are two words that are very powerful in communication, “Yes, and…” Effective communication is not about one person being right and the other wrong. Often, both people are right and allowed to feel their feelings. Try not to attack the other person or get them to compromise on issues. Instead, focus on simply being heard and hearing the other person.
3. Be Ready to Change
If you want to improve your communication as a means to get the other person to change their ways, you are really thinking about this communication thing all wrong! Good communication is not about winning an argument. This is not a debate class. Your goal is to better share your thoughts, feelings, ideas, hopes and struggles with each other. Don’t be so focused on getting the other person to change and focus more on how your own behavior could change.
Managing your emotions is one of the most important skills when it comes to interpersonal interaction. How often are you ready to blow when you and your spouse or partner are speaking to each other? How does the communication breakdown once you or your partner have become emotional?
When communicating with your partner, or anyone, should you feel your emotions rise, stop, take a slow, deep breath, and let it out. Taking this moment is important and will help you not to say something you’ll regret or that will escalate the situation.
None of us are perfect. All we can do is try to be the best versions of ourselves we can be for ourselves and our loved ones. By following these communication tips you will be able to strengthen your relationships.",<urn:uuid:36785242-1afe-4b32-b191-a1999d4ff356>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://bricolagewellness.com/4-ways-to-improve-communication-in-your-relationship/,2024-02-20T21:54:56Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9696929454803467,597,1.783423662185669,2

"Brisbane Roar Youth Head Coach John Sime has announced his squad for the upcoming National Youth League 2012/13 season ahead of next week’s opening round match against Perth Glory.
Brisbane Roar Youth Head Coach John Sime has announced his squad for the upcoming National Youth League 2012/13 season ahead of next week-s opening round match against Perth Glory.
While all of his squad members are under the age of 21, Sime has opted for a balance between younger talent and more experienced players as he continues to uphold the strong development philosophy of the club.
Sime left no stone unturned in his quest for the best of the state-s best young footballing talent and welcomes six new players alongside the core of last year-s squad that finished second in the National Youth League, four points behind Central Coast Mariners.
“I think it-s tremendous for the club that there-s certainly a depth in Queensland football,” he said.
“The structure at the QAS [Queensland Academy of Sport] is certainly working and I think the rewards are coming through.
“Rado Vidosic and myself made the decision to go young and that-s the vision of the club, as well as trying to cover all parts of Queensland – from Cairns, to Townsville, to Gladstone, to Rockhampton and everywhere in between.
“Since May, I-ve probably been to well in excess of 80 games of all various levels but mostly youth levels.
“It-s been very encouraging and at training, we-ve probably looked at 150 kids.
“It-s been a bit hectic but full marks to the staff and to everyone who participated.”
The Roar-s full-time youth players Corey Brown, George Lambadaridis and Nick Fitzgerald will continue to play a large role in the squad while defender Jason Geria, a regular in the Qantas Young Socceroos set-up, will skipper the side and Ross Archibald has been named vice-captain.
“Jason Geria is a player who I rate very, very highly,” Sime said.
“You need someone who is going to lead the way, along with Ross Archibald who I-m expecting big things from this season.
“They-re both currently training with the first team and I-m really happy with the two of them.”
According to Sime, the club-s National Youth League set-up is “second to none”.
“Looking at the structure of the club, we-ve now appointed a full-time physio for the youth team and a full-time football conditioning coach for the youth team,” he said.
“[Assistant coach] Joel Smith does an excellent job – he-s very keen, he-s very eager and very ambitious and Ryan Timmins does a wonderful job as team manager.
“Everyone has got a job to do and everyone is really keen and eager to develop the kids at this club.
“It-s all about development – you-ll hear me saying this all season because it-s okay to win but we must develop and if we perform well, I-m sure we-ll get the just rewards.
“I also have to give a special thanks to Olympic Football Club, who have been our base and they do a tremendous job for us.”
Brisbane Roar Youth will open their 2012/13 campaign away to Perth Glory on Saturday, 20 October before their first home match against Melbourne Victory Youth on Sunday, 28 October.

Goalkeepers: Nicholas TUBBS, Fraser CHALMERS

"Sized for the 16. The combination of 16-gauge ammunition and a fast to point over and under shotgun is very likely the ideal combination for upland game. And when it comes to over and unders, none match the reputation for durability like a Citori. This model is built on a receiver that is sized to match 16 gauge shells. It features beautiful engraving artwork and stock checkering that provide updated style to the timeless Citori design.
What makes it a White Lightning? The natural color steel receiver and trigger guard are protected from corrosion by a durable coating process called a “silver nitride” finish, offering similar protection to bluing. Just with a uniquely elegant and attractive look. The “lightning” part of the name is attributed to the rounded stock pistol grip that allows you to position your hand at the same, solid place for each shot, thus offering better control for fast-flying upland game and clay targets. Sharp checkering ensure a secure hold.

"Yes, this is possible because there are related problems such as B. Accidents requiring blood and ordinary blood cannot be obtained. No, because this is not a disease, but a genetic trait that can only be alarming when a pregnant woman and a man do not know about the blood group of the unborn child.
The story features a four-year-old boy at the centre of the story.
The Rhesus factor (Rh) is a natural protein found on the surface of red blood cells. If your blood contains protein, you are Rh-positive. If your blood lacks protein, you are Rh-negative. Rh-positive is the most common blood type.
However, the story’s core lies in the journey of young Swarnaja (Koel Mullick). Who works as a radio jockey but has “golden blood” with a rhesus factor. He receives a strange phone call while running his program under the catchy name “Jaa Icche Tai” (whatever you want).
On the other hand, the voice seemed to belong to a child asking how to send a letter to God. This sets the tone of tension. Svarnaya decided to solve the problem with the call, and the caller and his story started cutting, changing and moving different songs.
It is a hyperlinked multi-story film that challenges the concepts of time and eternity in the lives of several Calcutta people. The story of the anchor is about a strange and lonely artist (Subhashish Mukherjee). And a newspaper clipping collector who has a magic paint box paints spiral circles on his photos or newspaper sheets. By marking entry and exit points for the viewer, who checks the drawing or clippings. Newspaper and went out to enter it.
Her second film, Rainbow Jelly (2018), presents an original perspective on the relationship between and between food, fantasy, and 13-year-old boy Ghoton, who has an IQ and was expelled from public school. It’s a modern tale that uses surrealism to weave a beautiful tale of how food magically changes the life of a raped, neglected and abused orphan who is also the heir to a secret treasure.
Rawkto Rawoshyo is a story of human conflict in a kind, sophisticated woman:
Who allows others to lead and prefer to follow. The real value of this philosophy is shrouded in suspense, murder, thrill and more. The entire film is told in the voice of Swarnaja’s younger brother, Babay (Rwitobroto Mukherjee) who falls in love with his sister and is very worried about her.
Ghosal emphasized Svarnaja’s human values as a very kind young woman who always wanted to help others. For example, there are recurring scenes where Zvarnaya allows someone else to get off the elevator before he does or steps aside to help someone. She is very vulnerable, which causes a lot of suffering from a brief affair with Shammo (Chandan Roy Sanyal), the man she met at the gym, and how she gets caught up in another exploitation scheme that she sticks to because he doesn’t know the truth.
The rhesus factor in Swarnaja’s blood led to the opening of a large-scale international extortion trade:
With children and surrogate children. The director has effectively combined all these seemingly disparate factors to coalesce into a captivating thriller. That essentially revolves around how Swarnaja’s path changes from her innocent and benevolent generosity. To worldly wisdom and a determined woman. Who rises to the challenge of discovering some truth. About himself, he lives through a mysterious phone call that takes him out of his comfort zone.
The film also pays homage to a single mother. The threads range from the golden blood factor to a brief love affair. To a mother and daughter reunion, different emotions, relationships, betrayal, love and motherhood. The director wore a red sweater that Svarnaja’s late mother gave him as a gift, key to his secret. There are also mentions of certain qualities of rice that help catch criminals.",<urn:uuid:011cd737-ce86-42f3-b0b7-9ffea21661ae>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://bulletnews.net/rawkto-rawhoshyo-review-can-rare-blood-types-affect-ones-life/,2024-02-20T23:13:59Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9594742655754089,851,1.491093635559082,1

"The issue of discrimination in lending is complex and systemic
Whether occurring overtly or otherwise, it is a hindrance to small business owners and adversely impacts communities. “This goes back a ways and it’s not just lending,” says Business Impact NW, SVP and Senior Loan Officer, Roland Chaiton.
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 was established to protect borrowers against discrimination due to “race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or because you get public assistance.” Yet it still occurs. A report released by Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business this January found that despite the recent “explosive growth” of Latino-owned businesses, “only 28% of Latino business owners receive the full funding amount they apply for, compared to 49% of white business owners” (MarketWatch).
Similarly, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 was established to prevent discrimination in the buying and renting of homes. However today Latino, African American and other minority communities are twice as likely to have their home loan application denied (WUNC). An article published by the Chicago Tribune just last year titled, Modern-day redlining: How banks block people of color from homeownership, reported “proprietary credit score algorithms to have a discriminatory impact on borrowers of color” (Chicago Tribune).
So if systems are in place to protect individuals against discrimination, why does it still occur?
When applying for capital to buy a house or start a business, lenders have to have a system in place to determine whether a borrower qualifies and to protect their investment. “Since we are providing a financial product, unfortunately we have to evaluate clients based on financial metrics,” says Business Impact NW’s Chief Lending Officer Sunil Nair. Among the criteria considered, include the borrower’s credit history, along with their debt-to-income ratio, or their assets and liabilities. Loan rates and fees may compensate for a higher risk loan, but the reason a client may have less liquid assets to begin with, is often systemic.
For communities who have been historically disenfranchised, barriers to capital are exacerbated by generational wealth
Consider a borrower whose parent or grandparent was unable to access a loan because they were new to the country and couldn’t find a co-signer, or they lived in a district that was “redlined” and banks were not allowed or advised against lending there. This parent or grandparent had less of an opportunity to build wealth, leaving fewer assets (lower net worth, ownership of property, liquidity, etc.) to their children and grandchildren than someone who was able to acquire a loan, buy a house and start a business.
Redlining “started with the Great Depression,” reports Seattle’s PBS station
“Rampant foreclosures had left lenders fearful and so the federal government devised a solution. It would encourage banks to get back into the business of loaning money to would-be homebuyers by developing maps that would show where their mortgages were most likely, and least likely to be paid in full. It was called ‘redlining’ and the aim was economic development. The result was economic discrimination” (KCTS9).
“People in the Central District, they couldn’t get home mortgages. They couldn’t get loans. The zones were actually depicted on maps. It was pure, outright discrimination going on,” states Chaiton. Lenders in the City of Seattle practiced redlining until June of 1977. (Seattle.gov, KingCounty.gov). KCTS reports that people who grew up in neighborhoods historically redlined in the decade following its demise, earn less money today than individuals who grew in neighborhoods “marked in blue.” (Interested in learning more about the historical implications of “redlining?” Read the Washington Post’s, Redlining was banned 50 years ago. It’s still hurting minorities today.)
According to an article from the Brookings Institution published in the early 2000s, “Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) as we know them took root approximately 25 years ago in the fertile soil of bank redlining, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), and the federal government’s shift away from its short-lived Great Society strategy.” CDFIs were established to provide microlending to marginalized entrepreneurs and because they have a mission to uphold, they are better equipped to provide loans to those historically disenfranchised and take on more risks than a traditional bank.
Jim Thomas founded the Seattle Economic Development Fund (SEDF) in 1996 in Seattle’s Central District
At the time its dba was Community Capital Development and it was established to assist the community’s marginalized entrepreneurs. “The founder made a place where they could come and they were not going to get discriminated against. He made sure of that with the staff,” recalls Chaiton. Continuing in Thomas’s legacy, Business Impact NW, SEDF’s current dba, provides race and gender training for its staff and works tirelessly to uphold its mission to “grow businesses that create jobs in underserved communities.” Chaiton adds, “It has a history of being an organization that will not tolerate discrimination.”
If a borrower has been turned down by a bank because of circumstantial credit issues, a poor credit score, or lack of liquid assets, the worst outcome is that they fall trap to predatory lending (learn more about the risks of predatory lending in this blog series by Business Impact NW). Applying for a loan through a CDFI is the best alternative, especially for borrowers who have experienced discrimination, or the historical ramifications of discrimination. (The FDIC identifies three types of lending discrimination: overt discrimination, disparate treatment and disparate impact.)
Loans approved by Business Impact NW are done so in a committee-fashion, so there are several sets of eyes on the application, thus eliminating the possibility of a singular loan officer engaging in overt discriminatory practices. Business Impact NW’s “mission loan” allows the CDFI to step out of the rigid credit metrics, use mission terms instead of financial terms, and serve underserved entrepreneurs without working capital. “We provide two to three mission loans a quarter,” reports Nair. If borrowers are able to bring in additional guarantors or partnerships, that is another way the organization is able to circumnavigate the required collateral and credit criteria that are systemically discriminatory.
Business Impact NW also provides coaching and loan readiness training that guides borrowers through the lending process and helps them to better understand the conditions of their loan. The Washington Women’s Business Center is a branch of Business Impact NW committed to serving female entrepreneurs while the Veterans Business Outreach Center works with veterans and their families. While the impact of discriminatory practices are still felt today, a silver lining can be found in the CDFIs that are working to serve those who have been historically disenfranchised.

"With Plans to Open in 2022, Shell Cracker Plant Begins Hiring
LISBON, Ohio – Dakota Schreffler worked as a railroad conductor for two years, but the opportunities were sparse with no benefits or retirement.
Then, the 24-year-old from East Palestine happened to view a Facebook post about Thursday’s hiring event at the Columbiana County OhioMeansJobs offices for various positions at Royal Dutch Shell’s Petrochemical complex in Monaca, Pa.
Schreffler registered with OhioMeansJobs, filled out paperwork and a questionairre, and then spoke with a hiring manager. Within an hour, he had a new job as a rail mechanic overseeing maintainence of freight equipment and rail and tank cars.
“I needed to find somewhere where it’s concrete,” he says. “I have benefits, 401k, all those things which they offer here.”
Schreffler was one of several applicants offered positions from Petroleum Service Corp. pending a drug test and background check. Positions were open for rail administrators, CDL drivers, loaders, lab technicians and rail mechanics. About 53 attended the event during its first hour.
Petroleum Service is a Shell subcontractor that provides logistics services to the ethane processing plant, and plans to staff between 150 and 180 employees at peak capacity, said Jason Martin, the company’s regional operations manager.
He says there are 54 of his group currently on the worksite, where previous experience is not required.
“I think just just driving that confidence down to people that even if you don’t have experience in the petrochemical world, you may have other skill sets that we can mold into what we’re doing there,” Martin said.
Martin said starting wages are $17 to $19 an hour for entry-level positions at the 386-acre site in Beaver County.
“As folks get qualified or would be promoted into leadership positions, those wages would continue to go up,” he said.
For those hired, paid training consists of classroom instruction and regulatory training. There will be on-the-job training, shadowing a veteran employee.
Martin said he has been hiring for Petroleum Service Corporation the past six months, and will continue to conduct interviews over the next several months to a year to reach the peak employment. So far, he’s interviewed hundreds of potential candidates.
“After this initial work group that we’ve just hired, as we digest that wave and you get those folks trained up, then we’ll be looking to bring on additional folks thereafter,” he said.
Karl Wuttur, a charter bus driver who said he expects to be laid off at the end of the month, has his CDL license and applied to be part of the Petroleum crew.
“I live about seven and a half miles from the plant,” he said. “If I could get on full-time at that plant, I would just stay there.”
Should those coming an hour away or further apply for these jobs? It’s a decision Martin said should be pondered by each applicant.
“I typically see folks that will commute anywhere between 45 minutes to an hour,” he said. “Anything beyond that, it tends to be a struggle to have that family-life balance.”
Schreffler’s father works for Laborers’ Union Local 1058 out of Pittsburgh and was one of thousands constructing the Monaca plant.
“I’ve seen it basically when it was just dirt up to now,” Schreffler said. “So it’s been pretty crazy to watch. It’s impressive. It’s quite the place.”
Martin, who grew up in West Virginia seeing the abandoned coal mines, says the potential of the Shell cracker plant is quite a benefit to western Pennsylvania.
A 2020 study by Robert Morris University reports the complex will produce between $260 million and $846 million in annual economic activity – the net value of wages, benefits, and related spending – for Beaver County alone. The annual economic impact in the 10-county region that includes Lawrence County is projected at approximately $3.3 billion.
When fully staffed, the entire petrochemical complex is expected to employ 600 full-time workers. The plant, which converts ethane gas from the Utica and Marcellus shale plays into plastic feedstock, is to begin operations sometime this year.
“I think this is going to allow people’s children to remain in the area and have good opportunities,” Martin said.

"For all those interested in the field of production, understanding what is a capital resource is very important. In this article, we shall discuss it in detail with the help of some interesting examples.
For manufacturing any product, we need some goods which have certain properties that are essential for ensuring the durability and utility of the product. These goods which are used in production of new goods and services are defined as ‘capital resources’. In order to achieve production targets and deliver high quality products to the customers, we should have these resources in plenty. Any shortage can bring the entire production process to a stand still. Because of this, the sales and profits of a company are affected.
Importance of Capital Resource
Capital resources are considered to be a part of the entire production process. They are useful even in businesses which do not offer goods, but provide services to clients. In fact, they are the inputs which any organization have to use for getting the desired products. Over the years, customer expectations from products have risen tremendously. Today’s buyer wants innovative, new and technologically advanced products which provide real value for the money paid. So, naturally, those firms which are not able to produce such products will lag behind in the race of acquiring new customers. Therefore, the key is to improve the resources used for production purposes and make them more technologically advanced.
Safeguarding the available capital resources is as important as improving their quality. A company invests a big sum in acquiring and developing these resources and so, any kind of wastage will result in heavy financial losses and interruptions in the production process. So, keeping these valuable resources safely and under inspection of trained professionals is very necessary.
Are All Assets Capital Resources?
The answer for this question is NO. Many people might be confused why not all assets come under this category. Here is the explanation:
- An asset should be such that it is useful in the process of production for a very long period. Technically, any goods which cannot be used consistently for making new goods cannot be considered in this category
- Capital resource is that asset with a production unit which comes handy in storing finished goods which are ready for sale. This is yet another important property
- Cash in hand is not considered as many experts describe it as the thing required to buy a capital resource rather than a capital resource in itself
Examples of Capital Resources
The following are some of the best examples
Manufacturing machinery: Manufacturing machinery can be used to produce goods for a long period (several years) provided it is well maintained and serviced.
Warehouse: A warehouse can be used for the storage of finished or ready for sale goods.
Land: Land is a long servicing source of natural resources.
Power Generators: A power generator is needed in keeping the goods producing machines working.
Buildings: If services are provided to customers in buildings, then they are included in the category of capital resources.
Maintenance equipment: Maintenance equipment is required for ensuring smooth operations of the machines producing goods.
List of Capital Resources
- Cell phone
- Fax machines
- Free weights
Capital resources like plant and machinery are useful in the computation of manufacturing overhead costs which help a factory know its profits. The above mentioned examples must have helped you in knowing the exact concept and its importance. Apart from preservation of such resources, it is also essential to make best use of them for meeting the orders of items placed by customers. So, try to understand this concept and use the information in the right way. All the best!",<urn:uuid:c4eb9d99-6c0b-4094-bde9-b73e4f88afe9>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://businesszeal.com/examples-of-capital-resources,2024-02-20T23:08:05Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9531822204589844,723,2.79477596282959,3

"AN ODE TO … THE SPORTS BOOK
Sunday morning. A day of worship and prayer. We rush to our sacred space, full of optimism and faith. It’s a new beginning. We have learned from last week’s transgressions and developed a new strategy and plan. We seek more than salvation. We want growth; we want gain. The promised bounty awaits … as long as we choose wisely. We just have to get there on time. It is not the disapproving looks of parishioners we are trying to avoid if we are late — we have to get our bets in on time. The church forgives; the sportsbook doesn’t.
Inside, a bouquet of cigarettes, cologne and simmering hot dogs envelops us. We scan the others gathered here today. Based on the held glances and nods, we know it is more than the financial allure of parlaying an entertainment source into an income supplement or a life-changing windfall that brought us here. It is the opportunity to make connections and build rapport with friends, colleagues and even strangers, to be in a congregation where everyone is accepted and all opinions are heard.
The monitors stare back at us. They are windows to our future and will show us our fate. We stand aghast before the twinkling board. The letters and numbers blur together, flashing like stars. Our adrenalin surges. Sweat pushes through, adding to the scent swirling around us. We dig out our play sheet, deciphering our notes to match the patterns gleaming from above.
At the counter, the indifferent stare of the ticket writer shakes our resolve. We lower our eyes to our wrinkled play sheet and speak the language of this hallowed place. His fingers dance over the keys, culminating in a dollar total. We remove the sweat-damp wad of bills buried in our pocket and straighten the requested total, pushing it forward like an offering. In return we receive a solitary slip of white paper. Satisfaction shoots through us. We nod in appreciation. This is the one. With a single wager we are no longer just a spectator. We have a role in the drama about to unfold.
The game starts. We savor each play. Every twist and turn is an affirmation of our choice or a conspiracy to steal our boon. Of course we want the money, but more than anything we want to be right, to watch the scenario we professed come to fruition, to puff our chest out and say, “I told you so.” Only seconds remain. We move closer to the screen, as if we could help if needed. A sudden reversal transpires. Our probability plummets. The monitor confirms the unfortunate outcome. Our head slumps forward in defeat. We steady ourselves and rise with humility and grace. The cheers of those who only moments ago were losers remind us that one person’s bad beat is another’s luck box cover. We raise our eyes to the heavens and search the board.

"Divorce is so often characterized in society as negative and traumatizing. Truthfully, the traditional litigated model sends the two sides to opposite corners, setting up emotionally charged faceoffs, with the children caught in the middle. While domestic problems that culminate in divorce have usually existed for some time during the marriage, the litigated model exposes them during proceedings in a way that is painful, public and emotionally damaging to all involved, especially the children.
Fortunately, in Texas there are less public and less expensive divorce options that arguably offer more beneficial results, providing closure and continuation for all involved. Finding experienced collaborative divorce legal representation in the Dallas area can offer couples the option to find solutions outside of the courtroom that suit their family’s unique needs.
There are many ways to dissolve a marriage in Texas outside of traditional litigation. Each one presents ways that both sides can come together to divide community property and make decisions regarding the best arrangements for the children. About 95% of all divorce cases in Texas are settled by agreement. Some options include:
- Collaborative Law
- “Kitchen Table” Settlements
- Do-it-Yourself Divorce
In comparing the differences between collaborative, mediated or litigated approaches to divorce, it is important consider who makes the final decisions. It is the judge who makes all decisions in litigated divorce.
Mediation does offer alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods to resolve differences, but it is often at the judge’s urging as a means to avoid a courtroom appearance or speed up proceedings. In fact, mediation usually happens after the divorce has been filed.
Collaborative divorce, however, brings to the table not only both spouses and their attorneys, but mental health professionals and financial advisors, to come up with ways of restructuring the family post-divorce so that the needs of everyone are met. This positive approach eliminates the zero-sum game that can dominate a divorce proceeding, and it can keep the divorce out of court altogether.
The Uniform Collaborative Law Act
In the past 25 years, there has been a growing body of family law professionals who have advocated for more peaceful, collaborative approaches to divorce. In July of 2009, the Uniform Law Commission proposed the Uniform Collaborative Law Act. Texas became the second state in the nation to enact the statute in 2011 as Tex.

"Air pollution and agriculture today
Agriculture still suffers huge financial losses each year from air pollution, but is now itself being examined with increasing vigilance as a source of pollution. Controlled fire has always been used by farmers for the preservation of food, for the destruction of pests and diseases, and for the disposal of wastes. Disposal of wastes—including straw, stubble, tree prunings, dead trees, and brush clearing on rangeland—produces smoke, odors, dust and air-borne particulate matter that is increasingly objectionable (but not necessarily harmful) to city dwellers as they continue to move out into rural areas. On the other hand, people-produced damage to farm crops from photo-chemical pollutants (resulting mostly from automobile exhaust) often occurs in the absence of analytical instruments that show first signs of air pollution. It is therefore important that there be continued surveillance of air pollution damage to agriculture, as well as measurement of amount and effects of agriculturally-produced pollution. This article discusses legislation, regulations and control aspects of the air pollution problem on a statewide basis, and offers a course of action for the future.",<urn:uuid:dc326d6d-f0ba-4943-883d-660a5c6ee2b8>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://calag.ucanr.edu/Archive/?article=ca.v022n09p8,2024-02-20T21:46:37Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9435660243034363,232,3.1567587852478027,3
"Men and Emotions: How to Be Vulnerable as a Man and Why
Table of Contents
Growing up, many men were conditioned not to show their emotions. “Be a man.” “Men don’t cry.” “Don’t be such a weiner!” These words were echoed in the ears of little boys before they even understood their own emotions.
In this article, we’ll explore how to be vulnerable and the importance of vulnerability for men.
What is vulnerability?
Vulnerability is choosing to let your defenses down in a bid to connect with other people. It’s exposing ourselves to new experiences, feelings, and emotions. Vulnerability is what makes us humans. It is that invisible connection that keeps us in tune with our emotions. Also, it helps us connect to other humans on an emotional level.
For instance, when you choose to tell someone “I love you” for the first time, it requires a great deal of vulnerability. This is because you are opening yourself up to the possibility of them saying they don’t love you back or outrightly rejecting your love.
In a popular TED Talk titled The Power of Vulnerability, Dr. Brene Brown, a vulnerability researcher and storyteller, perfectly captures the meaning of vulnerability when she says, “Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren’t always comfortable, but they are never weakness.”
This shows that vulnerability is a strength, not a trait representing weakness.
The dire consequences of “being a man”
Society believes being a man means you cannot show your emotions. It means you should always put up a bold exterior, no matter how sad, depressed, or anxious you might be feeling inside.
But what society fails to add is this: the more we choose to suppress and hide these emotions, the more likely it becomes to develop into mental health disorders.
Bottling your emotions up may lead to:
Why is it important for men to be vulnerable?
Before we explore the reasons why vulnerability is a strength, we should ask an important question: why do men hide their feelings?
As mentioned earlier, this is primarily due to societal conditioning. All our lives, we are constantly reminded that there is strength in being “tough.” So, as we grow to become men, we learn to hide our emotions behind the cloak of fearlessness and strength.
We smile when all we really want to do is cry. We keep silent even when we want to scream so badly. Interestingly, anger is a perfect example of how men express their feelings.
The same goes for discussions around depression. Even though women are more likely to report cases of depression, a 2013 study showed that 30.6% of men will experience major depressive episodes in their lifetime.
Unfortunately, because lesser men are speaking out about their struggles with depression and anxiety, the suicide rate among men in America is four times higher than that of women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But because we don’t show our emotions or talk about them doesn’t mean we don’t have them. In fact, men process emotions the same way women do, but thanks to social conditioning, gender stereotypes, and toxic masculinity, men are more likely to suppress these emotions.
When men choose to be vulnerable, they can finally:
- Become their authentic selves
- Connect with their emotions better
- Build better and more honest relationships
- Face their biggest fears
- Become more honest about how something or someone makes them feel
Learning to become vulnerable is teaching yourself how to express your feelings.
How to be vulnerable as a man: 4 practical tips
To become vulnerable, you need to take active, conscious steps. It is a process of allowing yourself to express your emotions and be emotionally intimate, no matter how scary or different it seems.
At first, this will be extremely difficult because we have been taught as men never to show our emotions. But it’s definitely worth it.
Here are some ways you can learn to be vulnerable with your emotions:
1. Always be honest about how you feel
The first step to being vulnerable is to be honest about how you feel. It is natural for you to feel sad as a man or for you to feel anxious about something or someone. But rather than shut it down or bottle it up, open up to someone about these emotions.
It is also vital to accept that it is totally fine to feel this way. After accepting this fact, try to figure out why you feel this way.
Then, most importantly, express your feelings and emotions healthily. A licensed therapist can teach you how to do it.
2. Face your fears
It can be challenging to be vulnerable because it requires a great deal of courage. It requires courage to confess your love for the first time. It requires courage to demand respect from someone.
But whatever it is you are scared of doing, just do it anyway.
3. Find a therapeutic hobby
Did you know that doing something you love can help you focus more on your emotions? It could be as simple as walking your dog, exercising, reading a book, or watching a movie.
Whatever it is, it would give you time to reflect on your emotions, understand them, and express them clearly and productively.
4. Talk to a therapist
There’s nothing wrong with seeking emotional help as a man. In our societies, we have created a stigma around men and their mental health troubles.
But seeing a therapist is one of the most effective ways for men to talk and deal with their deepest emotions.
Online therapy at Calmerry is an opportunity to learn about your feelings and how you can deal with these emotions in healthier and more productive ways. It ultimately allows you to be more vulnerable without the fear of judgment.
Again, it is essential to remember that there is absolutely nothing wrong with seeing a therapist. In fact, choosing to see a therapist early enough can prevent a simple problem from turning into a complicated mental health condition.
A closing note
Learning to be vulnerable involves a heavy dose of hard work. Set realistic expectations. Avoid beating yourself up if you fail to adequately express how you feel to someone. There’s always another chance to try again.
Constantly remind yourself that you are doing a great job. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and emotional vulnerability doesn’t happen in one week.
Give yourself time.

The existing alignment of the Caltrain tracks was established by the Southern Pacific railroad's Bayshore Cutoff, a series of trestles and tunnels built at the turn of the 20th century to provide direct rail access to San Francisco (shown under construction in the 1905 photo at right, looking south). The marshes between the tracks and the original shoreline were filled in with rubble from the 1906 earthquake, and became known as the Baylands (see overview map, as well as track maps for mileposts 5 and 6). In its heyday, this area served as a massive railroad yard, complete with engine roundhouse. The tracks were shut down in 1982, and all that remains of the yard is a vast expanse of soil contaminated with lead and oil, forming the western portion of the 650-acre site now known as the Brisbane Baylands.
The cleanup and restoration of the Brisbane Baylands is to be followed by redevelopment, by a city eager to grow its tax base. The Brisbane Baylands Community Advisory Group maintains a nice library of documents relating to the site, including a 2008 overview of the planned development. The Brisbane Baylands project is well into its CEQA environmental review process, and all the alternatives that have been defined for detailed study in the EIR involve a nearly total redevelopment of the former railroad yard.
Most of the stakeholders in this process seem oblivious to the possible implications of the high speed rail project for Brisbane. The HSR scoping comments submitted by the City of Brisbane never even mention two very important words: maintenance facility.
The San Francisco Maintenance Facility
The high speed rail system requires train maintenance and storage facilities in the vicinity of its major terminals. This topic came to light during the California High Speed Rail Authority's August 2009 meeting, when the board chairman noted that the requirements for such HSR maintenance facilities were not generally understood by the public, and asked for memoranda describing these facilities to be released.
On the peninsula corridor, a train maintenance and storage facility must be placed as close as possible to the San Francisco terminal to minimize the amount of non-revenue train movements between the facility and the passenger terminal. The CHSRA's technical memorandum 5.1 on heavy maintenance facilities describes the following characteristics for the facility to be located near San Francisco:
- 84 acres
- 1081 ft wide
- 27 storage tracks, 8 shop tracks, 2 cleaning tracks, 4 ""other"" tracks
90 to 108 acres is a lot of land, a strip over 1000 ft wide by nearly a mile long. The CHSRA additionally desires the access tracks to such facility to be about 4000 ft long, to allow trains to leave the main corridor at about 100 mph and enter the maintenance facility without forcing other trains to slow down. This concept is similar to a freeway exit ramp, and would likely be grade-separated from the main line through a suitable arrangement of flyovers. The total length of the facility would be over two miles.
Site Location Criteria
Ideally, again according to the CHSRA memoranda, the facility should be located preferably within 1.5 miles of the San Francisco terminal, desirably within 3 miles, and exceptionally further than 3 miles. The good news for Brisbane is that it is further than 6 miles from the Transbay Transit Center in San Francisco, seemingly outside the acceptable range of this criterion. The bad news is that there are no 100-acre parcels of flat, open land available within those 6 miles.
While the CHSRA's memoranda never mention Brisbane by name, the location of the San Francisco Terminal Storage / Maintenance Facility (TSMF) is nearly certain to be:
The Brisbane Baylands.
Curiously enough, a February 2009 visit to the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce by the CHSRA's Quentin Kopp does not seem to have touched upon all the implications of high speed rail for Brisbane, since it was reported as having been ""well received."" Let's see how it goes after Brisbane wakes up-- see the realistically-scaled overlay of the CHSRA's yard plan shown above, or better yet, see for yourself in Google Earth.
NOTE: This post will be updated continuously, as warranted by additional information or new events relating to Brisbane.",<urn:uuid:8836394c-7385-41f0-8d91-b5c0ee4b80fc>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://caltrain-hsr.blogspot.com/2009/09/focus-on-brisbane.html,2024-02-20T22:32:01Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9645379781723022,867,2.5456366539001465,3
"- It keeps high-speed rail out. In discussions of Caltrain electrification and the slow
beating-around-the-bush process that is leading up to the certification
of the electrification EIR, high-speed rail has become the central issue. Electrification is viewed in some quarters as the camel's nose under the tent, so a renewed push is underway to ensure that all the alternatives other than electrification have been duly considered.
- It keeps unsightly high-voltage poles and wiring at bay, preserving views and presumably residential property values in some of the most affluent areas in the nation.
- It spares Caltrain, the perennially funding-starved agency, the burden of spending $785 million of scarce capital dollars to string wires over its tracks.
There's only one little problem: it doesn't really exist.
Okay, almost. There do exist a handful of hybrid DMUs in Japan. These advanced technology trains, instantly knowable to any city staffer via a simple Google search (keyword hint: 'hybrid DMU'), operate in Japan. The fleet numbers three cars on one line, and ten cars spread among four other lines. Each car seats about 45 and tops out at 60 mph. Their power output is less than a Chevy Tahoe hybrid's.
The Law of Diesel Trains
To understand why the hybrid DMU will never work for the peninsula corridor, look no further than the laws of physics. What Caltrain needs is a singular focus on better service: quicker trips, more frequent stops, higher capacity, and less waiting for the next train. That requires big, fast trains with one key quality: punchy acceleration, precisely the reason why the EMU (electric multiple unit) powered by high-voltage overhead lines was invented and perfected. To achieve high acceleration, the laws of physics dictate high power and low weight.
A diesel train makes all its power on board and sends it to electric motors that drive the wheels; it is essentially a rolling mini power plant. The nicest and newest rolling mini power plants used by Caltrain today generate 3,600 horsepower for a million-pound train. In metric units, that's about 6 kW/ton, and as any Caltrain rider can attest, it doesn't exactly pin you to your seat. The problem is that rolling mini power plants are heavy, and if you want more power, you'll need to haul around even more weight. This is the Law of Diesel Trains, directly derived from Newton's Laws of Motion. More weight does little to help with acceleration, so diesel basically can't scale up.
The EMU, on the other hand, doesn't schlep around a rolling mini power plant. Its electricity is generated off-board by a real power plant, of the PG&E variety. The electric grid, hooked up to gigawatts of generating capacity, can provide essentially limitless power to a train. That endows a typical EMU (of the sort available off-the-shelf from many manufacturers) with a power-to-weight ratio of about 12 kW/ton, or double the giddy-up of a diesel train. For short bursts of acceleration, high-voltage EMUs can briefly exceed their continuous power rating and draw even more power, hitting up to 18 kW/ton. For those still keeping track, that's triple the acceleration of Caltrain. For reference, BART cars achieve a respectable 15 kW/ton.
So what do the Japanese know about hybrid DMUs that we don't? Most importantly, they do not claim zippy acceleration as a benefit. The hybrid DMU does three things for them: save about 10% on fuel, cut down nitrous oxide emissions, and cut the noise of an idling train down to an electric whisper. Beyond those benefits, the 'D' in DMU makes it follow the Law of Diesel Trains. The Japanese hybrid DMUs manage barely 5 kW/ton, probably because they haul around not just a mini power plant, but also big heavy batteries. Here in the US, more stringent crashworthiness standards would make such trains even heavier and their performance even more anemic.
The inescapable conclusions are thus:
- Hybrid DMUs provide only about one third of the acceleration required to enable meaningful Caltrain service improvements. A simple technical litmus test for future Caltrain rolling stock is the power-to-weight ratio, required to be at least 12 to 15 kW/ton. Hybrid DMUs don't qualify.
- Hybrid DMU technology has never been scaled up beyond the size of a bus.
- Hybrid DMU technology inherently cannot be scaled up to achieve higher power-to-weight and acceleration in large (600 - 1000 passenger) configurations.",<urn:uuid:b32d55d1-af84-4ff9-9890-fd653531cde8>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://caltrain-hsr.blogspot.com/2012/03/hybrid-dmu-unicorn-of-rails.html?showComment=1330978515557,2024-02-20T22:06:53Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9338387846946716,973,2.9404587745666504,3
"Here at Campus Living Villages, we aim to give as much support to our students as possible. We know that many of our students may be prioritising study over sleep this exam period, so we’d like to give you some valuable advice that we think you should consider. Here are our tips to ensure you get a good quality sleep during the exam period.
The Key to Good Sleep During Exams
Exam time is around the corner. For many of us, it’s a time when sleep gets put on the back burner. It may seem like a good idea at the time, but those all-nighters can start to take a toll. Poor sleep negatively impacts memory, creativity and impairs your judgement. It’s a downward spiral effect you want to avoid during exam week. Truth be told, sleeping may even be more important than studying. Here is the key to getting good sleep during exams.
Aim to get most of your study done during the day
Studying to the point of burnout is never a good idea. If you can, stick to an exam study schedule of 9-5 during study week. This should be a reasonable amount of time to cover the topics within your exam, mainly if you’ve managed to keep up with classwork during the semester. Try not to over-study as this can make you tired and irritable and even make it hard to concentrate (even with adequate sleep).
If you can’t follow the 9-5 structure?
Aim to get a few hours in where you can throughout the day. If it means waking up early, you may need to adjust your sleep schedule and begin prioritising earlier nights. Time-blocking will also help you to keep on track. Click here to find out how to study effectively with time-blocking.
Exercise regularly (during the day)
Regular exercise is proven to help sleep. Make a conscious effort to work out during the day, and you thank yourself come bedtime. All those endorphins do wonders for your mental health and well-being. Try to avoid exercising for at least three hours before bed, as this will only disrupt your sleep. Exercise will also help you to relieve any feelings of stress and anxiety during exam time. Take a walk through your university accommodation to help to clear your mind.
Allow yourself to wind down at night
Do your best to avoid studying for at least two hours before bed. Instead, use this time to relax, unwind and focus on something other than study. Create a relaxing bedtime routine. You could have a bath and listen to some calming music. Get into some cosy pj's and read a book. Allow your mind to drift away from all things study related.
Avoid drinking too much caffeine
Caffeine is a known sleep disrupter. If you can, limit your caffeine to the mornings. This will ensure that you won’t be kept up at night. If you’re a real coffee lover, try swapping your usual caffeinated cup for decaf - it’s not that bad. Or, opt for herbal tea.
For those in shared accommodation
We know living in student accommodation can be lots of fun, but sometimes your roommates may be a little noisy at bedtime. Maybe they’ve finished their exams, and you still have three to go? Here are some suggestions for you.
- Openly talk to your roommates about keeping the noise down at night while preparing for your exams.
- See if they would also like to adopt a similar sleep schedule to you during exam time.
- Wear earplugs if things are too noisy for you
- Wear a sleep mask
Aim to get at least 8-9 hours of sleep each night
Use sleep as your secret weapon during exam week. Sleep is truly the best medicine. A night of good quality sleep will help to improve your mood, memory and recall! We think allowing yourself to have 8-9 hours of sleep per night is the highest form of self-love. Sleep deprivation makes you feel like a zombie, and who wants that? Drink a cup of chamomile tea and make sleep your #1.

"Thermal rolls are a special paper type that is manufactured with specialty coating that aids in inkless printing. On application of heat to the coating, a clear image is formed on the paper with no requirement for ribbons or inks. The coating usually turns black on heating, which, in turn, transfers the image to the paper. Thermal paper is the key component of thermal paper printing, which is considered one of the most economical printing technologies owing to its low energy consumption and low maintenance cost.
Thermal rolls are composed of a base paper, an undercoating and a thermal coating. Both coatings are provided on the same side of the paper. The thermal coating helps in the printing process, whereas the undercoating helps in improving the base paper to suit it for printing and help in creating a smoother and high-quality finish. Sometimes additional coating is also applied on the paper for protective purposes. Based on the composition of the principal characteristics, different quality types of thermal papers are available.
Reliability, durability and high-definition images are characteristics of printing on thermal paper. Printing on thermal paper is faster than other modes of printing technologies, and this helps in high-volume printouts. Again, the printing involved is quieter, and so high-output printing is a smooth experience. The print images on thermal paper are of high quality and are also capable of handling high-quality barcode scans. Apart from being economical and low in energy consumption for the printer, thermal papers offer great flexibility with respect to size. Different formats of printing are supported by thermal papers. The images do not fade or smudge over time and last for a longer period of time. Another advantage of using thermal paper for printing is the low maintenance cost as there are fewer movements involved in such printers.",<urn:uuid:c637df48-5124-481c-89bc-28c26883f180>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://carlnkyle.co.ke/product/79mm-x-35mm-thermal-paper-roll-copy/,2024-02-20T23:06:21Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9377858638763428,358,2.5863637924194336,3

"A new Chinese SUV called Niutron NV has passed various winter tests. These tests became extremely popular among Chinese automakers. These tests have become a way of getting more publicity. Sometimes Chinese companies even invite the media to test drive the test cars on ice. Aside from the cold-weather test, there is some additional information about NV SUV. The Niutron company has applied for patents for BEV and REEV versions of this vehicle. Now we know how to distinguish between them. Pre-orders for the Niutron NV will start on March 31, 2022.
What is Niutron?
The Niutron is a new premium EV brand. Its founder and one of the key investors is a controversial Chinese billionaire and former CTO of Baidu. His name is Yan Li, and we also know him as the founder of Niu – a legendary Chinese electric scooter maker. Niutron now operates a 770,000-square-meter R&D and manufacturing plant in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, roughly 200km from Shanghai. The production capacity is 180,000-unit-per-year.
Niutron NV Winter Tests
The Niutron said their NV SUV has gone through a hundred hours of different tests in the “north of 48° north latitude”. They haven’t pointed out a concrete place, but we know it is Yakeshi city, Inner Mongolia. Several cars, including HiPhi Z, Roewe RX5, and Avatr 11 were tested there. According to Niutron, the temperature there was below 40 degrees Celsius.
This is funny how Chinese automakers “drop the temperature” in this area. Avatr 11 was tested in minus 30 degrees Celsius, HiPhi Z in minus 35, and Niutron now stands for minus 40. Anyway, Niutron said their SUV passed all the tests successfully.
Niutron also launched a pop-up store on March 10. There they presented a car that passed winter tests.
Niutron NV Patent Images
Niutron has applied for patents for the BEV and REEV (range-extended EV – ICE charge the battery) versions of the NV SUV. These pictures are in line with the Niutron NV official images. Now we can see the difference between the two versions of this vehicle. The significant difference between them is the grill. The range-extender NV has got a small grill between its huge blocky headlights. Of course, the all-electric version hasn’t got a grill. Now we know the NV presented at a media event was a range-extender.
Another difference is the gas tank hatch. The REEV version has it, and the BEV doesn’t. In addition, these two versions got different wheels. The all-electric NV has got rims with aerodynamic elements on them.
It is worth mentioning that Niutron has already presented the range-extender NV at a media event earlier. So we have seen an uncamouflaged car as well.

"Some people are still new to the home decorating idea. It is not an easy idea to make them understand what it is all about. The decoration of the home is a personal thing. It is unlike some other things you can do for someone else. How you would want to make your home look and feel is different from how someone else does it.
The same goes for the idea of duvets and comforters. You will need both if you are looking for excellent home decorating ideas, but what do they do? Duvets cover your bed more than a comforter does, and as I said, it will also affect how you want your bed to be made to show off that new duvet cover or pillow case set you just got. If you are looking for a wide variety of quilts in Singapore, check out Weavve Home.
The main goal of a duvet is to protect the bed from starting. Conversely, a comforter can be used in different ways depending on what it is you are going for. It can be used as a decorative piece or to shift the color of your bedding. In either case, it still acts as a performance of a duvet, and I think that is pretty cool. They don’t just want something different, they want something better, and with duvets and comforters, there are plenty of options to choose from when you’re looking for that perfect setting for your bedroom decor.
You first have to decide what size you want your comforter to be. It is going to depend on how much you are going to use it. If you are going to use it as a decorating piece, then the size of your comforter isn’t significant. However, if you are going to be using it for its intended purpose, which is being a cover for your bed, you have got to get the right one for your bed.
You should get a duvet with about 80% down, and 20% feather fill. That way, your comforter can still be soft and warm without getting overly heavy on your side. It is also important to note that your comforter does not have to be the same size as your bed. For example, you can use one queen-size comforter for a king-sized bed and two queen size comforters on a queen size bed. It all depends on how much space you have in your bedroom for a comfortable sleeping experience.
You want to ensure that when you are buying comforters, you are getting the ones most comfortable for you. The top layers of the duvet should be made from microfiber to keep the down from escaping and warming it up quickly. This is also a great way to ensure your duvet doesn’t lose its shape when you wash it. All in all, duvets and comforters are lovely home decorating ideas that may not look as good as a picture hanging on your wall, but they do feel and, more importantly, warm your bed on cold nights.
In conclusion, you should know enough about the uses of duvets to prepare your home decor ideas. These are perfect for your bedroom and bring you much comfort at night.",<urn:uuid:d6a2e6db-9b6b-4230-b89b-e16c49fde5e3>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://casatomada.org/uses-of-duvets-and-comforters-for-your-home-decor-ideas/,2024-02-20T22:11:43Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9737519025802612,667,1.4245915412902832,1

Bob Casino Detailed Review
Bob Casino is a truly unique casino in the world of online casinos, not because of its characteristics (which we will come back to in this article) but because of its assertive visual identity.
The perfect embodiment of “coolness”, Bob is a debonair character who welcomes you and accompanies you throughout your gaming experience: a welcome touch of freshness and good humor, especially for all players who want to have a good time.
But the others need not worry, because good old Bob knows what they like too: games galore, regular promotions, and numerous events to make them want to play regularly.
Finally, before we get into the details, you should know that the casino accepts CAD as one of the 7 currencies accepted, an additional asset to convince Canadian players.
The Website at Bob Casino
The homepage's visual design is cheeky and lively.
The leading figure on the website is, of course, “Bob” himself, who can be seen everywhere.
In terms of color, the game provider relies on a diverse mix but works with a bright choice of tones throughout.
The large image overlays of the games once again provide a separate complexity in the appearance.
The evaluation of the visuals in the Bob Casino review is of course a very subjective quality indicator.
However, the online provider convinced us at this point.
More decisive is the navigation.
The operation is well thought out from A to Z.
Every click is comprehensible and self-explanatory.
Even inexperienced casino players will find their way around in no time.
The main menu consists of the sections Actions, Prizes, Payments, and Tournaments.
In the upper right corner of the screen, you will find the buttons for login and registration.
The games are clearly arranged in the following categories:
- All Games
- New Games
- Table Games
- Live Casino
Furthermore, on the right side of the screen, there is a possibility to filter the games according to the software manufacturer.
If you already know the name of the game, you can directly access it via the search function.
We also noticed that the game provider is displayed in every pictorial game presentation.

Software Providers & Casino Games at Bob Casino
At Bob Casino, there is a good and rich selection of games from the most diverse areas.
It doesn't matter whether the customer is looking for online slots, card games, table games, scratch cards, lotteries, and co. – almost all areas are covered.
Well-known providers in the industry provide the games.
Among the names are big names like NetEnt, Yggdrasil, Microgaming, Play'n'Go, or even Amatic and Evolution Gaming.
As for the games themselves, the ratio of classics and novelties is also balanced.
Bob Casino even has a. Menu item under which the new games are displayed.
Nevertheless, players do not have to do without classics like Immortal Romance, Book of Dead, or Starburst.
Jackpots also appear in the Bob Casino offer.
Unfortunately, there is no separate category for them.
Jackpot Jester, Jurassic Jackpot, or Jackpot Express are games that are available to customers.
The same goes for Keno, scratch cards, or Bingo from the computerized section.
What we liked very much is that you can filter by providers. Always one of the very useful features.
Games at Bob Casino:
- Baccarat Live Dealer
- Blackjack Live Dealer
- Roulette Live Dealer
- Progressive Slots
- Scratch Cards
- Table Games
- Video Poker
Live Casino at Bob Casino
Compared to other regular online casinos, Bob Casino's selection of live dealer games is absolutely fantastic.
In fact, there are games from several providers including Evolution Gaming, Playtech, and Microgaming.
Expect to find the following games:
- Dragon Tiger
- Interactive games (Dream Catcher, Crazy Time, etc.)
- Dice games (Lightning Dice)
- Casino War (Football Studio)
- Monopoly Live
- Mega Ball
- Game Shows
- Sic Bo
As we mentioned before, table games are mixed with live games.
When an image does not have a dealer – it is probably because it is a table game.
If the image has a dealer, it's because the game is live.
Mobile Casino at Bob Casino
Mobile gaming is not a big problem at Bob Casino.
However, players must do without a native app to download.
This is not necessarily a disadvantage, however, because it saves them from having to load their system with additional software.
Furthermore, updating is also a thing of the past.
A web app through which mobile gaming at Bob Casino works is always up to date.
All players need for a web app is the browser of their smartphone or tablet.
Through it, they simply call up the mobile casino.
The offer is impressive, as a large part of the games is offered that is also available on the desktop site – including a large part of the live games.
Of course, it can happen that one or the other game is not available on mobile.
Namely, if it was not designed for mobile use at all.
Sportsbook at Bob Casino
Like many traditional online casinos out there, Bob Casino does not currently offer sports betting.
That's not a point we can take away from the operator, but since we love sports betting in Canada, we've chosen the sites that offer the best markets in soccer, golf, basketball, UFC, boxing, and of course ice hockey.
Check out these reviews and choose your favorite casino and sports betting site:
eSport at Bob Casino
Obviously, there is no eSport betting at Bob Casino either.
Bonus Offers at Bob Casino
Casino fans know all too well that bonuses and promotions are a crucial part of getting new customers and keeping them entertained.
Bob Casino is well aware of this priority and that is why they have put a lot of attention on their promotions section.
Let's see what exactly is in the following paragraphs!
A bonus of up to C$1,500 on your first 3 deposits is waiting for you when you sign up.
With this bonus, you can enjoy all the best games with the bets you really want to make.
Your first deposit is doubled by the house, up to C$100, plus you get 100 free spins for the first 4 days.
The second and third bonuses offer up to C$250 and C$1,000 respectively, and both are 50% of the amount deposited.
The third deposit allows you to win even more, as the cash amount is supplemented by 30 free spins.
All winnings from deposit bonuses and free spins are subject to a 40x wagering requirement.
To qualify for the deposit bonuses, you will need to use the promotional codes listed in the table below.
In addition, you should know that you are also eligible for bonuses if you make your deposits in bitcoin or other accepted cryptocurrencies.
As far as other bonus offers are concerned, Bob Casino is not exactly broad.
There is a promotional calendar where special surprises are waiting every day.
Additionally, there is a VIP area available for the players.
This VIP area consists of 22 individual levels so that both beginners and high rollers can enjoy special benefits and surprises.
However, various bonus offers, free spins, or even cash can be hidden here.
Loyalty Rewards at Bob Casino
Bob Casino offers its customers the previously mentioned VIP area.
This VIP area is usable for beginners among the customers as well as for absolute high rollers with high stakes.
The variety consists of the fact that there are a whopping 22 VIP levels.
Bonuses, free spins, or cash are available at each VIP level.
To climb up the bonus ladder, players must collect bonus points.
One bonus point is awarded for every 18 dollars wagered.
To reach the 22nd and highest level – which brings C$10,000 cash – customers must earn 300,000 bonus points.
So, this level is more for high rollers.
Payment Methods at Bob Casino
The payment transactions are not rated very well in the Bob Casino review, for one simple reason.
A fee of 2.5 percent is charged for all deposits, regardless of the selected payment method.
This is unusual in the casino provider comparison and leads in the evaluation to significant point deductions.
For smaller deposits, the Paysafecard prepaid codes are very suitable.
Bank transfers can be made in real-time using Interac, Interac e-Transfer, and MuchBetter.
From the section of e-wallets, Canadian customers can only use ecoPayz.
The minimum deposit amount is ten dollars for almost all methods.
A maximum of C$4,000 per transfer can be left at the checkout.
Withdrawals at Bob Casino
On a positive note, the payouts are super-fast.
The internal processing takes less than two hours, provided that the legitimation check has been successfully completed.
Before the first payout, every player must verify his identity by means of a photo ID and a recent address certificate.
All payment methods that have already been used for a deposit are available as withdrawal methods, provided that this is technically possible.
The minimum withdrawal must be C$20, only the bookings in favor of ecoPayz are already possible from ten dollars.
There are clear maximum limits in the following steps:
- 4,000 dollars per day
- 000 dollars per week
- 40,000 dollars per month
Customer Support at Bob Casino
Players who need help can contact the customer support department available through live chat and email.
For many players, live chat is the fastest and most popular option that allows customers to get in touch with a representative within seconds.
It is available 24/7, so you are always covered and assisted.
The Pros of Bob Casino
- Free tours with registration
- Cutting edge games
- Modern theme and interface
- Outstanding VIP program
The Cons of Bob Casino
- Limited game search function before registration
Bob Casino makes an excellent impression in most respects.
For example, we like the bonus that takes not only the first deposit but the first three.
A no deposit bonus is also available.
In total, up to C$500 and 140 free spins await the players.
The game's offer is very strong and offers action from many areas.
Slots, card games, table games, scratch cards, lotteries, and Co. are there.
An extensive live offer also awaits the customers.
The payment methods are good without being spectacular.
Mobile gaming works via web app, security, and seriousness are covered by a valid license from Malta.
The support is okay but cannot convince across the board.
Nevertheless, we give Bob Casino both thumbs up.",<urn:uuid:b45f7d2a-6e50-495d-b5d8-f6548f4bb0c2>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://casinoble.ca/online-casinos/bob-casino/,2024-02-20T21:56:53Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9400668740272522,2801,0.7453329563140869,1

"The Purdue College of Pharmacy, consistently ranked among the 10 best pharmacy programs in the nation, offers a uniquely diverse range of undergraduate and graduate study opportunities. A total of 10 different programs and 700 pharmacy practice experiences prepare students for a range of top-paying careers in the fields of pharmacy, pharmaceutical sciences, and the health sciences.
The Purdue College of Pharmacy offers three undergraduate programs:
- The Pre-Pharmacy Program is a two-year, non-degree program that is intended to prepare students for entry into the PharmD program below. Completing this program, however, does not guarantee entry into the PharmD program.
- The Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences (BSPS) is a four-year undergraduate program that stresses the multidisciplinary basic sciences related to drug discovery, development, and commercialization. A degree in this program does not allow graduates to become licensed pharmacists.
- The Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) is a professional degree program, which requires completion of a recognized pre-pharmacy program. Successful completion of this degree allows you to sit for the licensing exam to practice pharmacy.
The Purdue College of Pharmacy boasts one of the oldest and most-respected graduate programs in the U.S. Each of the three departments of the Purdue College of Pharmacy offer graduate programs:
Each department offers a PhD degree program. All six of these programs require strong undergraduate preparation, including completion of a Bachelors Degree for admission.
A combined-degree program allows students in the third year of the PharmD program to begin work on a Pharmacy PhD program while completing the PharmD curricula. Through a judicious choice of electives and research rotations, such students can save up to two years on the total time required for the PhD program. Additional information can be found by reading the full program description.
For more information, please contact Dr. Tonglei Li, the Associate Dean for Graduate Programs.

"Vatican City, Dec 11, 2022 / 08:35 am (CNA).
Pope Francis said Sunday he is concerned about recent deadly clashes in the northern part of South Sudan.
“I follow with sorrow and concern the news from South Sudan about the violent clashes of the past few days,” he said Dec. 11 at the end his Sunday Angelus message.
Pope Francis is scheduled to travel to South Sudan’s capital city, Juba, in just under eight weeks.
“Let us pray to the Lord for peace and national reconciliation, so that the attacks may cease and that civilians may always be respected,” Francis said Sunday, after violence broke out in South Sudan’s Upper Nile state, in the north-eastern part of the country, last week.
United Nations agencies said over 9,000 people were displaced in the clashes, and an unknown number of people were killed.
Pope Francis’ Feb. 3-5 visit to South Sudan, which he will undertake together with the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the moderator of the Church of Scotland, Iain Greenshields, is to be a “pilgrimage of peace.”
The pope’s journey to South Sudan will follow a three-day visit to the city of Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The motto of the South Sudan trip comes from John 17: “I pray that all may be one.”
The dates of the pope’s travels to the two African countries was announced earlier this month; it was originally to take place in July but was postponed by the Vatican due to problems with Pope Francis’ knee.
The latest outbreak of violence in South Sudan is a continuation of fighting that began in August in a village in Upper Nile, according to Reuters.
In parts of the country, clashes over access to resources such as water and grazing land are common.
A missionary and bishop in South Sudan told journalists in April that the country is still working to implement peace, and that on his trip, Pope Francis will not find “peace realized, but peace persisting.”
The logistics of the pope’s trip will be difficult, but the national security authorities are prepared to handle it, Bishop Christian Carlassare of Rumbek said via video call April 21. “There are no major risks” to Pope Francis’ safety, he added.
He said the country is also facing economic problems, conflicts connected to the control of resources such as oil, and farming issues caused by hard rains and flooding.

"Vancouver is a growing and diverse city with significant housing challenges. Whether it's homelessness, a lack of new rental homes, or high prices for single-family homes, Vancouver residents face housing pressures across the financial spectrum. With the population expected to grow to at least 740,000 by 2041, energy and resource costs increasing, and housing prices among the highest in Canada, there is a growing public demand for bold, creative proposals to create more affordable housing choices in Vancouver.
Providing a range of housing options is critical to the social and economic health of the City, and meeting this challenge is the top priority for Vancouver City Hall. It is no easy task. The City of Vancouver is limited in its taxation and regulatory powers, revenue base, and land constraints. Following re-election in November 2011, Mayor Robertson launched the Mayor's Task Force on Housing Affordability, comprised of local housing stakeholders to provide options on both protecting and creating affordable housing in Vancouver.
This category is geared towards bold, innovative ideas for creating large amounts of affordable housing in Vancouver. Utilizing land within 800m of an existing or proposed rapid transit line, or land and properties owned by a public body such as the City or another level of government--what can we do that we're not doing now? How can we get affordable housing built in a way that meets the needs of Vancouver residents now and in the future, AND create opportunities for food production, active living, energy production, transportation, green space, learning and employment? How can we work with third parties, like philanthropists, not for profits, and financial institutions to finance and build affordable housing in Vancouver? This is an opportunity to explore a site-specific solution that uses new technologies, financing models and materials as well as new mixes of uses and locations. These are big-picture solutions that take care of the basics--meeting the needs of Vancouver residents now and in the future--building bold now, to create a resilient and healthy city for tomorrow. Winners will be selected in two streams within this category, Building Bold: Public Land and Building Bold: Private Land. (Submissions that use a mix of public/private should be entered into the public stream).

"Cartilage is a flexible tissue that exists at the end of your bones at joints and also exists in other parts of your body such as your ears and nose. Cartilage allows the bones at joints to move against each other easily without causing pain.
When you have a cartilage defect, it causes bones at joints to hurt because of the cartilage rub against each other. The most common symptoms people with cartilage defects experience are stiffness, swelling, and inflammation in the joints. Although the actual defect is in the cartilage between the bones, the pain is caused by the bones rubbing against each other without adequate cushioning. The pain will likely radiate to the area surrounding the bones – especially if the condition goes untreated for an extended period of time.
Cartilage defects can happen for a variety of reasons, including injuries or accidents, as well as due to genetic issues.
Injuries or Accidents
The more active your lifestyle, the more likely you are of damaged cartilage. If you play sports or do strenuous exercise, it’s possible to injure cartilage in the process.
One such injury is a cartilage tear. This type of injury involves the cartilage in your joints being torn into multiple pieces rather than functioning as a single unit. The pieces of cartilage may move around within the joint and since there is no cushion between the bones anymore, you will experience pain when the bones move. This can happen as the result of trauma to the area, such as from a sports injury or car accident.
The type of treatment required to fix a cartilage tear depends on the exact injury and its severity. Sometimes, cartilage tears can be fixed without surgery. However, in cases where the damage is significant, surgery will be required.
If you don’t take part in sports or strenuous exercise and haven’t been in an auto accident, it is still possible to develop a cartilage defect. Cartilage defects can develop naturally, either being present at birth or developing over time without any obvious cause. In these cases, the cartilage defect may be due to genetic factors or due to a family history of the same or similar issues.
The younger a person is when they develop a cartilage defect, the more genetics or heredity may be suspected to play a role. For example, if an otherwise healthy woman in her 30s has a cartilage defect, it may indicate genetics because, at her young age, cartilage deterioration should not yet be significant.
Treatment of these types of cartilage defects vary. If the cartilage itself is damaged, then surgery may fix it. However, if there is an unresolved underlying issue causing the defect, the damage may recur. For example, individuals with osteoporosis have a higher chance of cartilage defects or the worsening of cartilage defects over time. For these individuals, treatment needs to also be focused on treating the osteoporosis as well as the cartilage defect.
If you are having severe pain in a joint, it may be caused by a cartilage defect. The best course of action is to visit a specialist to figure out what is causing the pain and begin a treatment plan to control the issue.

"Black Community Struggle, Academia and the Legacies of Enslavement Interview
Interviews, New in Ceasefire - Posted on Monday, April 28, 2014 16:50 - 0 Comments
In 2013, Joy Degruy, Assistant Professor at Portland State University (USA), was brought in to one of the centres of Britain’s black community – Tottenham, North London. The visit was organised by Stafford Scott, co-ordinater of Tottenham Rights and Race Advocacy a Officer at The Monitoring Group, and Robbie Shilliam, lecturer in the Department of International Relations at Queen Mary’s, University of London.
Degruy has become well-known across the US for her contribution to both black intellectual thought and her educative work with black communities. Her book, Post-Traumatic Slave Syndrome, seeks to unpack the collective trauma experienced by black communities in the a West following enslavement and colonisation.
Disproportionate levels of intracommunal violence, hierarchies of knowledge which champion European thought and anti-African beauty industries are explained through an understanding of how low collective self-worth is instigated by enslavement but compounded and reproduced over generations by racist oppression.
The uniqueness of both the transatlantic slave trade, and the position of Africans in Europe’s settler colonies in the US and Caribbean for the generations which followed enslavement, has created a very specific experience of racism, with deep-seated psychological effects.
Degruy’s rigorous, yet frank approach to deconstructing how racism is internalised, particularly by the descendants of enslaved Africans, seeks to help black communities rebuild their relationships with each other, and themselves, in an environment that continues to display hostility towards black progress, reproducing the structures of a society entrenched in white domination.
Given the urgency of such work, it is remarkable that few British-based academics, if any, are in a position to play a similar role in black communities this side of the Atlantic. Robbie Shilliam and Stafford Scott discuss not only the work of Joy Degruy, but the issue of black academia in the UK. What role do black intellectuals play in black community struggles in Britain today? Is their impact being felt, and how can they feed into each other?
Given the myriad of issues currently facing black communities, such as the growing prison industrial complex, the failures by the education system, mental health and under/unemployment, there can be no doubt that both activism and academia have significant roles to play in building collective resistance.
With Britain’s anti-racist movement still recovering from the destruction caused by Thatcherism, and academia becoming increasingly privatised, a conversation on how the strengths of these two approaches can be best utilised, is as pertinent as ever.",<urn:uuid:6b0cf36b-0e64-4e25-8565-3de21fde778a>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/black-community-struggle-academia-legacies-enslavement-discussion/,2024-02-20T22:06:10Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9394218921661377,569,2.0250144004821777,2

"Dentons has advised the CPI Property Group on its EUR 635 million three-year bridge loan from Santander, Societe Generale, Komercni Banka, Raiffeisen, SMBC, Barclays, and Erste Bank to replace the group's existing loans related to its recent acquisitions of Immofinanz and S Immo. Linklaters reportedly advised the banks.
The CPI Property Group is an owner of income-generating European real estate. It focuses on the Czech Republic, Berlin, Warsaw, and the CEE region and has approximately EUR 21 billion in assets.
""The loan is strategic for the group as it proactively extends maturities of the two acquisition loans to further support our ratings,"" CPIPG General Counsel Martin Matula commented.
Dentons also advised CPI on the initial financing deals for the two acquisitions: the EUR 2.5 billion bridge loan facility to finance its takeover of Immofinanz AG (as reported by CEE Legal Matters on December 20, 2021) and the EUR 1.25 billion bridge loan facility to finance the takeover of S Immo (as reported by CEE Legal Matters on May 2, 2022).

"Data availability sampling
Data availability sampling is a mechanism for light nodes to verify data availability without having to download all data for a block. Data availability sampling (DAS) works by having light nodes conduct multiple rounds of random sampling for small portions of block data. As a light node completes more rounds of sampling for block data, it increases its confidence that data is available. Once the light node successfully reaches a predetermined confidence level (e.g. 99%) it will consider the block data as available.
When implemented in blockchain designs like Celestia, data availability sampling enables light nodes to contribute to both the security and throughput of the network with significantly cheaper hardware than that of full nodes.",<urn:uuid:de2158df-f309-4bb3-8b2a-312613c5a623>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://celestia.org/glossary/data-availability-sampling/?ref=infura.ghost.io,2024-02-20T23:28:53Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.8748767375946045,137,2.143709421157837,2

"FREEHOLD TOWNSHIP – Two new Class III special law enforcement officers have been hired by the Township Committee to provide protection to students and staff members in Freehold Township’s schools.
During a recent meeting, committee members appointed Joseph Lynch and William Rodriguez as Class III officers on the recommendation of Police Chief Ernest Schriefer. The appointments run through Dec. 31.
According to a resolution, the Class III officers are authorized to exercise full powers and duties similar to those of full-time police officers while providing security at Freehold Township schools during the hours the schools are normally in session or when they are occupied by students or teachers.
While on duty in their jurisdiction, a Class III officer may respond to offenses or emergencies off school grounds if they occur in the officer’s presence while traveling to a school, but an officer may not otherwise be dispatched or dedicated to any assignment off a school property owned by the township.
Freehold Township has nine public schools: the Early Childhood Learning Center, C. Richard Applegate Elementary School, Joseph J. Catena Elementary School, Laura Donovan Elementary School, Marshall W. Errickson Elementary School, West Freehold Elementary School, Clifton T. Barkalow Middle School, and Dwight D. Eisenhower Middle School, which comprise the Freehold Township K-8 School District, and Freehold Township High School, which is part of the Freehold Regional High School District.
In other business, committee members awarded a $158,694 contract to Hunter Jersey Peterbilt, Millstone Township, for the furnishing and delivery of one new single-axle dump truck. Hunter Jersey Peterbilt submitted the only bid of $190,694 for the contract and the purchase was reduced by a $32,000 trade-in, according to the resolution.
Committee members also passed a resolution extending a contract that was awarded to Automated Building Controls Inc. in 2017 for heating, ventilation and air conditioning maintenance in the township for another year. The estimated amount of the contract extension, according to the resolution, is $72,000.
Additionally, committee members authorized the award of four contracts for the emergency repair and cleanup of the Freehold Township Senior Center, Jackson Mills Road, as the result of flooding from a burst water line pipe in the utility closet, which flooded the entire building.
According to the resolution, $25,944 was awarded to Albitron LLC; $11,381 was awarded to Service Master of the Shore Area; $8,525 was awarded to Automated Building Controls Inc.; and $410 was awarded to A-General Plumbing & Sewer Service Inc.; for a total cost of $46,260.",<urn:uuid:51728df3-445e-434e-9dbc-8bd1ef17a837>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://centraljersey.com/2019/05/21/freehold-township-hires-additional-class-iii-officers-for-schools/,2024-02-20T23:50:45Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9720541834831238,549,1.2451772689819336,1

"Chloe Townsend has managed to make the creative shift from designer to artist look not only seamless, but joyful. Missibaba, Townsend’s slow-leather-crafted goods brand, holds the same striking boldness of her works on canvas and paper. With an enduring fascination with the natural world, Townsend’s work speaks to the intricacies of ecosystems, the complex and sometimes frighteningly primitive ways that come with all things living and seeking to survive. The artist’s background in leatherwork lends a three-dimensional, pastiche-like quality to her works. Vibrant colour, cut-outs, layers of gouache and the sumptuous play of patterns and lines make each piece a visceral feast.

"Back in 2013, 57-year-old Barbara thought she was fairly healthy. She had some back pains, but she put them down to age. When the pains persisted, however, she sought a diagnosis – the start of a life-saving journey with Leon Adams and the Hepatology team at Charlies.
A new catheter, developed by researchers from Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and UWA, is helping patients in the final stages of lung cancer, breast cancer and mesothelioma breathe more easily and spend precious time at home, rather than in hospital. It’s an innovation that has made a huge difference to Tom Sutcliffe’s life.
At the age of 14, Brieanna, suddenly feeling unwell, went to her GP who thought she might have glandular fever. Later that night, she was so sick that she was rushed in an ambulance to hospital, where she was diagnosed with end stage kidney failure.

"An oil well drilling rig is not an abstract idea. A method of operating an oil well drilling rig is also not an abstract idea. This proposition should be clear to all, but in TDE Petroleum Data Solutions v AKM Enterprise, the Federal Circuit held that a method of operating an oil well drilling rig is directed to the abstract idea of “storing data, receiving data, and using mathematics or a computer to organize that data and generate additional information.”
Section 101 of the Patent Act has been interpreted to prohibit the patenting of abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenomena. Although recent Supreme Court cases have universally found the patents at issue ineligible, Bilski, Alice and Mayo cite approvingly to a previous Supreme Court case, Diamond v. Diehr, which found a process for molding rubber articles with the aid of a computer to be patent eligible.
Alice and Mayo established a now-famous two-part test to determine whether a patent claims ineligible subject matter. The first step of the Alice/Mayo test asks whether the claim is “directed to” one of the prohibited categories. The second step asks whether the claim involves an “inventive concept” sufficient to confer patent eligibility. The Federal Circuit has applied this test with ruthless efficiency to invalidate patents, although sanity is slowly returning as the court has upheld patents improving computer animation of faces and the preservation of liver cells.
Unfortunately, the Federal Circuit rarely compares the facts of the cases before it to controlling Supreme Court precedent. The clear similarity between the claims to operating an oil well drilling rig in TDE and the claims to curing rubber in Diehr show how far off course the Federal Circuit has veered in interpreting section 101.
In Diehr, the claimed method used a computer to precisely control a rubber molding process. The computer allowed the inventors to measure and recalculate the time to cure the rubber while it was in the mold. At the end of the method, a rubber article was produced. In TDE, the claimed method used a computer to control the drilling of an oil well. The computer permitted the inventors to accurately determine the state of the well operation. Different claims provided for different ends of the method, including adjusting the operation of the drill (claim 30) and selecting the state of the well operation (claim 1).
A side-by-side analysis of representative claims from TDE and Diehr at the bottom of this post shows exactly how similar they are. Each claim recites (1) an industrial process that uses (2) initial data combined with (3) newly collected data that is (4) analyzed to (5) improve the output or operation of the industrial process.
It is worth repeating: in both Diehr and TDE, the claims were directed to an industrial process. The general industrial processes existed previously in the art. Molding rubber using the defined equation was well known. Drilling an oil well with consideration of the state of the well operation was known. The contributions in both Diehr and TDE were the addition of data collection and analysis to improve the operation of the industrial process. Neither portion of the Federal Circuit’s analysis in TDE cites to Diehr, let alone analyzes the obvious similarities between the claims at issue and those found patent eligible by the Supreme Court.
In a single paragraph of analysis regarding step one of the Mayo/Alice test, the Federal Circuit held that claim 1 of the TDE patent was directed to the abstract idea of “storing data, receiving data, and using mathematics or a computer to organize that data and generate additional information.” It completely ignored parts of the claim that required the data to be collected from an oil well drilling operation and to be used for the oil well drilling operation. Of course, ignoring these parts of the claim was required to find that the claim was directed to an abstract idea of data manipulation.
Also taking only a single paragraph, the Federal Circuit’s analysis of Mayo/Alice step two was similarly devoid of engagement with the explicit claim requirements of an oil well drilling operation. Instead, it focused only on what the computer was doing in the process, rather than the process as a whole. Diehr, along with many other cases, explicitly requires that the process be considered as a whole in the section 101 analysis.
The Federal Circuit’s error here is worse than it was in Ariosa v. Sequenom. In Ariosa, the court engaged with the closest factual Supreme Court precedent, although it felt bound by Mayo to find the claims ineligible. However, the court in TDE completely ignored and disregarded Diehr, the Supreme Court case that aligns in both law and fact with the claims at issue. Had the court analyzed or considered Diehr, it is likely the outcome would have been different.
To the extent that one asserts the final method of utilizing the data distinguished claim 1 in Diehr from claim 1 in TDE, dependent claim 30 of the patent at issue in TDE cured this defect. Claim 30 recites: “[t]he method of claim 1, further comprising using the state of the well operation to evaluate parameters and provide control for the well operation.” (emphasis added). Thus, the patent in TDE explicitly claimed the actual operation of the industrial machinery, just as the claim in Diehr.
The Federal Circuit stated that it was not considering separately the remaining claims of the patent, ostensibly because TDE did not “distinguish those claims from representative claim 1.” On the contrary, TDE argued claim 30 and related claims separately on precisely the ground that claim 30 “closed [the] loop” and required control of the well.
At this point, it is clear that neither the Federal Circuit nor the Supreme Court are going to step in to fix the wayward path of patent eligibility law. It will therefore be up to Congress to affirm what should be apparent to all: an oil rig is not an abstract idea.
Diehr – Claim 1* (US Application No. 05/602,463) | TDE – Claim 1 (US Patent No. 6,892,812) | Analysis | |
1 – Preamble | A method of operating a rubber-molding press for precision molded compounds with the aid of a digital computer, comprising: | An automated method for determining the state of a well operation, comprising: | Both claims are directed to industrial processes where the underlying process (rubber molding or oil well drilling) existed prior to the invention |
2 – Initial Data | providing said computer with a database for said press, including at least,
natural logarithm conversion data (ln), the activation energy constant (C) unique to each batch of said compound being molded, and a constant (x) dependent upon the geometry of the particular mold of the press, |
storing a plurality of states for a well operation; | Both claims require data to be provided prior to operation of the method to interpret data collected. |
3 – New Data Collection | initiating an interval timer in said computer upon the closure of the press for monitoring the elapsed time of said closure,
constantly determining the temperature (Z) of the mold at a location closely adjacent to the mold cavity in the press during molding, constantly providing the computer with the temperature (Z), |
receiving mechanical and hydraulic data reported for the well operation from a plurality of systems; | Both claims require collecting data from sources that are specific to the machinery being operated. Therefore, both claims require specific machinery, not just a general purpose computer. |
4 – Data Analysis | repetitively calculating in the computer, at frequent intervals during each cure, the Arrhenius equation for reaction time during the cure, which is
ln v = CZ + x where v is the total required cure time, repetitively comparing in the computer at said frequent intervals during the cure each said calculation of the total required cure time calculated with the Arrhenius equation and said elapsed time, and |
and determining that at least some of the data is valid by comparing the at least some of the data to at least one limit, the at least one limit indicative of a threshold at which the at least some of the data do not accurately represent the mechanical or hydraulic condition purportedly represented by the at least some of the data; and when the at least some of the data are valid, based on the mechanical and hydraulic data, | Both claims analyze the data.
Although not apparent on the face of the claims, the underlying data analysis existed in the art for both claims. The Arrhenius equation was well known. Validating well drilling data against a limit was known in the art although its usefulness was disputed. |
5 – Utilizing the Data | opening the press automatically when a said comparison indicates equivalence. | automatically selecting one of the states as the state of the well operation. | Both claims use the data generated in the industrial process. Selecting an individual state of a well operation in a necessary component of operating the well. |
*Claim 1 is representative for both the application in Diehr and the patent in TDE.",<urn:uuid:e636aaed-42ca-43d7-9e2b-e5e910f3ec0b>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://cip2.gmu.edu/2016/10/27/federal-circuit-improperly-extends-abstract-idea-exception-to-industrial-machines/,2024-02-20T21:41:50Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9448926448822021,1882,2.1377902030944824,2

"Bam Margera, the former “Jackass” star, has reached a significant milestone in his journey to recovery. After a month of sobriety, Margera is not only taking control of his life again but also hitting the skate park with renewed vigor.
Bam Margera, former “Jackass” star, has reached the milestone of one month of sobriety and is pursuing his passion for skateboarding again. With newfound support and a personal determination to stay sober, Margera is embracing a healthier lifestyle.
A Month of Sober Living
Sources close to Margera have revealed that he recently marked one month of sobriety while staying on a farm outside of Philadelphia, owned by another professional skateboarder. During this time, Margera, along with his girlfriend Dannii, has been focused on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. They have been hitting the gym daily, going on invigorating hikes with their dogs, and as a result, Margera has shed a considerable amount of weight.
Back to Skateboarding
With his improved physical condition, Margera has been able to return to skateboarding. Described as making it look effortless, he is embracing his love for the sport once again. However, what sets Margera’s current journey apart is his commitment to surrounding himself with a supportive and positive circle of friends. A decisive moment came when Dannii presented him with an ultimatum, and Margera chose her over alcohol.
A Personal Choice
Unlike previous attempts at sobriety, Margera now feels motivated to stay sober for himself. This is a significant shift, as it is not influenced by external factors such as family or friends staging an intervention. Margera’s current journey represents a personal desire to make lasting changes and live a healthier life.
In other news, Margera has been grappling with a legal battle over custody of his five-year-old son, Phoenix, with his estranged wife Nikki. Temporary sole custody was granted to Nikki last month following Margera’s arrest and citation for public intoxication on separate occasions. Despite the ongoing custody dispute, Margera has been able to maintain regular contact with his son through FaceTime.
Lastly, Margera’s brother, Jess, shared earlier this year that Margera had destroyed a guitar gifted to them by legendary musician Billy Idol in a fit of rage. In a surprising turn of events, Margera and Dannii recently spent time with Idol in Philadelphia after one of his concerts, where Idol graciously signed a new guitar for Margera.
As Margera’s journey continues, his accomplishments in sobriety and skateboarding signify a renewed determination to embrace a healthier and more fulfilling life.",<urn:uuid:aa21b5de-6a9c-4741-a12b-ed7a0c19e0f7>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://citizenside.com/news/bam-margera-achieves-30-days-of-sobriety-and-returns-to-skateboarding/,2024-02-20T23:47:37Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9760351777076721,560,1.134176254272461,1

"Home is more than just a physical space; it is the sanctuary where our stories unfold, and our lives find their rhythm. It is a place where comfort intertwines with memories, creating a unique tapestry of warmth and belonging. In this exploration of the essence of Home, we delve into the multifaceted dimensions that transform a mere structure into a haven of love, growth, and self-discovery.
The Physical Shelter
At its core, a home is a shelter—a place that shields us from the elements and provides a secure haven. Whether it’s a modest apartment, a suburban house, or a rural cottage, the physical space we call home is the canvas upon which we paint the story of our lives. The walls, the floors, and the roof serve as the silent witnesses to our joys, sorrows, and everything in between.
Beyond the bricks and mortar, the arrangement of furniture, the choice of colors, and the play of natural light contribute to the unique character of each home. These elements influence not only the aesthetics but also the emotional atmosphere within the walls. A well-designed home can be a source of inspiration, promoting productivity and creativity.
The Emotional Hearth
Home is a vessel for emotions, a crucible where relationships are forged and nurtured. It is where we share laughter around the dinner table, seek solace in the embrace of loved ones, and weather storms as a united front. The emotional hearth of a home is stoked by the bonds between family members, friends, and even pets.",<urn:uuid:0999f98b-7de9-4484-bdc6-89b11e5b5ec0>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://clarice-note.com/the-heart-of-harmony-exploring-the-essence-of-home/,2024-02-20T23:09:04Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9364252090454102,316,2.2209978103637695,2

"Well, I didn’t think this would be the first challenge I signed up for in 2020, but I was anticipating its announcement. Keely at A Common Reader is hosting a Russian Literature Challenge for 2020. Yay! I signed up for her Ancient Greek Challenge in 2016 and it was a great success. I can’t wait for the chance to read some more Russian Literature to add to that which I’ve already read.
Keely at We Went Outside and Saw The Stars is hosting a Russian Literature Challenge for 2017 about which I’m very excited! In the past couple of years, I’ve continued reading Tolstoy, have begun to delve into Dostoyevsky, have explored some of Chekhov’s works, and have aspirations to read more Pushkin. What better way to accomplish my plans than the Russian Literature Challenge?
Here are the levels to aim for:
- Level One (Tolstoy): 1-3 books
- Level Two (Chekov): 4-6 books
- Level Three (Dostoevsky): 7-11 books
- Level Four (Turgenev): 12+ books
You can count short stories, poetry, novels, novellas and plays in your book count.
As for my planned reads? Ugh, I don’t really like plans because for me they always change, but I’ll list a few possibilities I might chose:
- Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky and a short story or two (my annoyance with D is turning into fascination)
- The Kreutzer Sonata by Leo Tolstoy & a short story or two
- Anna Akhmatova (poetry)
- The Diary of A Superfluous Man by Ivan Turgenev
- The Queen of Spades by Alexander Pushkin and others
- A Hero of Our Time by Mikhail Lermontov
- Dead Souls by Nikolia Gogol
- Oblomov by Ivan Goncharov
- Chekhov’s works
- Dr. Zhivago by Boris Pasternak
- Heart of A Dog by Mikhail Bulgakov
- something by Vladimir Nabokov
- One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch by Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn
- The Gulag Archipelago by Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn
- We by Yevgeny Zamyatin
Before I start, I’d also love to read Lectures on Russian Literature by Vladimir Nabokov.
I’m having many wishful thoughts, I know. For someone who was complaining about not having enough challenges for 2017, my slate seems to be filling up rapidly. I just hope I can keep up!
“Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes …..”
I am very hesitant to even attempt to review this book. How can one do even the slightest bit of justice to an epic like this? How can one even touch on the depth of the myriad of characters, not to mention communicate the complexities of a war that even the participants had difficulty distinguishing? And how do you review such an epic tale without producing an epic review?
War and Peace follows the lives of five families of Tsarist Russia: the Rostovs, the Bolkonskis, the Bezukhovs, the Kuragins and the Drubetskoys, their interactions and struggles, and the afflictions suffered by each set among the events leading up to and during Napoleon’s invasive campaign in the year of 1812. Pierre Bezukhov is the illegitimate son of a nobleman and, through a series of circumstances, inherits a great fortune. His new position in society chafes against his natural character of simplicity, naiveté, and introspection. The Rostov family is a well-respected family, yet are in financial difficulties. The son, Nikolai, joins the Russian army, his brother, Petya, will soon follow, and their daughter, Natasha, a joyful free-spirit, becomes attached to a number of men throughout the story. Sophia, an orphaned niece, is raised by the Rostovs, and shows a steady and loyal character as she pledges her love to Nikolai early in the novel. Bolkonsky senior is a crochety old count who attempts to control his son, Andrei, and terrorizes his daughter, Maria.

And so begins the dance between the cast of characters, sometimes a smooth waltz, and at others a frenzied tango. There is contrast between generations, between old and new ideas, between life and its purpose, yet Tolstoy is adept as showing the gray tones overshadowing the blacks and whites; that situations are not always as they appear.
Tolstoy’s highest attribute is his ability to peel off the layers of each person and look into his soul. His characters are crafted with such depth and such human motivations that the reader can only marvel at his skill. And not only can he give birth to such characters, he understands them. The scenes involving the Russian peasantry, who act completely contrary to reason, yet with such humanness, are evidence of Tolstoys profound comprehension of human nature and the human condition.
Count Leo Tolstoy, 1908 from Wikipedia |
I love how Tolstoy lets humanity and compassion show through the animosity and the bloodletting of war. One of my favourite characters of the novel was Ramballe, the French officer whom Pierre met in Bazdeev’s house and who showed brotherhood and goodwill despite that fact that, given the circumstances, they should have been pitted against each other as sworn enemies. Originally, Pierre is portrayed somewhat as a bumbling oaf, a man of a lower class who, by luck and circumstances has managed to rise to a position of prestige yet has never been able to cast aside his peasant-like origins. However by his actions in the novel, he becomes admirable, echoing a segment of humanity that shows kindness, goodness, bravery and integrity that shines out from the avariciousness and shallowness of high society.
Tolstoy himself was very ambiguous about his masterpiece stating that it was, “not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less an historical chronicle.” He believed that if the work was masterful, it could not conform to accepted standards and therefore could not be labelled.
The Battle of Borodino by Louise-Françoise, Baron Lejeune, 1822
“It is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that when half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to distant provinces, and one levy after another was being raised for the desense of the fatherland, all Russians from the greatest to the least were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves, saving their fatherland, or weeping over its downfall. The tales and descriptions speak only of the self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion, despair, grief, and the heroism of the Russians. But it was not really so. It appears so to us because we see only the general historic interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests that people had. Yet in reality those personal interest of the moment so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt or even noticed. Most of the people at that time paid not attention to the general progress of events but were guided by their own private interests, and they were the very people whose activities at that period were most useful. Those who tried to understand the general course of events and to take part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members of society, they saw everything upside-down, and all they did for the common good turned out to be useless and foolish …….. Even those, fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings, who discussed Russia’s position at the time involuntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of pre tense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty of. ……… Only unconscious action bears fruit, and he who plays a part in an historic event never understands its significance. If he tries to realize it his efforts are fruitless. The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in Russia the less did he realize their significance ……….”
Napoleon’s Retreat from Moscow Adolf Northern source Wikipedia |
Perhaps Tolstoy is showing us that people are imperfect, with human vice and human foibles and that, in spite of trying to find heroics in war, the actions are only the actions of people trying to survive. It is history looking backwards that make the heroes, but in reality, the characters in these trials of life are all people acting out their parts in a very human way. There is no glory in war, only people trying to deal with the circumstances as best they can, and to get by with a little human dignity. Success can be more a matter of chance than planning, and it is often luck or misfortune that places people in either the bright spotlight of fame, or the dark dungeons of villainy.
I know that many people shy away from War and Peace because of its length, and I did too for a long time. Another criticism is that Tolstoy’s “war” parts are monotonous. It certainly is a lengthy novel but by doing some cursive research on this period of Russian history, the reader can gain enough of a base to allow him to relax and be pulled into the story. And by viewing the wars scenes, not only as history, but as a chance to learn from people’s reactions in situations of stress and conflict, I think they can give us more of an insight into human motivations. So pick it up and let yourself be swept away into the Russia Empire of the early 1800s. You won’t be disappointed!

Another challenge check-in and another challenge going along well. My, it’s nice to get these check-ins on near completed challenges instead of the ones I’m struggling through. My challenge goal was to read three Russian novels and so far I have read three, so my challenge, theoretically is complete.
Both Eugene Onegin and Doctor Zhivago were re-reads. I think I’m becoming a re-read advocate because each book that I’ve re-read has given me such a deeper understanding of the work, which, of course, increases my appreciation of it. This quote pretty much sums up my experience:
“In truly good writing no matter how many times you read it you do not know how it is done. That is beacause there is a mystery in all great writing and that mystery does not dis-sect out. It continues and it is always valid. Each time you re-read you see or learn something new.” ~ Ernest Hemingway
Palace Square in winter source Wikipedia |
But, of course, I’m not done; I’m going to continue with the challenge. At least before the end of the year I have Fathers and Sons by Ivan Turgenev planned and in the summer I want to read Russian Thinkers by Isaiah Berlin. The latter would count as a book for this challenge too ……. wouldn’t it ……????
Does anyone have any other suggestions of Russian books that I simply must read? Any suggestions are welcome!
I was so happy to get the chance to participate in Marian at Tanglewood’s Read-Along for my second read of Eugene Onegin in six months. My first time I read the translation by Charles Johnston and this time chose to read James A. Falen’s translation. But more comparisons on the two later.
It was such a joy to read such a lively and often tongue-in-cheek poem, yet Pushkin weaves his jaunty remarks throughout a tale of serious love, serious death and serious coming-of-age, crafting a remarkable masterpiece.
Since I already reviewed Eugene Onegin the first time I read it, I will simply cover a couple of areas that stood out for me from a second read, that were not initially apparent.
First Edition of the novel (source Wikipedia) |
Comparing the two translations, I must say I enjoyed Falen more than Johnston. Johnston’s words have a loftier tone and are perhaps more beautiful, but I think Falen captures the spirit of the poem more accurately. A couple of times, his choice of words appeared awkward, yet he communicated the grave situations in balance with the bouncy, cheekiness of the narrator, with flair and apparent ease. I would recommend him for a first-time reader.
This second read I noticed numerous instances of juxtaposition ………. Tatyana reading books that lead her to form a romantic infatuation with a man she’s barely spoken to vs. Tatyana reading books that lead her to a more mature and formed view of Onegin’s character; Tatyana’s love of the country and woods vs. her marital residence being in the city; Tatyana’s letter vs. Onegin’s letter; Onegin’s rejection of Tatyana, and then Tatyana’s rejection of Onegin; Onegin’s volatile response to a friend’s challenge that leads to that friend’s death vs. Onegin’s wish to seduce a friend’s wife which could have led to a similar circumstance. It really became apparent to me this time that Onegin hadn’t learned anything. It was clear to Tatyana, too. She asks him pointedly, why he is suddenly pursuing her, and her harsh words demonstrate her mistrust of his motives:
” Why mark me out for your attention?
Is it perhaps my new ascension
To circles that you find more swank;
Or that I now have wealth and rank;
Or that my husband, maimed in battle,
Is held in high esteem at Court?
Or would my fall perhaps be sport,
A cause for all the monde to tattle —
Which might in turn bring you some claim
To social scandal’s kind of fame?”
Until he saw Tatyana the second time, he was the same foppish young man, sinking in ennui. She revived him briefly, yet even in the ardent fog of love, his actions are not the actions of a man who has gone through a self-examination from the tragedy that had come from his initial conduct (the duel). If he had managed to convince Tatyana to begin a relationship with him, it would have ended in another duel and another possible death of a friend. I think Tatyana was wise enough to ascertain the baseness of his behaviour and foresaw the consequences. She loved him as a man, yet rejected his ignoble character.

This quote by Onegin sums up his character throughout the poem:
“Yet I in futile dullness squander
These days allotted me by fate …..”
There is a pathos in his words and actions with which the reader can sympathize, hoping for a reversal in his chosen path, but at the end he is still walking the road of self-gratification and boredom, and we can only watch him disappear into the thickening mist …..
Everyone is probably wondering why on earth would I join another challenge? I was wondering the same thing, but his one is too good to pass up. I have been making my way through the Russian literary greats but much too slowly, and this challenge will help me focus and give me connection with friends who are doing the same thing as I. What better reason to join?
The requirements are as follows:
Because this is a classics blog, I would limit it to classic literature. It can be a novel by a Russian author or a novel set in Russia, and how you choose to define “classic” is up to you. And, of course, you can use books from any other challenge you’ve set yourself. Finally, you can list list your books before you start, or, like me, you can just explore and read whatever comes your way.
There are four levels:
- Level one: 1 – 3 books
- Level two: 4 – 6 books
- Level three: 7 – 12 books
- Level four: 12 + books
I am going to go completely against my nature and be conservative, aiming for Level One.
2. The Idiot – Fyodor Dostoyevsky
3. Doctor Zhivago – Boris Pasternak
5. Fathers and Sons – Ivan Turgenev
The Eugene Onegin Read-Along will soon give me my first Russian book for the year.
Best of luck with the challenge, everyone! And thanks to O for creating it!",<urn:uuid:87200ee5-1fca-4489-a2d6-4ddf2f1e8799>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://classicalcarousel.com/category/russian-literature-challenge/,2024-02-20T21:15:38Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9725480675697327,3604,1.1772804260253906,1
"The neatness of your carpet speaks volumes about you specifically and your home in general. While it is a convention to sweep your carpet, busy people or business organizations tend to hire a professional organization to use equipment and machines for a perfect carpet cleaning. Nevertheless, many seek out professionals when it comes to carpet cleaning for special occasions such as festive periods, holding a party, hosting visitors, and above all, maintain perfect hygiene. Apart from that, a carpet cleaner will do a better job in using equipment such as machines, vanish, and steam to clean your carpet and make it practically new again. When searching for a professional carpet cleaner, Clean2Shine has been prominent in offering services that have gotten lots of positive reviews from clients and customers.
Carpet cleaning is a very technical job because if care is not taken, a cleaner may end up damaging the carpet. And the best way to go about it from Clean2Shine perspective is to use the best techniques that work based on the carpet’s outlook. The state of your carpet determines a lot in your home; for example, if your carpet is filled with dirt, wasted food and stains, ants and other harmful substances begin to set in. They can go as far as causing damage to your furniture, clothes and books, and above all, it negates the carefully crafted ambience of your home. You might want to ask yourself, “What do I do?” There are two choices before you: Buy or Rent a Carpet Cleaner? Let’s discuss!
Buy or Rent a Carpet Cleaner
If you decide to clean the carpet yourself, two options lie before you; you can choose to buy a machine or rent one. Purchasing a carpet cleaning machine comes with the advantage of cost-effectiveness because you won’t have to pay carpet cleaners anymore and you can have a perfect carpet cleaning whenever you decide to clean at your convenience.
However, the disadvantage of having your carpet cleaning machine is the cost of maintenance, and mainly, the cleaning device you buy as a single owner is different from the carpet cleaning organization in terms of efficiency and durability. Although, you do not need a commercial-grade carpet cleaning machine, but if it is essential, you can decide to clean more manually if you are the type that appreciates a clean environment every time, but do not appreciate the stress.
The option is to rent from a reputable company like Clean2Shine that makes use of high-quality carpet cleaning machines to clean a carpet in a professional way that brings back the feeling of buying your carpet for the first time. As much as renting the machine is advisable, you may not be able to handle the machine to get that perfect cleaning you are looking for. So, it is advisable to hire the service of Clean2Shine to make your home look habitable again. Hiring a professional cleaner is the preferred option among several people.
Effective Carpet Cleaning Methods
Before cleaning your carpet, it is essential to know the method you want to use. The method you are using to clean will help you understand how to go about the cleaning and will serve as a guide in order not to cause any damage when cleaning. Here are some popular methods you can use to get perfect cleaning:
Hot Water Extraction Method
Dry Carpet Cleaning Method
This method is an upgrade on the hot water method as it helps to avoid any form of water damage to your carpet. It involves the use of detergents on your carpet, the part which soil particles are clinging to. The dry cleaning method ensures that your carpet is entirely vacuumed, which leaves it perfectly clean and scenting nicely.
This method is also referred to as a buffer, and it is a specially made buffing machine along with spray chemicals for a perfect carpet cleaning. Bonnet cleaning requires a special cleaning agent during cleaning. However, only professionals like Clean2Shine can handle it because people who hold this bonnet cleaning are specially trained.
It is essential to state that a method of cleaning a carpet is different from how to clean a carpet. Methods are ways in which one can go about cleaning a carpet, while how to clean is the practical aspect. In other words, “methods” is the theoretical while “how” is practical.
Foam Cleaning Methods
Although this method has not caught on, especially among business organizations, it is common in households as it appears to be a quick way for cleaning carpets. The process of foam cleaning involves two ways of using a cleaning detergent: either spreading a cleaning detergent on the carpet evenly or mixing the detergent into a bucket of water until it is soapy.
If you are spreading a cleaning detergent, the foam is usually attached to a particular machine brush and is carefully placed into the carpet fibres. Through this, the foam is allowed to stay on the carpet for a short period, and dirt is removed faster due to the effect of the vacuum cleaner it is attached to. This method is usually effective because the dry foam is made of 10% liquid and 90% air, so there is low moisture which means there won’t be a residue of heat on the carpet after all is done.
This method is a manual process. The foam is dipped gradually into the bucket where cleaning detergent and water is mixed, brought out and squeezed, then pressed intensely on the carpet to bring out dirt, and then squeezed into another bucket of water. However, this is also an old method that is only common with people who are unable to afford professional cleaning services. The problem is that it doesn’t clean a carpet well as it may leave behind some dirt if the foam is not squeezed well.
How to do Carpet Cleaning in Your Home
These simple processes can help you wash your carpet and get the desired result you are hoping for after cleaning:
- Test your Carpet for Colorfastness
Carpets are sometimes like a cloth whereby, after washing they lose colour quality, mostly if you use detergents and not bar soap. The same goes for carpet cleaning. Before you start, do a colourfastness test to check the durability of colour on your carpet. Endeavour to test the carpet on some parts. Through this, you will determine the level of detergents that will be used to clean it. Do not skip this part for any reason unless you want to have a faded carpet after washing.
- Move Aside Your Furniture and other things
After you are done with the colour testing and your carpet can withstand what cleaning detergent you are using, the next thing is to move the furniture in your room to a safer place. Protect all other things such as television, flower vase, and most importantly, cover the sockets that connect electricity to your electrical products to avoid electrocution. The main thing is to prevent your furniture from contacting excess water because it may damage them.
- Clean the Unaffected Areas First
To make things easier, you should clean the areas that are not stained with dirt, and after then, you can focus on the areas that are affected. The reason why you should do this first is that areas that are not affected won’t give much stress; neither do you need to apply much detergent or water.
- Put in Extra Effort for Efficient Cleaning on Affected Areas
Areas where furniture is sitting on, hallways, dining areas, sitting room carpets are always liable to get more dirt because people often make use of this space. Therefore, it is advisable to use a spot cleaner to treat this area for effective cleaning. For instance, Clean2Shine has a unique method of doing with the use of hot water in the treatment of these parts on a carpet, and after cleaning, there won’t be telltale signs that the carpet was cleaned.
- Take your time cleaning the carpet until it is spotless
Cleaning a carpet is not something you plan a specific hour of your time for; it is something you make time to do because some carpets can be very stubborn to clean. Depending on the method you plan to use, you must ensure that you do not use excessive water to ensure that you take out all the dirt hiding in the carpet fibres and use ideal cleaning detergents that suit your carpet type.
Whatever method you are using to clean, be it dry or hot method, ensure that your washing is done effectively and it covers all areas that need to be washed. Even after washing, inspect the dirty parts to see if it does not need further scrubbing.
- After Cleaning, Follow the After-Use Instructions
One careless mistake after cleaning can ruin every effort made to keep the carpet clean, particularly if you do not follow the instructions as stated on your products or on the machine used to carry out the cleaning. Therefore, before cleaning, it is advisable to plan effectively so that you don’t accidentally step on the cleaned area while washing or after.
The reality is that whether in a home or an organization, your carpet defines your level of hygiene; therefore, after-use instruction is more important because a single mistake can make all efforts go to waste. Consequently, it is best when you employ the services of a professional carpet cleaning service of a prominent firm like Clean2Shine. Your carpet is in safe hands.
Important Advice while Cleaning your Carpet
Common Problems with Carpet Cleaning
Carpet cleaning is a technique, and that is why it is advisable to hire a carpet cleaner to help you maintain your carpet, so you don’t incur additional expense. Here are the common problems faced during carpet cleaning:
Shrinkage in the Carpet
The main reason why carpet shrinkage occurs is due to too much moisture which has caused it to get too wet during cleaning. Only professional cleaners can determine the amount of water that is needed to wash a carpet during cleaning. At Clean2Shine, we have experts that ensure that your carpet is examined thoroughly before washing and we get rid of moisture through the use of an extractor vacuum.
Faster re-soiling often occurs in carpet cleaning, and this is due to many residues not adequately removed when rinsing. This error majorly occurs from carpet cleaners who are not professional enough in carpet cleaning. They often use too much cleaning agent or too much soap concentration. It often results in unresolved cleaning, which leaves behind some residue that causes faster re-soiling.
As a professional cleaning carpet firm, Clean2Shine ensures that no standard process is skipped to ensure that your carpet does not lose quality after washing. For instance, we often use hot water to get rid of the leftover residue in the carpet, so the chances of faster re-soiling happening are zero.
Bubbles and Ripples after wash
Bubbles and ripples usually show up as the carpet begins to dry-off. Although they fade away as soon as the carpet is dry, it is often advised by Clean2Shine experts to wash your carpet thoroughly because your carpet needs re-stretching before cleaning.
Advantage of Hiring Carpet Cleaner
As a homeowner or company executive, you are responsible for the proper hygiene of your carpet, which is why you should employ a reputable firm that boasts experts in carpet cleaning. Here are the benefits of hiring a carpet cleaner:
Carpet cleaning goes beyond using machines, vanish and vacuum cleaners, you need to understand the carpet texture, the level of water to use, and the best method that clean it up without damaging it. Carpet cleaning is also not about hard work, it is about smart work, and that is why you should hire a professional to clean your carpet. Professionals boast technical acumen allied with consummate experience to ensure that you get the best results every time.
Removing Tough Stains with Ease
Those who have tried carpet cleaning can testify to the neck and back pain that comes with it. A professional carpet cleaner knows how to clean the carpet with tactics that will make your carpet as good as new. The DIY process will leave you drained but carpet cleaners have tough cleaning agents that can remove tough stains without stress.
Prevention of Mold Growth
One of the reasons why mold grows on carpets is due to unprofessional cleaning, which usually involves the use of water to saturate the carpet and not allowing it to dry correctly. This results in mold growth and mildew that can cause complications to health. However, the good news is that professional cleaners like us can do an excellent job on your carpet.
It Saves Time and Money
If you are busy, hiring professional cleaners saves you time and money. You will get quality cleaning that will improve hygiene, whether at home or in the office. The main thing is that it saves you money from buying another expensive carpet, and above all, allows you time to focus on other things.
At a time like this, when we have to do whatever we can to stay safe, a clean and healthy work or living space can go a long way and professional carpet cleaning is a great way to ensure this. It is, therefore, a good idea to invest in a service that practically guarantees your comfort and safety.",<urn:uuid:682a6791-0d74-4d73-b470-a5c0a87816a9>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://clean2shinelondon.co.uk/what-is-the-best-way-to-clean-carpet/,2024-02-20T23:08:59Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9642217755317688,2712,0.9888266324996948,1

Is Gutter Cleaning Important?
Gutter cleaning, while a seemingly periodic job, is tremendously vital in supporting the structural and functional integrity of a home. Gutters, principally made to funnel rainwater away from the roof and foundation, play a crucial part, especially when one takes into consideration the sheer volume of precipitation that can be discharged on a large rooftop. Nevertheless, when debris begins to build up, these gutters can't completely play their protective duty.
Firesafemarin.org states: “gutters are crucial to moving water away from the house.”
What Happens If Rain Gutters Are Not Kept Clean?
Gutters must be cleaned at the very least two times a year to guarantee ideal performance and longevity.
Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District, in their article titled“Gutters and Downspouts: Wetness or Erosion Problems”, discusses the water damage that can occur as a result of poorly maintained gutters.
In colder climates, the water trapped in gutters can freeze. This results in the formation of ice dams, which can damage the gutters and even lead to leaks inside the property by pushing ice under roof shingles.
Moreover, the added weight of debris and trapped water can cause gutters to sag or break away from their attachments. Neglecting to keep your gutters clean can lead to structural, aesthetic, and health issues, emphasizing the importance of regular maintenance.
How Frequently Should Gutters Be Cleaned?
Houselogic.com advises: “Clean your rain gutters at least twice a year.”
Regular maintenance is pivotal to help prevent potential complications that develop from stopped up guttering and downspouts.
Residing in a place with heavy rainfall could demand even more periodic cleaning. As debris, like leaves and branches, piles up, it limits the water flow, risking damage to the property. Seasonal changes further stress the necessity for this maintenance.
The fall season, with its dropping of leaves, frequently calls for an in depth cleaning. In the same way, the after-effects of spring introduces seed pods and blossoms that can jam gutters.
While the standard recommendation is a semiannual cleaning, particular conditions of your environment may well need more regular attention. Engaging reliable gutter cleaning services can offer customized advice based upon the special obstacles of your location. In essence, while cleaning two times a year is a good general rule, you should always be attuned to the particular needs of your home and surroundings.
Guidelines For Cleaning Frequency
If you don’t have any trees around the property, an annual cleaning should be sufficient. If you have several trees, you will need to have them cleaned at least 2 times per year. If you have a lot of trees, you would need them cleaned no less than four times per year.
Industrial Or Commercial Property:
Most industrial and commercial properties are fine with an annual cleaning, but care needs to be taken if there are trees around the property.
Apartment Or Condo:
Our general suggestion for most apartments and condos is to have the gutters cleaned on a semi-annual basis. On average, these types of properties contain more trees than industrial or commercial properties but generally less than residential properties.

How Much Does Gutter Cleaning Cost In Knoxville?
Size of Your Property
The cost of gutter cleaning services in many cases varies depending upon the length of gutters present on a property. Of course, bigger homes with more extensive gutter systems may well incur elevated costs because of the increased work and time required.
Complexity of the Guttering System
A more complex gutter system, distinguished by many different bends, a number of levels, or unique designs, will influence the costs. The level of difficulty rises with complexity, involving specialized tools or methods for extensive cleaning.
The accessibility of your gutters plays an essential part in figuring out the cost. Gutters that are more challenging to reach, perhaps due to landscaping or architectural barriers, can make the job more challenging and difficult, influencing the overall price of the service.
Height of the Building
The height of a property can specifically influence the rate. Gutter cleaning services for taller buildings typically come at a premium, predominantly because of the added hazards and equipment involved to reach higher elevations.
Condition of the Gutters and Downspouts
Gutters in a state of considerable neglect, swelling with debris and sediment, may increase the cost. The reason being, they require more exhaustive cleaning and even minor repair work.
Time Of Year
The time of the year that you have your gutters cleaned out can affect the price of the cleaning due to several factors, including staffing, weather patterns, urgency required, etc.

Important Facts About Rain Gutters and Gutter Cleaning
What Do Rain Gutters Do?
Rain gutters gather water from the roofing system, directing it away from the foundation to prevent future damage. Their major purpose is to look after the home's structural integrity by making certain water drains efficiently, protecting against buildup and the damaging ramifications of mold and mildew. Equally, by preserving a clean channel for water, gutters stop debris like leaves, branches, twigs, and dirt from settling on rooftop shingles.
Theconstructor.org states: “A rain gutter system channels water out and away from the building’s foundation.”
In the US, up to .044 gallons (200 milliliters) of rain can fall per minute per square foot of roof area. On a 2000-square-foot roof, that’s 88 gallons (400 liters) of rainwater per minute!
How Do Gutters and Downspouts Get Clogged?
Gutters and downspouts eventually become stopped up predominantly due to the build-up of debris such as leaves, branches, and dirt. As time go on, these materials collect and slow down the flow of water, triggering backups. Pests and rodents can also add to stoppages, building nests and leaving behind waste. In addition, in cold environments, snow and ice can be an element; as they melt and refreeze, they can slow down the regular water flow.
The reasons for blocked gutters and downspouts are varied, but appreciating them is integral to ensuring effective home care.
What are the Consequences of Clogged Gutters?
Water Damage: Cascading rainwater can damage the home's siding, fascia, and foundation.
Roofing Damage: Pooled water can rot timbered roof structures and damage rooftop shingles.
Basement Flooding: Poor drainage can generate water accumulation around the foundation, triggering basements to flood.
Insect Infestations: Stagnant water attracts pests like mosquitoes, rodents, and wasps.
Landscape Erosion: Overflows can deteriorate gardens and ruin plants.
Mold and Mildew Growth: Wet environments assist in the growth of mold and mildew, which can be detrimental to health.
Gutter Damage: The weight of trapped debris can trigger gutters to sag, pull away, or even crack.
Ice Dams: In colder climates, trapped rainwater can solidify and create ice dams that even further obstruct water flow.
Decreased Property Value: Structural and aesthetic damages caused by obstructed gutters can lower the home's resale value.
Fixing gutter obstructions immediately is indispensable to prevent these undesirable effects on your home.
How Can You Tell Your Gutters are Blocked?
- Overflowing Water: When it storms, rainwater spills over the edges of the gutters instead of continuing through downspouts.
- Sagging Gutters: Excessive weight from trapped debris can cause gutters to droop or bend.
- Stagnant Water Pools: Places of standing water or wet spots near the foundation of your property.
- Birds or Pests: Frequent activity of birds, mosquitos, or insects near your gutters can possibly be a sign of nesting or standing water.
- Visible Debris: Overhanging leaves, twigs, or other debris sticking out from the top of gutters.
- Plants Growing: Small plants or weeds shooting up from the gutters.
- Drips or Sounds: The sound of dropping or trickling water from gutters when it's not raining.
- Stains on Siding: Watermarks, mold, or mildew on the siding of your home, especially underneath the gutters.
- Eroded Landscape: Gully development or eroded landscaping straight below the gutters.
- Peeling Paint: Peeling or bubbling paint on your property near the gutters as a result of consistent water exposure.
A regular cleaning schedule can avoid a lot of the issues linked with clogged up gutters.
What's more, regular inspections in the course of the cleanings can pinpoint probable issues early on, enabling timely interventions. A proactive solution to gutter care not only extends the lifespan of the gutters but also preserves the structural integrity and aesthetic appeal of the whole house.
Do Gutter Guards Help In Reducing Blockages?
A gutter guard is a protective mesh or cover fashioned to prevent leaves, debris, and insects from going into and obstructing the gutters. That being said, while the concept sounds useful, there are negative aspects to think of. First off, the initial expense of installation can be expensive for many homeowners. The second thing is, a significant number of products on the market do not perform as marketed, letting debris to collect or causing water to overshoot the gutters..
Lerablog.org, in their article“The Pros and Cons of Gutter Guards”, states: “If you have a steep roof or valleys the rainwater will likely overshoot the gutter altogether.”
7 Essential reasons to clean your gutters
1 . Prevents debris from causing blockages
Routine gutter cleaning helps deal with debris, assuring appropriate water flow and lessening the risk of gutter damage or overflow that can bring about damage to your residence.
2. Protects your home’s foundation
By keeping gutters clean and operating correctly, a gutter cleaning service provider helps secure against water from overflowing and pooling around your home's foundation, which can lead to structural damage and expensive repairs.
3. Reduces the risk of pests
Clogged gutters can produce a breeding ground for bugs such as rodents, birds, and mosquitoes. Rain gutter cleaning services help to remove these potential nesting locations and keep your property pest-free.
4. Extends the lifespan of gutters
Periodic gutter servicing by a experienced service helps identify and fix minor concerns before they become significant issues, ultimately extending the life span of your gutters.
5. Increase value of your property
Clean and well-kept gutters contribute to the general curb appeal of your property, which can be particularly necessary if you prepare to sell your property.
6. Ensures Safety
Gutter cleaning can be a unsafe undertaking, specifically for property owners who are not knowledgeable in working at heights. Hiring a professional gutter cleaner makes sure the task is done safely and properly.
7. Reduces Water Damage Risk
Properly functioning rain gutters are required for directing water far from your house's roofing system, walls, and foundation. Regular gutter cleaning services help prevent water damage and the capacity for mold and mildew development.

"Now I've signed the contract, I can share that I've sold the reprint of ""A Night of Many Months"" to Pseudopod, although I'm not sure yet when it will be out.
In October I went to Bristolcon, my first SFF con experience. I enjoyed the panels and workshops I attended, and meeting new people, but it was heavy on the socialising (as these things are) which I found very tiring after a while. Especially after getting on the train to Bristol at 7am. It was nice to hang around with other writers for a while, and the entertainment was excellent (ever seen a string quartet play while doing the can can?), but I probably should have gone to bed half an hour, maybe even an hour, earlier and by the time I hit my room I was having a full-blown anxiety attack brought on by overtiredness, poor hydration, erratic eating, and too much input in a short space of time.
So, mixed feelings. I enjoyed it and would probably go again, but don't feel the travel and expense of a longer con, or one further away, would be worth it. I definitely won't be doing Worldcon any time soon!
During the course on Finishing Your Novel, I committed to finishing a novella by the end of November. It's a full rework of an older project, so I have a pretty good idea of where it's going, but then I got sidetracked by a story I'd been stuck on - which was an altogether more appealing prospect than slogging my way through an ill-advised outline (although it was an interesting experiment). Then I got sidetracked by projects at home, and preparing for Christmas, and haven't finished either.
I've got some time off over Christmas, so I'm going to spend the time making plans for next year. There are several projects that need time and attention, and I've got several online courses from The Rambo Academy for Wayward Writers to finish. The days when I could rattle out several thousand words a week are long gone - I no longer have the time or energy (free Thursdays not having panned out so far which is something else to address in the new year), so need to get the best out of what I do have.",<urn:uuid:e7f93b89-16f5-4aa7-9531-888b2ce29dd4>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://clholland.weebly.com/blog/category/sale,2024-02-20T23:18:42Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9863629937171936,476,0.29319682717323303,0

"Browser VNC with Zero Trust Rules
Cloudflare recently released browser based SSH and VNC applications backed by Zero Trust Rules. In this segment, we will demo the SSH and VNC and cover common use cases for these applications.
Hey, good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, depending on where you're at in the world.
My name is Kenny Johnson, and I'm a product manager here at Cloudflare. Thank you for joining.
And I'm here today to talk a little bit about our new browser -based SSH and VNC products that are powered by Cloudflare for Teams with Zero Trust rules.
Really just to quickly set kind of what I'm going to go through today, I'll do a brief overview of what browser-based SSH and VNC are, how it's powered, kind of as well as what's possible using our Zero Trust engine.
I'll talk a little bit about how it's powered by Cloudflare's network.
Then I'll actually go through a demo of these products.
I'll touch a little bit on what the configuration looks like for these individual products, and then we'll get to see them in action.
Awesome, with that, I'll go ahead and step right in. So just jumping into browser-based SSH and VNC, basically how these systems work are that what I'm able to do is taking a non-HTTP app, so either SSH to some kind of server or something like that on AWS or DigitalOcean, or possibly VNC.
What I'm able to do is create a TCP connection to the server where that particular resource lives.
And then what we've done at Cloudflare is we've built code on our edge in WebAssembly to actually render an SSH or a VNC viewer directly in the browser.
A couple of things to note here are that the connection is fully encrypted, so Cloudflare doesn't see anything going over the SSH entries or the VNC session.
However, the other piece that is powerful here is that we are soon gonna be able to add auditability on top of this, so actually giving users the ability to see actions being taken within an SSH terminal or within a VNC browser.
Once that's been configured, then all a user needs is just a browser and an Internet connection, and then they're able to access both a VNC or SSH session.
This is much different than kind of the current status quo where I might be using a machine-based VNC viewer or I might just use my normal terminal to access SSH.
It can be really handy for users, but it can be a really kind of dangerous security vector to leave open because if a user's keys are ever leaked or anything like that, I don't have a ton of control as an admin who's actually SSHing to a particular server.
There's no kind of validation check beyond being able to identify and verify a user's keys while connecting.
This gives you a lot more control and visibility over who is accessing, when they're accessing, what device they're accessing from, as well as additional controls and enforcement on the actual access to these particular resources.
And these are all backed by Cloudflare for Teams.
So this is backed by Cloudflare Access, which has been a well-established product that powers Cloudflare Zero Trust Control to applications.
So you're able to plug in multiple identity providers, device posture or device security posture signals.
So does the device's serial number fit in a certain list?
Are they running CrowdStrike? Checks like that, as well as contextual factors.
So looking at the IP address that it's coming from, user's country, you're able to build really granular policies for these applications to dictate who can and cannot access that particular application.
And I think one of the most important distinctions and why this technology wasn't necessarily possible in the past was that latency would be a huge concern.
If you were trying to render an SSH terminal with a centralized data center or just a few data centers spread across the globe.
If as a user, I'm trying to perform very latency-sensitive key stroking on an SSH terminal or use a VNC browser, or I'm actually dragging and dropping things and my mouse is taking forever to move because I'm having to backhaul traffic to a data center halfway across the world, that's just not an acceptable user experience.
What makes Cloudflare really unique is that we have a vast edge network of over 200 data centers across the entire world.
Meaning that we're less than 100 milliseconds or within less than 100 milliseconds of 99% of Internet connected users across the world.
This allows us to deliver these experiences really efficiently because both the SSH and VNC terminal render completely at our edge at the data center nearest to the user.
So there really aren't latency controls that would be a concern in kind of in days past.
Awesome, so now what I wanna do is I wanna actually go ahead and take a look at what the configuration and setup looks like for both the SSH and VNC terminal or VNC browser based applications within Cloudflare.
So I'm gonna go ahead and start in Cloudflare for Teams.
So just to quickly orient you in Cloudflare for Teams, there's two core components within Cloudflare for Teams.
There's gateway, which is our secure web gateway product that's for web filtering, not super relevant today, but I always just like to touch on what's involved in this dashboard.
The piece that is gonna be super relevant is Cloudflare access because Cloudflare access is basically the gatekeeper or the controller over who can and cannot access these particular resources.
And this is where we go ahead and actually set up the initial connection and the policies for who can access these particular resources.
So I'll go ahead and start with my SSH application. So I have just a basic hostname or subdomain against a domain that I own, that I've set up and configured to render an SSH browser session.
What I've done to configure this is I'm just basically specifying that I wanna render this as an SSH session.
I'll get into kind of what's going on in the backend of the particular server that I'm exposing in a moment as well.
But the next piece that I wanna do once I've specified and said, I want this application to be a browser-based SSH terminal is now I wanna actually dictate who can access this particular browser-based SSH session.
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create an access policy.
And in this case, I've created a very basic access policy.
I'm saying that I want to only lock down and allow my employees.
So anybody with an at Cloudflare email address can access this particular resource.
If I wanted to, I could do additional things like look for a certificate, look for filter for specific countries.
I'm able to be really granular in defining these policies.
I'll quickly kind of step through what's possible within access, just in terms of groupings.
So the first piece is just some basic location and network context.
So based on a user's country, based on an IP range, signal like that, as well as identity information.
So this comes from various identity providers that you can hook into access.
So these are things like email addresses, membership to specific Okta groups, additional SAML claims, things like that.
And really the final area of signal is device posture. So this can be something like I issue a token to the machine, I put a certificate on the machine, or I can actually check device posture of that particular machine before allowing access.
So are they running Cloudflare's Warp Client? So is there traffic being encrypted?
Do they have Tanium or SentinelOne or CrowdStrike or any kind of any major endpoint protection provider running on that machine before I want to allow access?
Or is the device's serial number in a list of managed serial numbers that I set up and configure within Teams?
So I'm able to be very, very granular with exactly how I want to allow and which users I want to allow access into these particular applications.
Once I've configured the policy, I'm then also able to configure which identity provider I would like to actually allow access to for that particular application.
So this is the access policy side and kind of that configuration side.
The other side of the setup is on the actual server that I want to expose via SSH or VNC.
So in this case, I've actually set up just a DigitalOcean server.
So I'll go ahead and pull that up. So I just have a DigitalOcean droplet. I'm powering both my browser-based SSH and VNC session out of this same droplet.
So what I actually am able to do within DigitalOcean is using a product called Cloudflare Tunnel.
I'm able to create a secure outbound tunnel connection to Cloudflare's edge.
So pulling up a console within DigitalOcean, I'll actually pull this up in my browser-based SSH in a moment as well, but I'll start quickly here with DigitalOcean's terminal just to show you what's going on underneath the hood.
So using what's called Cloudflare Tunnel, Cloudflare Tunnel basically creates a secure outbound tunnel connection to Cloudflare's edge.
It allows you to basically route traffic from Cloudflare into a particular server, and then I can lock that server down so no direct traffic can reach that particular resource.
So what I've now done is I've created a tunnel using our daemon called Cloudflare-D.
I called it DigitalOcean-VNC or DoVNC. This gave me a specific tunnel ID, and then you can see it's created multiple persistent connections to the closest colos or to the closest data centers to my location.
So in this case, or in this case, it's actually the DigitalOcean's infrastructure's location, which they're in the Bay Area, so we're getting San Jose and LAX.
So I've got two redundant connections to each of those data centers.
The next step is I need to take this tunnel that I've just created and hook this up to the particular DNS record that I want to expose the SSH application through.
So if I go ahead and step back to the Cloudflare for Teams stash, we can see that I want to expose this via digitalocean-ssh.kennyatx.com.
So then my last step here is within Cloudflare DNS.
I want to go ahead and map my DigitalOcean SSH subdomain to the Cloudflare tunnel instance that I've created.
So this Cloudflare tunnel instance that I've created is now mapped to digitalocean-ssh.kennyatx.com.
So now I've got it all hooked up to where I'm able to, and there's one additional configuration step I'll actually show you when I get into the browser-based SSH as well.
So what I'm gonna go ahead and do is now I'll go to, here, I'll go ahead and do it again.
I had it on the other tab. So I hit digitalocean-ssh.kennyatx.com. And what this did is this took me to a Cloudflare access login screen.
So now I'm able to see the specific identity providers that I've set up and configured.
One additional note, if you ever like to use it, this actually can be a really, really good use case if you have external users or contractors who you would like to grant SSH access to.
What we can do in access is we can actually set up and configure a one-time pin for those users or an option to do that.
So if a user exists in a particular policy, say I want to put a certain contractor domain or very specific contractors into an access policy, they're then able to enter their email here to receive a one-time code.
So I don't have to worry about onboarding them to my Okta instance or bringing them into G Suite or trying to onboard their G Suite org into my identity management system.
I can just do a really kind of quick and dirty one-time pin to be able to grant them access to this particular resource.
So what I'm gonna go ahead and do now is I've got my SSH application here.
I'll go ahead and log in through Google, log in via my Cloudflare account. And if you remember, how I had it set up was my policy was allowing anybody with an app Cloudflare account.
So I passed that policy check because I used my Kenny Johnson at Cloudflare.com.
If you have any feedback on this, feel free to email me if you want.
I have that email within my access policy. So now what I'm being prompted to, this is just my own DigitalOcean infrastructure now prompting me for my access management credentials.
So I'm gonna go ahead and log in just as my root user.
One additional note is we actually support short-lived certificates. So you can put a certificate on your machine and this just will automatically take you straight through to your SSH session.
In this case, I'm just using a password.
So I'll just go ahead and log in with my SSH password within DigitalOcean. And now I'm actually being presented with my SSH terminal directly within DigitalOcean.
So just to make it super clear too, I can go ahead and pull up my droplet in DigitalOcean and you'll be able to see the, let me go ahead and grab that.
I can pull that up and you'll be able to see kind of the IPs and everything match up.
So it's definitely that you can see I've got, I'm now in my DigitalOcean account, just pulling this up now.
You can see that IP address matches up. And really the benefit now is in order to access this, what I can do is I could create really granular and locked down firewall controls so that nothing can access this droplet except for connections over this browser-based SSH connection.
And so the piece, the kind of the final piece that I wanted to touch on in terms of configuration on the Cloudflare D side, I always like to do it this way because then I'm actually able to do this configuration directly in my browser-based SSH terminal.
And it helps kind of show off what I'm doing or how I'm able to use this particular application and kind of how great the latency is and things like that.
So what I've done or what I'm gonna show you guys now is I'm gonna step into Cloudflare D, my Cloudflare D directory, which basically Cloudflare D is just a really lightweight daemon that you can install on pretty much any server, any operating system.
So Linux, Mac, Windows are all fine. And that then gives me a command line interface to create tunnels, add routes to tunnels, things like that.
So stepping into my Cloudflare D directory, you can see I've got some configuration or a certificate to go ahead and authenticate some additional metadata information.
And then I also have a config file. And the config file is where I'm actually defining and configuring kind of the last step of creating these inbound connections for these particular applications.
So I'm gonna go ahead and open that configuration file up and just kind of talk through what's going on underneath the hood.
So within this YAML config file, what I'm able to specify is which ports or which services I want to map to which particular host names.
So this is where I'm able to say on a given server for SSH over port 22, which host name do I wanna go ahead and map that to?
So in this case, I actually am mapping that to do-ssh.kennyatx.com.
And you can see I've mapped it to localhost port 22, which is the standard SSH port.
So that is then giving me the ability to now make SSH calls directly in the browser, which I'm doing here.
So it's kind of an inception right now.
I'm using the tunnel that's powered by this config file to look at the config file of this tunnel.
But this really does give me a lot of flexibility to now manipulate anything that I need directly within my DigitalOcean server, all directly from the browser.
And then kind of a final benefit or a piece that is already baked into the app within Teams is this authentication request that I've made is now going to be logged as an access login event to the Teams dashboard.
So you're gonna be able to see, here's my request four minutes ago.
And this is really powerful information if you think about this.
Traditionally, SSH is something that's completely driven from a user's machine.
I have to do a lot of heavy lifting on my origin server side or my network configuration side, either via a hardware-defined network perimeter or an agent on the user's device or things like that to actually monitor and log the traffic coming over SSH or VNC for a particular user, or really any non-web -based application.
So in this case now, without anything installed on my machine, I'm able to see my access to that particular SSH console.
So we can see that I hit, I'm calling my app SSH Grafana because that's a droplet that I've got Grafana hosted on.
I can see which user did that, where their IP address was, what domain they used, how they connected.
So I can see that I logged in over Google, as well as the country that that request is coming from.
So you can imagine, you can start to build pretty granular policies or build exception reporting around things like logins from anomalous countries or block bad IPs, really things like that.
What I'll mention as well is that all of these logs here, these access request logs, these can be used with Cloudflare's log push and log pull products.
So if you have a SIEM tool or a security event and incident management tool like Splunk or Datadog or something like that, you're able to push these events directly into your SIEM and then build alerting off of those.
So now what is traditionally a blind spot and a very powerful blind spot, think about what you can actually do with SSH with the right permissions on a particular server.
You can really bring that into visibility now. You're able to see and build reporting and alerts around user access to particular resources over SSH.
So that's the SSH side.
So the final piece that's coming around SSH that is something we're still working on a bit of a proof of concept on, but just kind of as a roadmap sneak preview is we're working on the idea of SSH command logging or SSH session recording to where we'll actually be able to provide a mechanism to replay the actions that a user took directly within an SSH terminal.
Because Cloudflare is rendering this terminal at our edge, we do have the ability to actually log the requests being made.
So you could imagine in a situation where you have a really significant security incident where something went wrong, either an outside actor took some bad action or was able to breach or an internal user acted maliciously, the ability to replay their session and see exactly what they did on a particular origin server becomes really powerful in piecing together the kind of the scope and breadth of a particular compromise.
So this is something that we're working on over the summer.
We should hopefully have some details coming out over the next few months.
So keep your eyes peeled on the blog and on Twitter and things like that, because we'll definitely make some exciting announcements around that piece as well.
That's a piece that I'm just generally very excited about and I geek out about because it's just such a kind of massive security vector that I think we'll be able to help out with.
So this is the SSH side of things. If it's interesting to actually set up, if you wanna go ahead and give this a try on your own, Cloudflare for Teams is free to try for up to 50 users.
And what I'll actually make a plug for is directly within our developer documentation in our tutorials, we have a very clear tutorial about how to set up an SSH client in the browser with Zero Trust rules.
And this starts completely from scratch. You just basically need some server that has access to the Internet.
So it could be something on the public cloud.
You could use AWS GCP, kind of something like that, DigitalOcean, all the way down to if you have a Raspberry Pi that you've got connected to the Internet at your house, you should be able to do that.
I think we actually even maybe have, I think there's a blog about that piece.
If you search our blog and look for connecting a terminal via Raspberry Pi, you should see that as well.
Excellent. So what I'm gonna go ahead and do next is I'm going to now take you guys quickly through VNC.
A lot of the same principles apply, but this was the next step in the evolution of our browser -based Zero Trust apps.
I will throw in a bit of a tidbit.
It's probably not gonna be our last. We're thinking about additional non-web, traditionally non-web based applications that we could possibly bring to the browser as well.
Think things like RDP or SMB file shares. If you have ideas on that, feel free to tweet directly at me at KennyJohnsonATX or at Cloudflare.
Let us know your thoughts.
If there are things you'd like us to consider, I'd love to hear about those.
But we definitely think that there's broader applicability. So the next protocol that we set up and created was VNC.
So VNC is basically, if you're not familiar, it's an open source way to render a browser.
Traditionally, I would use an on-premise or a machine-based VNC viewer that would allow me to render a remote desktop from either somebody else's machine or a server.
This now brings this experience to the browser as well.
So very similar to SSH, I am defining a subdomain that I want to go ahead and map to a particular VNC application.
I've defined some set of rules.
In this case, I think I'm just allowing Cloudflare, but again, I could build really granular policies down to does a user have a hard key plugged into their machine?
Is the device corporately managed? Things like that. And then the final piece is instead of SSH, now I've selected VNC as the browser rendering option.
So now if I go ahead and pull up a new browser and go to dovnc .kennyatx.com, and then I'm going to go ahead and just, this is my VNC side password again, similar to the root kind of login that I did for SSH.
Now this actually gives me a browser-based VNC option.
So I've got now just a, this is literally just a, I think it's Ubuntu or Debian.
I can't remember which Linux disk image I chose, but this is basically my Linux UI now that I'm running and using directly over the browser.
So I can actually just go ahead and run it. I can actually open a browser within a browser.
I think I probably have a firewall rule locking that piece down. But what's also fun is I could do like a terminal within a terminal.
So now I have my web, I have a web-based VNC powering a terminal.
So there's a lot of powerful things that I can start to do with a remote-based desktop like this.
This helps me provide a very kind of secure means of using a desktop interface for either external users or users in sensitive countries, or really users working with really sensitive secure data.
This gives me a lot of flexibility in deploying and providing those particular resources.
So one nice thing here as well is this just typically works with most popular VNC deployments.
This is just using TypeVNC, which is just a free open source VNC package out there, but we've tested it pretty broadly across a number of different VNC deployments.
It can sometimes be a little tricky to get your VNC configuration properly configured, but once you have that properly configured, we've had a lot of really good success with these particular, with VNC deployments directly within the browser.
And again, this is just works.
Desktop interfaces are very latency dependent. So this is something that, since this is being powered by the edge, my connection right now, this is just going and hitting Dallas Fort Worth.
This is really fast. I'm not seeing a lot of drag in my mouse.
It's the user interface is reacting really quickly, which works out well.
And I'll say there's also possibilities for doing things like screen recordings in the future, because we're rendering this in the browser.
We could do things like replaying user actions for certain key events.
That's a little farther afield than what we're considering for SSH command logging, because replaying video and GIFs and things like that might be a little bit more of a challenge, but it is definitely something that we're thinking about.
And we'd love to hear people's thoughts on kind of how that might be useful in their businesses or just kind of daily life, if you want to go ahead and create browser-based VNC options.
And then we'll, we again, we'll be able to see in the access logs, my request being made to the VNC instance.
So again, it's just really powerful in terms of being able to see users accessing this, who accessed it, which identity was tied to the particular application.
Another kind of interesting piece that we've seen with these browser-based tools is collaboration.
I can actually share this particular desktop with another user at the same time.
So there's opportunity to collaborate in the same desktop.
If somebody else signed in, they'd be able to see me moving my mouse around, dragging these things around.
So it opens up some collaboration use cases as well.
And if you want to go ahead and get started with VNC, similar to SSH, I believe we do have, yeah.
So we have the option as well to render VNC through a browser.
And because VNC is a little bit trickier to get up and going, than SSH, we actually start with kind of bare metal, just getting started with type VNC from scratch.
However, if you are going through and setting this up and you already have an instance of VNC that you like and enjoy, you actually can just, you can skip this first step and then you just basically need to point your VNC server to Cloudflare, create the Zero Trust rule that I showed off, and then you should be ready to roll.
Excellent. And I think the piece that I really just want to reiterate is that this is free to try.
You can go sign up for Cloudflare for Teams. I'll show you guys what that website looks like.
Cloudflare for Teams is free up to the first 50 users.
So just, if you just go to Cloudflare.com slash teams and click on get started, that'll help you sign up and get configured with a Cloudflare for Teams dashboard account.
If you're an existing Cloudflare user, if you go into the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the dash, I'll show you quickly where that lives.
If you just go into your main dashboard view and scroll down to the right and select teams, that'll launch your team session as well.
And it'll just take you through some basic setup steps.
And again, it's free up to the first 50 users. So we really encourage you to give this a try.
The browser-based SSH and VNC are just kind of a small sliver of what you can do with Cloudflare for Teams to bring kind of enhanced Zero Trust security to your team.
So I really encourage you to check it out, give it a try, put it on a website, put it on your staging website, give it a go.
Well, thank you all so much for joining my session to kind of hear about what we're doing with browser-based applications.
Stay tuned. We are just getting started.
And again, my name is Kenny Johnson. Feel free to reach out on Twitter, LinkedIn.
You can probably find me there. Thank you all so much and enjoy the rest of y'all's days wherever you are in the world.
Thank you so much. Thank you.",<urn:uuid:e06185ae-1266-43c5-b43e-24b39ddac46e>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://cloudflare.tv/event/browser-vnc-with-zero-trust-rules/PZ5EBmZ2,2024-02-20T23:27:48Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9629445672035217,6056,1.7158392667770386,2
"This Week in Net: Bug bounties, attacks on health organizations and Groundhog Day
Welcome to our weekly review of stories from our blog and other elsewhere, covering a range of topics from product announcements, tools and features to disruptions on the Internet. João Tomé is joined by our CTO, John Graham-Cumming.
In this week's program, we discuss our bug bounty program that led to Cloudflare's handling of a bug in interpreting IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. We go over the uptick in targeted DDoS attacks on healthcare organizations and ways to stay protected. We include topics like the traffic control bug CVE-2022-47929, and new features such as Advanced HTTP Alerts and the ability (for administrators) to manage dedicated egress IPs with Cloudflare Zero Trust.
There’s some talk about North America’s Groundhog Day (including references to the 1993 Bill Murray movie and also current Internet trends).
Lastly, Rita Kozlov gives us a brief guide on what to expect from the Cloudflare Workers platform in 2023.
Read the blog posts:
- Cloudflare's handling of a bug in interpreting IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses
- Uptick in healthcare organizations experiencing targeted DDoS attacks
- CVE-2022-47929: traffic control noqueue no problem?
- Get notified about the most relevant events with Advanced HTTP Alerts
- Manage and control the use of dedicated egress IPs with Cloudflare Zero Trust
Hello everyone and welcome to This Week in Net, February the 3rd, 2023 edition. I'm João Tomé, based in cold Lisbon, and with me I have as usual our CTO, John Graham -Cumming.
Hello, John. It's not that cold, João. It is cold, it is cold. Alright, it's cold for Lisbon, and I've got a jumper on.
Yes, yes. And I have a shirt, which is like the most usual thing for me.
We had a few blog posts this week. Last week we spoke about Data Privacy Day and all sorts of blog posts.
But this week we have different types of blog posts we had in the blog.
Why not start with one that does a reference also to our bug bounty program?
In this case, it shows how it was really helpful, right?
How it made an impact. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, so Cloudflare has a bug bounty program through HackerOne, which a lot of companies use.
And if a security problem is found outside the company, it can be reported through there.
And we have bounties, i.e. we pay a certain amount of money to individuals when they find bugs.
And some of those security bugs are very complicated, and some of them are relatively simple.
And depending on the impact, there'll be a larger or smaller bounty available.
This particular blog post you're talking about is a write-up of something that was discovered by someone outside the company back in November.
And we fixed it very quickly, but we hadn't actually written it up.
And we try to write up problems, security problems, outages, all that kind of stuff for the blog.
So the team wrote this one up. Before we go into the details of it, if you scroll down in here, there's actually a timeline, which I think is kind of interesting.
And so if you look at this, 27th of November, evening time for us here in Portugal, somebody reported this in through HackerOne.
And we triaged those reports pretty rapidly. There's a team of people looking at reports coming in internally for things and also externally for things.
And about, I think it's about sort of 15, 20 minutes later, our on-call CERT, our Security Incident Response Team, was paged by the folks handling the bug bounty.
So about 20 minutes after the person reported this problem, we paged them.
The manager of the on-call got together. It was declared as an incident about 40 minutes after the bug came in from the outside.
And about an hour, I think an hour and 30 minutes, sorry, two hours afterwards, we had a hotfix ready and we started deploying it.
So it was a pretty rapid turnaround. We look at the severity of a problem and we try to get this stuff out very quickly.
And by the next day, so by a day later, we had a permanent fix out there and it was fully merged within a day.
So if you look at this sort of start to finish, it's like two days to go from somebody reports something problematic to a permanent fix merged and rolled out worldwide, but actually only a couple of hours before a temporary fix, which stopped the problem, was actually rolled out.
So when you look at how we handle these things, we tend to move pretty fast.
And hopefully, you can see that the processes we have there.
Now, if you go back to the actual bug, back at the beginning, it's rather interesting.
So if you're not familiar with this, obviously your computer has an IP address and it also has something called a loopback address, which is basically saying, me, I want to talk to my own computer.
Perhaps the most well-known is 127.0.0.1. And we don't want any DNS records to be able to point to the loopback address because we don't want any systems that are controlled outside of Cloudflare, by our customers, to be able to talk to internal machines.
And so we block all that kind of stuff. Now, IPv6 also has a concept of loopback address, but it also has a way for backwards compatibility to embed an IPv4 address in an IPv6 address.
And this is what this weird thing is here.
So that loopback thing, 127.0.0.1 in IPv4, becomes this thing, colon, colon, f, f, f, colon, 127.0 .0.1 in IPv6.
And an external script researcher managed to realize that we hadn't done a good job of mapping, of blocking, basically loopback when it was using an IPv4 address embedded in an IPv6 address.
And that allowed them to cause one of our bits of software to contact the local loopback address, which could be very dangerous because it could be internal services running on there, and we would like to make sure that they're not contactable at all.
So that was the bug, and we very, very rapidly fixed it. But this is, I think the big message of this is that we really love our bug bounty program, and we love the things people find, and the folks who report them, many of them are really fascinating bugs that they find, and it helps make us more secure.
Yeah, there's a little bit of information about how it happened. So it was done using Cloudflare Workers, and a specially crafted DNS entry.
Makes sense. And one of the things, so in this case, actually, when is declared an incident?
So when are we sure that it's an incident and we should look more into resolving it?
Well, actually, anybody in the company can, using our chatop system, declare an incident.
You can just type it into our chatop system that you're raising an incident with a priority and the reason why, and that kicks off an entire process with a chatroom created, a Jira created with information about it, paging to the on-call incident commander, et cetera.
So we have a pretty low bar for that. I think the last incident that I raised was actually for the death of Queen Elizabeth, because we were worried about how traffic was going to shift on the Internet once we knew that she had died, and that could have caused us a problem.
It didn't actually cause us a problem, but I decided it would raise an incident, and other people can.
So in this case, I think it got raised because there was the possibility of someone being able to write a worker that could contact an internal machine at Cloudflare, and you want to make sure that that's not possible.
The interesting thing about this is obviously we fixed it, and there you go away, but actually the reason why was a mismatch in how IP addresses were getting parsed, and so what was happening was one bit of software was saying, this is an IPv6 address, but it was emitting internally the IPv4 address, and then the other system was saying, well, this is an IPv6 address, but it was actually an IPv4 address, and therefore it didn't match the deny list, so it didn't actually get blocked.
So it's one of those things where two bits of software, like an impedance match between two bits of software, and this is the sort of thing that security researchers are often really good at finding is this kind of unintended consequence, and so that was a blog this week.
Exactly, and it helps avoid problems for sure, so those are important.
Absolutely, and it's nice to write them up, and people can see the sorts of things that you deal with and how you deal with them, and if you do find something, please report it to us.
We're very grateful, and there may well be a bounty involved.
Exactly, so you can earn money by helping us.
Yep. This week there's a lot of talk on, in this case, healthcare organizations experiencing targeted DDoS attacks, and this was related to some concerns about one group, one hacker group that is well -known of creating problems, and we pushed a blog post out just focusing on that specific topic, right?
Yeah, I think we had seen a group that claims to be this pro-Russian group called Killnet, it's a little hard to know if it is actually them, but it claims to be them, targeting healthcare organizations, and what we see is targeting them with HTTP DDoS attacks, and so knocking offline perhaps access to systems within a hospital or information about the hospital, and we've just seen an uptick of that in the last couple of weeks, since the beginning of January actually, and maybe this is related to the conflict in Ukraine, it was a little bit hard to know, but just notable that for some reason hospitals and other healthcare providers had come under attack, and we showed what we were seeing from our perspective, we do obviously protect a number of hospitals around the world, a number of healthcare organizations, quite a large number, and we left some information there about how people could prepare and how they could get a hold of us if they need to protect something that's under attack.
Exactly, and in this case, we also explained why DDoS attacks are used in this way by these types of groups, because they are in a sense easy to use, and we also explained how everyone can prepare better using our systems in order to avoid these types of problems, because they are avoidable, but if you run into this type of problem, and in this case it's a hospital, it has a really urgent need to have access to those systems, this can create real harm, so it's important to be aware of that.
So we also have this message of those, if someone is under attack, we can help, and we have a specific page for that purpose also.
Yeah, and by the way, if you do contact us when you're under attack, that isn't a sales call.
We're not going to tell you, oh, by the way, this is how much you need to pay us for us to fix the problem.
We will get the site or the service back online, make sure that it's stable, and run like that before ever talking about the cost of it.
And so what typically happens is we get people up and running, and then we let it settle down, and then we'll have a conversation, do you want to continue with this service, but not, if you're under attack, we will get you back online.
Yeah, that's important, especially in this type of situation, healthcare, those providers, that will make a world of difference for sure, just resolving the problem and don't think about anything else.
We had more blog posts this week.
Where should we go in terms of blog posts you want to mention? Well, let's go to this, it's very complicated to say CVE 2022 blog post because that was kind of a fun one.
And it's all about a bug in this case. Yeah, a bug which turns out to be a denial of service in Linux.
And so this is only one if you really, really want to get into Linux internals and get kind of nerdy about something.
But basically what happened was we had noticed there was sort of a bug to do with Linux namespaces, in particular user namespaces.
And we had actually noticed this, but we thought, oh, yeah, well, that's a bug, and we reported to it, reported it.
And then it didn't seem very important at the time. Actually, we went off and we notified the kernel.org mailing list to say, oh, by the way.
That was June, right?
Was that in June? I think that's about right. It sounds about right. No, I think it was actually, I think it's even longer ago than that.
I think it might be like March of 2019.
I think it's like ages ago. We're like, oh, by the way. We wrote about it in June, so possibly it was before that.
I think it was 2019. We were looking at using what's called queue disciplines in Linux to move around packets and actually in particular to do some stuff to do with token buckets so we could decide how much traffic goes to particular locations.
And there's this thing called no queue, which essentially is meant to pass packets on, but they're meant to be just to get dropped, basically, which is helpful for us.
And there was this thing in documentation which said, oh, by the way, you can't set these up on physical devices.
And we're like, well, I wonder what happens if you try to.
So you run a bunch of Linux commands and you get a kernel panic, a null pointer dereference.
And this was back in 2019. We're like, oh, well, okay. So, you know, so what?
So we should report it. Report it to the mailing list. Didn't seem very, very important.
Okay, fast forward almost three years, and we're doing a lot around user namespace hardening.
And we were like, wait a minute, remember that bug?
Can this, you know, can we do that?
Can we use user namespaces to do this? And it turned out we could. And it turned out we detailed how this happens.
And so, you know, there's a patch. We published a patch for this.
We have some takeaways about how to harden your systems against this kind of bug because it would be possible in the right circumstances to set something up that on receipt of a packet, you get a kernel panic, which you would not like because that's a denial of service.
So this was a pretty deep dive, nerdy post about a bug we found that turned out to be a serious bug that turned into a patch to its kernel.
Just a question, in terms of how many bugs like these there are.
So bugs there are a lot. But they have different scopes, in a sense, right?
I mean, I don't know the answer to how many didn't get written up as blog posts.
I mean, if you go to the kernel mailing list, you'll see lots of things getting reported, right?
And so little things. It's just that this is one we ran across in our work because we're obviously very interested in hardening our use of Linux.
And, you know, we reported it, and there it is. And that's a patch. So it's a good one to have.
Where should we go next? We also have two blog posts from today.
We do. We have a couple from today. These are product features. So one of them is advanced HTTP alerts.
And basically, you know, we give people alerts on traffic to their properties behind us.
But we've added some pretty detailed alerts where you can configure them.
This is something that our enterprise customers can use if they want to get very, you know, very, very specific alerts about, you know, traffic patterns or traffic volume or errors or stuff like that from our system.
So it's a nice new feature, and it's good if you're managing something complicated on Cloudflare.
Yeah, you can get a better perspective of what's happening, in a sense, too.
Another one is about egress IPs in Cloudflare Zero Trust. So, of course, the Zero Trust platform is all about, you know, you authenticating to the applications, to the services that you use, and then we can apply rules around who you are and where you are and what your device is and give you or not give you access to the thing, to the service.
But there are some applications still around that want only to be accessed from a fixed IP address or a fixed range of IP addresses, which is a little bit of an older process, but still, you know, it happens.
And, you know, they sort of consider this to be like a sort of second factor.
You know, it's John's logging in and he's coming from this IP address. So we have dedicated egress IPs for this.
And, you know, if you need it, you can now manage that within our system.
So this allows you to set up a policy that gives you access from specific IPs for specific applications.
And that is sometimes important for the way applications are built.
And it's prepared for this hybrid way that we have now.
Different types of systems, different types of usage of services, right?
Yep. I mean, there's all sorts of ways you want to connect to our systems and IP addresses.
Well, that's one of the ways some older systems needed. And there's a Portuguese example here, which...
Yes, there is. But Montijo here in Portugal.
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I wonder what they were testing in Montijo. But yes, absolutely.
It could be a Portuguese IP you need to access the system from.
You never know. Exactly. It could be very specific and also next steps for those who are interested in this situation in specific.
In terms of blog posts, I think these were the ones we had this week and the ones we already had mentioned last week.
In general, we're already in February. So the year is already coming along.
Can we share something about our next innovation weeks or next types of things to share?
I don't know about the next innovation weeks. They're coming.
We're working on them. I'm going to keep that as a bit of a spice. But I saw you tweeted a graph of Groundhog Day.
Can we bring that graph up? That was kind of cool.
We can. Let me find it. Here it is. Mostly, at first, I'm a big fan of Groundhog Day because of the movie, of the Bill Murray, Harold Ramis movie.
And so that movie, for those like me who live all this life in Europe, I'm not accustomed to Groundhog Day.
And that movie gave me the highlight of Groundhog Day but also gave me one of my favorite movies for sure.
So it was yesterday. Listen, you and I totally disagree about this because I had never seen Groundhog Day until about two months ago.
Oh, no. And I was like, I'm going to watch this movie. It's such a classic American film.
I really, really need to see it. And I watched it and I was just like, what is this film?
It's so weird, right? It's just weird. I mean, I like Bill Murray.
I like Andy McDowell. But I was kind of like, okay. So anyway. It's definitely like a dark humor type of thing.
So it's not for everyone. But for me, it's like really important because it allowed me to see how a comedy can be.
So less comedy and more dark and more philosophical.
So it feels like philosophical because the day is always repeating itself.
And this week, there was a study that someone did, don't know why, related to that movie actually, the Bill Murray movie.
And the study said that in order to learn all of what the Bill Murray character learns when the day repeats itself, the day had to be repeated like 12 ,000 times.
So that would mean 33 years of looping the same day, always the same day, for him to learn like piano, things like what he learned.
So in terms of being an expert in different areas. So that's a weird thing that popped this week.
You are way more into this than I am.
I saw the film one time. I was like, okay, great. I've seen it. It was fine. But I'm not going to go into an analysis of how long it would take him.
I think maybe you should be a moderator of a subreddit dedicated just to Groundhog Day.
You're a big fan. Anyway, what happened? I guess there are websites. Exactly.
So these are Groundhog Day websites. There are a lot. And mostly what we saw was an increase, no surprise there, when the Groundhog made his prediction.
It was around 7.20 Eastern time.
And we saw at that time, around that time, 16 times increase in DNS traffic to those websites.
And the peak was a few hours later, like 2 p.m.
Eastern time. So that's mostly the story that we were able to tell with our data.
You've buried the lead here.
So Punxsutawney Phil, did he see his shadow or whatever the tradition is?
I'm not even sure I understand the tradition. He sees his shadow or not, and then his spring is going to happen, or I don't know.
You explain it to me.
I'm not an expert on the tradition itself, but from my understanding of the news, he saw the shadow.
And that means there's six more weeks of winter.
So that's the theory. And anyone can see if that theory will hold up.
So hopefully Phil will be on the spot here. But there are other Groundhogs. So Phil is not the only one.
Shall we set a date six weeks from now? You and I come back on this week in net.
But did we have six more weeks of winter? Because as you were saying, it is a little chilly in Lisbon.
Maybe we do have a bit more winter coming up.
Maybe. I'll put on my schedule, because if not, I will forget it for sure. But yeah, just one very specific trend here.
Any other type of suggestion you want to give more nerdy for our audience?
More nerdy? Wow. What are you reading these days?
Okay. So I'm a big fan of a French graphic novel series. This is hyper specific.
It's called Blake and Mortimer. It is in French, and it's about two very British heroes of the 1940s and 50s and 60s who are protecting the empire from all sorts of things.
It's totally ridiculous. And I love it partly because it's in French, and I read it in French.
Also, it disperses lots of English words and is totally outdated at this point.
It's sort of so old-fashioned. But they keep producing these two characters, David Blake and Mortimer.
And Philip Mortimer, who is a Scottish scientist, also a pretty good boxer as well.
Philip Angus Mortimer. That's a good one.
A very specific one. It's very specific. He didn't expect this, but yes, they're sort of playing on this archetypal British gentleman.
Philip Mortimer is both a gentleman, a scholar, and also quite good at boxing as well.
And Francis Blake is that dashing guy in the trench coat there with his uniform on all the time, who happens to also run MI5.
So there's also a relation with Tintin, right?
Tintin in Portuguese. Yes, because I think that the guy who originally created it got going because he was involved with the comic in which Tintin was published.
I've never been a Tintin fan, but there we go. But Blake and Mortimer, I just find it dashingly British.
The villain, there is a perpetual villain, the Colonel Ulrich.
I'm not quite sure where Colonel Ulrich comes from, but they never managed to quite get rid of him.
He's always coming back. So that's what I'm reading.
There you go. You asked. You did ask. I did ask. But it's always a good suggestion.
For me, I'm not reading nothing right now, to be honest. I'm in between books, but I'm seeing The Last of Us TV show on HBO that comes from the video game.
And I'm kind of surprised because I played the video game before a couple of times as a journalist.
I was testing things like video games sometimes. I'm not an expert on video games.
The video game was fine, but I'm not a very big fan of video games.
To be honest, I'm a much bigger fan of the TV show because it's very dense and long.
And you don't need to understand or like the video game to like the TV show, which I think is a good value there.
And there's only three episodes because HBO does it like I like, like one episode per week.
So you can digest each and every one of those episodes.
And one of the writers also wrote Chernobyl, the TV show, a good one.
And one of the things I like, they do this thing.
If you want to explore more about the show, and the show is a little bit philosophical also, in some sense, they have a podcast.
So anyone can hear a podcast specifically with the creators of the show, which I found interesting.
And you're a big podcast fan.
I'm a big podcast fan for sure. I don't remember the last time I listened to a podcast.
You must start to hear the This Week in Net podcast, which is available.
Is there anybody good on it? I heard sometimes there's a good show there.
Let's hope it continues. Yeah, but mostly that was a suggestion I want to give.
We had a few time. And next week, more blogs, more things to see on blog.Cloudflare.com.
That's right. So more things to see. And I'm going to give you a shout out to another Cloudflare page that you might not have looked at, which is research .Cloudflare.com.
And that's the research team, which is on my team.
And they work with standards bodies and universities on long term stuff.
And that's actually another fascinating place. If you've run out of content on blog.Cloudflare.com, the research team is here.
And you can read about a lot of very interesting stuff going on there about helping to build a better Internet.
Exactly, publications. And even recently, I did two interviews with visiting researchers that come from university.
And you can watch them on Cloudflare TV.
So there you go. And another suggestion there. Yeah, the site is research.Cloudflare.com.
And anyone can see it. And I think we're out of time. Thank you so much, John.
Thanks very much. Stay warm. You too. See you next week. Yeah, bye-bye.
And because we still have some time, here's from Rita Kozlov, our Senior Director of Product.
In a conversation I recorded for our segment, We Are Cloudflare, where she mentions 2023 and what to expect in our workers platform.
Just a few areas that I think we're always focused on. The first is always ensuring that the developer experience is as good as possible.
And we like to think that we're best of class today, but that's never good enough.
And so I'm looking forward to sharing some of the big developer experience improvements that we have coming.
I think observability is going to be a pretty big theme for us. And I think that's a really big part of developer experience, right, is making sure that you can not only write the code, but also that when things go wrong, you're able to understand what's happening and where and dive into it.
And quickly, right?
And quickly. And quickly. And quickly. Giving developers access to one of the constant areas of growth for us is giving developers access to more tools.
We want you to bring as much of the full stack to us as possible, right?
And so last year or a couple of years ago now, we announced R2.
Last year, we announced D1. And so continuing to kind of build out those building blocks, I think those are all really important directions.
And then, yeah, continuing to see the community grow and would definitely encourage anyone to join it, whether on Discord or interacting with us on Twitter.
I promise we're very welcoming.",<urn:uuid:18f62aaa-b437-41f1-8ac3-466b58deca50>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://cloudflare.tv/shows/this-week-in-net/bug-bounties-attacks-on-health-organizations-and-groundhog-day/zaGK89a2,2024-02-20T21:37:23Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9830325245857239,6285,1.2480015754699707,1
"Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, in a bid to force Michael Dell to sweeten his $24.4 billion buyout proposal for Dell Inc., said he’ll come up with a higher offer for the PC maker by Friday morning.
The new bid will be “vastly superior” to the founder’s offer, Icahn said Thursday on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart” with Trish Regan. “We’re going to come in and add into the package — which we think is superior already.”
Icahn, who holds an 8.7 percent stake in Dell, has been agitating for months to try to force Michael Dell and buyout partner Silver Lake Management LLC to sweeten their $13.65-a- share offer. His latest plan would offer Dell shareholders $14 or the ability to retain equity in a publicly traded portion of the company — rather than the buyout group’s deal that takes all the shares off the table for outside investors.
The increased offer will include a warrant, Icahn said.
“We think the warrant will be around $20, to buy the stock at $20, and we’re going to give the shareholders a piece of that warrant,” Icahn said in the interview. “We think that will make it definitely superior. We think, after talking to a number of shareholders, that this should win the day for us. But you can’t be sure obviously.”
This would be the fourth effort by Icahn to scuttle Dell’s buyout. In March, Icahn offered $15 a share in cash for as much as 58.1 percent of the stock. Then, in May, he teamed up with Southeastern Asset Management Inc. to offer investors $12 a share in cash or additional Dell stock while letting them retain stakes in a public company. Last month, he offered to help finance the last $14-a-share buyback proposal.
Shareholders are set to vote on the Silver Lake-led offer next week, after an earlier effort by Icahn to block the deal in Delaware court failed. The court argued that Icahn’s offer can’t be superior to Michael Dell’s because it’s not a full takeover.
Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. recommended Dell shareholders vote for the $24.4 billion buyout by Dell and Silver Lake. Glass, Lewis & Co., another shareholder adviser, also backed the buyout proposal. A vote will be held at Dell’s Round Rock, Texas, headquarters July 18.
“From a public company shareholder’s perspective, if your CEO is willing to buy your falling knife for the privilege of catching it, there is probably a price at which you should let him,” ISS said in its July 7 report.
In a letter to Dell shareholders, Icahn urged them to seek a higher price for their shares in court, by exercising so- called “appraisal” rights available to shareholders of companies incorporated in Delaware. An October closing date for the deal would give investors until December to decide whether they want Dell’s price or a court appraisal, he said.

"FORTUNE is going international!
FORTUNE will be the opening performance during next year’s CPH STAGE Festival in Copenhagen.
This year’s opening show is the strong and vibrant performance FORTUNE. A true tour de force of passion and movement that takes us on a journey through India like a road movie, illustrating the wonder of life with a chain of images, impressions, and moments.
In FORTUNE, the dancers and the musicians each go in the search of the meaning of the wonderful gifts of life. On stage we see a big tree of life with junk hanging from it – symbolizing how happiness is not about material goods.
CPH STAGE’s intention is to connect the people of Denmark with the voices of the world through art in a time when there is most need to get a deeper understanding of who each other is.

"Often in life, it’s the things we love most that can be the most frustrating. As a little girl, I’m sure my wife must have prayed to find a man who could cross only one eye, and yet she becomes frustrated when after a passionate kiss, she opens her eyes to find one eye looking longingly back at her and the other pinned against my nose. I tell her she looks “twice as beautiful with my eyes crossed,” but that rarely helps ease her frustration.
And so it is with wine. The thing I love most about wine is the communal aspect. It comes in large bottles designed for sharing with people. Yet, trying to find a bottle to please everyone at your party can become a headache.
So here are some tips:
Go Light. When people say they don’t like red wines, they often cite the bitterness caused by the tannins. (Tannins are also found in tea, which can lead to that mouth-puckering bitterness when over-steeped.) Pinot Noirs and other grapes like, Gamay (found in Beaujolais), are lower in tannins. Look for California Pinot Noirs which tend to be more fruit-forward then their European counterparts.
Go Old. As vines get older, they produce less fruit. So, the fruit they do produce tends to be concentrated with flavor. Wineries are proud of these wines and will often put “old vines” on the label. Now here’s the trick, old vines can produce big, bold reds which can be a turn off to some of your guests, so try to find old vine wines that have an alcohol level around 13.5%. These are usually medium-bodied fruit-driven wines with soft tannins.
Pinot Gris- Pinot Gris, or Pinot Grigio as it is called in Italy, is a crowd-pleaser. Pinot Gris offers flavors of lemon and lime, along with green apple and stone fruits. It isn’t as acidic as Sauvignon Blanc, or as big or oaky as a Chardonnay. There’s a lot to like, and not much to dislike.
Note: While they are the same grape, Pinot Grigios typically have more subdued fruit.
For the Sweet Drinkers- If you have one sweet drinker in the bunch, while everyone else enjoys dry wines, things just got complicated. If you don’t mind going a little sweeter than what you would typically drink, try a German Riesling Kabinett. This should have enough sweetness to appease your guest, but have enough acidity to cut through the sweetness. Otherwise, just stick with the pinot gris, chances are by the end of the second glass, they will like it too.
One last thing, if you are asking people to try a wine that they wouldn’t drink on their own. Prepare them. When I was little my dad told me to close my eyes and open my mouth. He gave me an olive. I love olives, but I was expecting candy, and that olive tasted awful. Taste the wine ahead of time, pick out the prevailing fruit, then as you hand them a glass, say “This is so good, it tastes like ______.” If a person is used to drinking something sweet, many wines come across as tart or bitter, so their immediate reaction will be one of disgust. By saying “This tastes like green apple” it gives them some context for what they are about to taste. I mean, who doesn’t like green apples?
Final tip, when all else fails, make Sangria.

"So you decided to give Scrivener a shot but found the interface quite daunting, right?
Don’t worry, you’re not alone. It’s common for many writers to start rolling their eyes when they first come across the busy interface of Scrivener.
That’s why most of them either drop out or spend cold hard cash to learn the program.
But why would you pay someone when you can learn it for free?
Yeah, you heard that right! In this post, I’ll show you how to make the most out of Scrivener step-by-step on both Windows and Mac.
And by the time you finish this article, you’ll have a complete grasp of most of the functionalities of Scrivener, writing on it, editing and creating versions, and finally, export in your favorite format.
So, you ready? Let’s get going.
Scrivener is not as complex as it looks. It’s pretty easy and intuitive once you get the hang of it.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
How to get started with Scrivener
Before we dive deep, it’s important to let you know that the swamped interface of Scrivener is merely a mirage.
Because 99.9% of the time, you won’t need most of the functions. It takes only 5-6 tools to create a ready-to-publish piece from scratch.
So, my focus will be on these essential tools so you can get a concise roadmap to use the software. You can ignore other features as most of the authors do.
Let’s get started by getting familiar with the different functions of Scrivener.
As soon as you open the Scrivener app, it asks you to create a project by giving it a name and selecting a template from the repository.
Unless you’re working on a novel or screenplay, choose the blank page, name your project, and hit ‘create’.
Once you create the project, it takes you inside the app, and this is what you come across:
A blank page with lots of icons around it. Starting with the menu bar at the top, let me break down everything section-by-section.
At the top we have a menu bar that consists of:
- In the left side, you see standard menus like ‘File’, ‘Edit’, ‘View’, ‘Insert’, etc. to go to different functions. But don’t get intimidated because, in Scrivener, the only time you would visit this part is when you want to import or export files or if you want to take snapshots (I’ll come to it later).
- Just beneath the menu options, we have a toolbar with a handful of icons. Again, the only tools we are going to need is the “Full-Screen” icon and “Compile” which is second from right and extreme right, respectively.
- In the middle of the bar, we have different modes of Scrivener where the left icon is for ‘Editor Mode’, the mid one is ‘Corkboard’, and the right one is ‘Outliner’. We’ll talk about these three modes in detail in the “How to organize content” section.
- And finally, at the right side, we have a tiny search bar to search within a document or project. And a big blue ‘i’ icon that opens the inspector pane.
Now, coming down to the left portion of the interface. You see a panel called ‘Binder’. Binder is the control room of your project.
It’s divided into three categories:
- Draft: This is where all your actual writing is stored.
- Research: As the name suggests, the place where you can store all your research notes, images, and even web pages.
- Trash: The place where all your deleted files end up in. It’s like the ‘Recycle Bin’ of your computer.
Binder is basically the navigation bar of Scrivener where you can create or navigate through all the sections of your document.
At the bottom, there’s a gear, folder, and document icon.
While the folder and document icon can be used to add a separate folder and document to the project respectively, you can use the gear icon to rename an existing document or folder, and also to send it to trash.
Now, we have conquered the left panel, shift your focus to the right where the inspector panel is waiting for us. You won’t be able to see it until you click the big blue ‘i’ icon on the top right corner.
Once you click on it, it opens a whole different set of features that might make your head spin for a while.
But fret not, it’s not as messy as it looks.
The inspector panel has three different sections.
1. Synopsis: You can write a short description of a particular chapter or section of the project.
2. General Meta-Data: This section is handy if you write multiple drafts of your novel or screenplay in the same project. That way, you can add labels (as Chapter or rough) and status (like first draft, second draft, finished, etc.) to your documents. Otherwise, keep it as is.
3. The third section depends on which function you choose from the toolbar just above the Synopsis section. By default, it remains in ‘Notes’ that opens a yellow text box at the bottom where you can enter all your notes on the go while writing. It looks something like this:
Besides ‘Notes’, it has the ‘Reference’, ‘Keyword’, ‘Custom Meta-Data’, ‘Snapshot’, and ‘Comment & Footnotes’ sign.
While the Reference tool enables you to add a local file, folder, or webpage for future reference, ‘Keyword’ lets you tag specific keywords to your files. It is useful when you have a pile of documents, and you are looking for a specific one.
Just enter the keyword tagged with that doc in the search box, and it returns all the files tagged with that particular keyword. It narrow down your search and save time. Its neighbor feature ‘Meta-Data’ also performs similarly.
However, I would advise you to ignore the Meta-Data’ part to simplify the whole writing and organizing process.
Next to the meta-data field, there’s a camera icon that denotes the Snapshots section. This is where you can find all the snapshots (I’ll talk about it in a moment).
And finally, at extreme right, you can find the comment tool that allows you to add comments as well as footnotes to your doc. The process is the same as you do in Word or Google Doc.
Select a word or phrase and click ‘+’ in the top right corner to add a comment.
If you want to remove it, hit ‘-’ and the job is done. As simple as that!
At last, it’s time to explore the minimalist bottom bar.
As you can see in the picture above, there’s nothing special here to mention. In the right side, there’s a small circle (looks like a dartboard) that lets you set a maximum word limit for a particular document.
Use it when you’re working on a blog post or short story that has a specific word limit associated with it. Otherwise, I don’t prefer touching it.
The mid section of the bottom bar indicates the total number of words written in the current doc. And in far left, you have the option to bump up the size of fonts.
And finally, the big white space is where all the action happens.
The text formatting pane is just above it, and it’s the same ordinary one that we see in any word processor. And in the far right, you have the facility to split the screen vertically or horizontally.
When should you do it? I’ll let you know in a moment.
So with that, you are now fully aware of the Scrivener interface. I hope it won’t haunt you anymore.
Now you can start doing what you’ve bought it for: write and organize content.
How to start writing content
You can either start typing words right away or import your existing work on Scrivener.
Since it supports almost all the popular formats, you shouldn’t face any issues importing your files even if you’ve written it on Final Draft (another screenwriting app).
Go to File, select Import from the drop-down menu, and click ‘Files…’. Select the file you want to work on and click Import in the next window.
Within a few seconds, your chosen file will be there on your Scrivener screen.
In case, if you want to add some quick notes while writing, open the inspector pane by clicking the blue ‘i’ icon on the far right, and dump everything there.
However, keep in mind that you can add only text notes. You can’t insert images or add webpages.
For that, Scrivener provides you a dedicated section in the Binder pane marked as ‘Research’.
Right click on it, point over Add, and click ‘New Text’. It’ll open a document where you can store all your notes whether they’re images or words.
It also lets you keep webpages. All you need to do is repeat the same process, but instead of ‘New Text’, pick Add webpage and enter the URL and title in the new window and click ‘okay’.
The funny part is, you can access the webpage even when you’re offline.
Now, you might be wondering, “Hey, do I always need to flip back and forth between my research and writing doc while working?
The answer is no.
Whenever I write a piece that requires heavy research, I always split the screen vertically, and while the left part shows my actual writing; I keep my research doc open on the right side.
And how do I do that?
Simple, just click on the white space inside the right side screen and click on the research doc in Binder. It’ll open that doc on the right side of the screen.
This is how I save at least half an hour every day and keep my momentum going. And I would recommend you to follow the same steps unless you want to waste hours jumping between multiple docs.
Now many of us have this habit of working on sessions, and we set a goal to write a specific number of words in one go.
Scrivener knows it very well that’s why it lets you create sessions and monitor word count if you go to Document > Project Target.
Set a specific target according to your capacity and click okay.
I love using sessions whenever I work on a long-form blog post like an ultimate guide or an eBook.
It helps me finish long writing assignments in a short time without feeling overwhelming.
And you know the best part?
Scrivener saves everything automatically. So there’s no chance of damage even if you forgot to hit ‘Ctrl S’ after a rigorous writing session.
Similar to Sessions, I can’t imagine writing without the Full-Screen mode of Scrivener.
Because personally, my focus game is so fragile that I can get distracted even by the ping of a notification.
That’s why to block all these interruptions and of course, to escape from the jam-packed interface of Scrivener, I turn the full-screen mode on by clicking on the arrow icon.
It blurs the background and pushes it backward, so the only thing you see is the current page you’re working on.
Additionally, you can control how much screen the page captures and how blurry the background should be by increasing or decreasing the paper width and background fade at the bottom (just move your mouse to the bottom, and it’ll show up).
Now the question is:
How can I have my notes on the same screen when the full-screen mode is on? Do I need to go on and off full-screen mode just to confirm a source or take a quick look at my notes?
Again, the answer is no?
Hover your mouse down and click on the inspector (i) icon and there you go. You have all your notes next to your writing doc.
And just beside the inspector icon, you have the ‘Go to’ option, that takes you straight to your research docs or any document while the full-screen mode remains intact.
So this is how you can make full use of the full-screen mode. And once you’re done writing the first part or chapter, always write the next chapter or section in a different doc.
Don’t worry about how you’ll export all the bits and pieces together because when you hit ‘compile’, it’ll stitch the whole document together.
So create a new text file by right-clicking on your current doc in the Binder, hover your mouse over Add and click Add New Text.
It makes the organizing part a breeze. Wanna see how?
How to organize content
Scrivener’s ability to organize content is the primary attribute that separates it from other software.
Before I show you how to use this power, take a quick flashback to the first section where I introduced you to the three different modes of Scrivener – Editor, Corkboard, and Outliner.
This is where these three modes come handy.
It doesn’t matter where you’re organizing your project; there’s only one way to do it – drag and drop.
When you’re in the editor, shift your entire focus in the Binder panel.
It contains all your documents, so select the one you want to change, drag it, and drop it where you want to place that section.
For example, if you want to interchange the spots of section 5 with section 3. For this, select section 5, drag it, and drop it between section 2 and 3.
If you drop it just over section 3, it’ll become a sub-section of section 3. So, always drop the document beyond the section that you want to replace while arranging docs in editor mode.
If you find it challenging to arrange documents in Binder, Corkboard could be your favorite place to organize content.
It lays out your entire project as index cards where each card, has the document title on it with a synopsis (if you’ve added any).
Again, select a card, drag it, and drop it over another card to exchange their spots. You can see these changes take place in the Binder when you shift again to editor mode.
And finally, the Outliner mode is where you will find the headings and subheadings of your project as a spreadsheet.
It’s similar to the ‘list view’ we see on our computers. To re-arrange different sections, perform the same process you do in Binder.
Yes, not just drag and drop over the section, but go a little further.
And that’s how you organize your content in Scrivener. Just remember three words – ‘drag and drop’.
How to create versions and export
It’s a common scenario for a writer to spend an hour writing a paragraph, scrap everything out in the next moment. Write another paragraph, and finally scrap out that para too to go back to the older one.
It’s damn annoying to go back and forth between different versions when you’re not sure about the perfect copy.
But with Scrivener, it’s a breeze.
If you’re not sure about the latest version of your document, save it as a snapshot and use it later, in case the future copy doesn’t turn out as per your expectation.
Go to Document > Snapshot > Take a Snapshot.
In a second, it stores the current doc as a snapshot. Similarly, you can take as many snapshots as you want, and you can find all of them in the inspector panel under the Snapshot section (yes, the camera icon).
If you want, you can rename each snapshot by double-clicking on it. And when you select one (single-click), it shows the copy in the text box below.
If a particular version seems a better fit for your project, hit ‘Roll Back’ in the top-right corner, and it’ll restore that version.
At last, when the editing part is done, you are ready to export your documents in your favorite formats.
One of the significant benefits of using Scrivener is, it makes formatting effortless.
For example, if you format your document on MS Word for e-reading devices, it may take hours depending upon the size of your document.
But with Scrivener, it takes seconds.
Go to Compile and in the pop-up wizard choose an appropriate format in the ‘Format as’ field- for example, ePub and Mobi for eBooks, print-ready PDF for paperbacks or the plain Word document.
Next, choose a format in the ‘Format for’ field,click Compile.
And within a minute your file will be there in your desired folder.
Now, you’re free to send that doc to your publisher, editor or even to your friend; the choice is yours.
If you are on the market for an app that allows you to export from Google Docs to WordPress in 1-click, then we recommend checking out Wordable. It will not only clean and properly format your HTML, but also compress images, open links in a new tab, automatically set featured images, or create a table of contents, and lots more.
Wow… that was easy, ha!
Scrivener is not as complex as it looks. It’s pretty easy and intuitive once you get the hang of it.
Of course, there are other features that I didn’t cover in this post, but the real question is:
Do you really need them?
Not even the pro authors use all the features of Scrivener. They stick to most of the tools we discussed here.
In fact, I’ve also been using Scrivener for the last couple of months, and even I don’t know when was the last time I added meta-data to my documents or used the collection tool.
So fret not.
Go through the entire tutorial while keeping the Scrivener app open for faster learning and you’ll be able to tackle any writing project successfully.

Millions of lives have been affected by the actions and work of Black people of African descent. Many people know little of this history. When we become aware of it, we see more accurately the important part Black people played in developing modern society.
The individuals in this article made Responsible Choices that brought good into the world. They initiated or created processes and inventions that saved lives, established opportunities for ethnicities to work together, labored to build God’s shalom and unity among ethnic groups, and helped eliminate discrimination. I am so pleased we are acknowledging and celebrating a few of their actions.
Enslaved Onesimus was a gift to Puritan minister Cotton Mather from his congregation in 1706. Onesimus told Mather about the centuries-old tradition of inoculation practiced in Africa. Mather persuaded Zabdiel Boylston to experiment with the procedure when smallpox hit Boston in 1721.
Onesimus’s traditional African practice was used to inoculate American soldiers during the Revolutionary War, introducing the concept of inoculation to the USA. (See www.pbs.org/video/benjamin-franklins-tragic-association-with-inoculation-ldjsc.)
Dr. Daniel Hale Williams practiced at a time when Black people could not receive care at White hospitals, and Black doctors and nurses could not practice at them. Columbia University Irving Medical Center reports:
Determined that Chicago should have a hospital where both [B]lack and [W]hite doctors could study and where [B]lack nurses could receive training, Williams rallied for a hospital open to all races. After several months of hard work, he opened Provident Hospital and Training School for Nurses on May 4, 1891, the country’s first interracial hospital and nursing school.
Provident also was the first Black-owned and operated hospital in the USA.
George Graves and William Fuller, appointees of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, succeeded in creating congregations made of White and Black people in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Although challenged by racial prejudices and the mindsets of the day that cautioned against interracial engagements, both men expressed the desire to take the gospel to all and to engage with other religious groups. Graves wrote:
In the name of Jesus Christ, let all Christians unite, and let us as ministers of Christ gather people together, high and low, rich and poor, to the glory of Christ and the benefit of humanity.
Harry Passman was among the White converts William Fuller baptized into the church. Because of his Jewish heritage, Passman represented the Reorganized Church in Palestine throughout the 1920s.
Garrett Morgan in 1912 invented the “Safety Hood and Breathing Device,” which came to be known as the gas mask. Also, after seeing an automobile collide with a horse and carriage, he invented an automatic traffic signal and sold the device to General Electric. Today’s modern traffic signal lights are based on his design.
Dr. Charles Drew in 1939 developed a technique that dramatically increased the shelf life of blood and plasma. His development of the blood plasma bank has given a second chance of life to millions.
Pauli Murray’s vision was for a society that valued diversity and rallied around common human virtues. A graduate of Yale Law School, Murray’s written works profoundly challenged the legal foundation of racial discrimination and contributed immensely to the dismantling of segregation and discrimination. The first Black woman ordained as an Episcopal priest, Murray also co-founded the National Organization for Women.
This minuscule bit of history helps dispel myths, inaccuracies, and damaging omissions that distort perceptions about Black people. Individuals recognized in this article focused beyond themselves and demonstrated courage, perseverance, and commitment to live their unique callings. Facing tremendous challenges, they each made Responsible Choices that were for the good of all.
Their accomplishments show how all of society benefits when individuals are able to develop their talents and have their gifts received. Hopefully, awareness of these stories will expand our appreciation and celebration of the rich diversity of history and inspire us to make choices for the good of all, even when challenged.",<urn:uuid:c07d3b35-3c77-499a-8dce-a8f888861b3e>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://cofchrist.org/article/black-history/,2024-02-20T23:24:47Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9584199786186218,887,3.5028772354125977,4

"Does your website look great on mobile phones, tablets, desktops, or a giant projector? If you can’t answer “yes” to all of these questions, your website isn’t responsive. You’ll need a responsive web design partner to make it happen.
Responsive Websites From Start To Finish
What Is “Responsive Website Design”?
You know it when you see it. Responsive web design is when a website is easily navigable and recognizable on any device or screen used.
If you have a presentation to do, and want to show your website on a 10-foot diagonal projector screen, it should look stunning. If you want to show a potential client your site on their iPhone 3G from 2008 that they still have for some unknown reason, it should look good on that too.
To make a responsive website, you need an expert. That’s where Cohlab comes in.
You can’t know the size of every device that will visit your website. You can’t predict what future screen sizes will be created either. So you won’t be able to set a specific pixel or inch cut-off for when the website will make changes to it’s layout.
That’s why proportional changes are extremely important to responsive web design. Assigning a proportion of the screen to your website sections allows them to flex slightly as different sized screens visit the site. Then, set a hard cut-off at a specific pixel width where a different set of proportions take over, i.e. sections no longer sit side-by-side but stack for mobile devices.
In this way, while you can’t predict future screen sizes, you can give each class of devices a website layout which works best for them, while flexing between similar-sized screens without loss of functionality or design.
Similarly to proportional changes, you can convert your menu from a header of items into a drop-down hamburger-style menu, where a single tap or click drops a menu list down over the website, allowing for easy navigation while not cluttering a small screen.
Easily the most important part of a responsive website is speed. You have to have a fast website which quickly recognizes the size or type of device being used, and adjusts the responsive web design on the fly.
Besides – the point behind responsive web design is to make the experience great for users of every type of device. And every type of device loves a fast website.
Your images will need to be highly-curated. In order to work in a responsive web design, images must be high fidelity to not become blurry in larger screens, while maintaining a small size to increase your website’s speed.
Images should also be well-framed, to ensure must-see content isn’t cut-off in various screen sizes and remains centered.
Responsive Website Tech
Learn how we at Cohlab design responsive websites, what platforms we use, and tools we use to audit responsive websites.
Responsive Website Design CMS / Platforms
Trustdyx Responsive Websites
Cohlab’s very own Trustdyx CMS was built from the ground-up right here in Central Minnesota, by Minnesotan hands and Minnesotan minds.
While Trustdyx’s main feature is high security, it is also a natively responsive website platform, purpose built to be lightweight and mobile-friendly out of the box.
WordPress Responsive Websites
WordPress is the most popular CMS platform in the world, with more than 35% of the internet using it to power their websites.
While WordPress websites are popular and vary widely in design, we use a tried and tested custom theme which is flexible enough to handle any screen size.
Responsive Website Tools
‘Toggle Device’ In Google Chrome Dev Tools
While the website is still in testing phases, you can test your responsive website within Google Chrome’s website development tools. Using the “Toggle Device Toolbar”, you can view your test website using a variety of devices, from the Motorola G4 to iPhone X, iPad Pro, or Samsung Galaxy Fold.
You can also set it directly to “Responsive” and then adjust the pixels to the screen you may be testing for.
Once the website is live, you can definitely test it across an array of devices by borrowing them from friends, or asking friends or coworkers to complete specific tasks on the website. This can give you a broad range of real user feedback.
Google Lighthouse Audit
After a website is live, running a Google Lighthouse Audit through both the Desktop and Mobile options can help you better understand where you can improve your responsive web design most.
A Google Lighthouse Audit looks at performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO from Google’s perspective of search results. They want the best of the best, so when you run a lighthouse audit from their emulated mobile device, you’re going to get great advice on code and script fixes you may never notice with the naked eye.
Responsive Website Design FAQ
How do I make my website responsive?
If you’re creating a simple website, some DIY website providers will be able to be responsive out of the box. If the website you’re planning is extensive in any way or needs special features, you’re going to want to partner with a responsive web design firm who can build a responsive website from the ground up.
Does Google prefer responsive websites?
Yes, definitively. Google knows that most website visits and searches are done via mobile device, and have been for years. Therefore, a website which looks good and is easy-to-use on any device is going to be preferred to a desktop-only website. You cannot win in search results with a non-responsive website.
How can you tell if a website is responsive?
You can test the website yourself by using a desktop computer and a mobile device to see if it’s just as easy to use on both.
Or you can scroll up on this page to the “Responsive Website Tools” section and try one of those.
Where are some responsive website design examples?
See more examples of responsive web design on our Portfolio page, but here are a few:

"Friend.tech has spread out to the entire Crypto community on X platform like a storm. It has been getting attractions, capital inflows, and bringing opportunities for everyone involved.
So, what exactly is Friend.tech?
What is Friend.tech?
Friend.tech is a new social app built on Base, the new Layer 2 network from Coinbase which was launched recently. The app allows users to tokenize their social network. In essence, people can sell “shares” of themselves, and these share owners can privately chat with the person they own shares in.
To initiate engagement, users must acquire an invitation code and link their X accounts (formerly known as Twitter). Upon satisfying these initial steps, users are required to inject a minimum of 0.01 $ETH into the Base network. The deposit grants users access to the Friend.tech application and its array of features.
How do people monetize with Friend.tech?
There are currently two ways to make money with Friend.tech
- “Buy low and Sell high” shares of others
Users can choose to join certain channels, earning a share of the selected channel by paying the base price. This base amount serves as the participation fee. If users later decide to leave the channel, they can liquidate their group shares.
By this method, whenever a user buys a share at such a price and sells it higher, he would profit from that trade, and vice versa.
- Own a quality account
The fee on Friend.tech is distributed as follows:
- 5% of the share price goes to the Friend Tech treasury.
- 5% of the share price goes to the person that you’re buying or selling the share from.
Obviously, the more dynamically a share is traded, the more revenue the share owner receives. Some of the top accounts have now generated up to $27K in revenue.
Friend.tech also distributed “points” for users every Friday. It’s still unclear what actually contributes to getting these points, but supposedly it’s mostly based on the fees you generate by buying and selling shares.
Several Friend.tech statistics
The below statistics are cited from our homemade source on Dune.
Until now, there have been over 1M cumulative transactions on Friend.tech, making a total of over $6M in fees.
The market has been so dynamic these days with over 50K transactions per day, whereas the figure last week had only been around 15K transactions.
More and more traders are participating in Friend.tech, making this app hotter than ever.

"To enable a number of emerging applications, efforts from industry and academia have started to focus on defining 6G systems, in which more stringent requirements than those imposed on 5G systems are being considered. In particular, some 6G applications may require extremely low-latency on the order of 0.1ms, through which practical designs of channel coding can be investigated based on Finite-Blocklength Coding (FBC). In this paper, we focus on a joint FBC scheme over multi-user downlinks in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), in which only several symbol durations are available for users within a requirement of extremely low-latency. Since a higher coding rate is obtained by enlarging the blocklength of FBC, we jointly encode users' data bits over their allocated resources, through which an enlarged blocklength is attained. Specifically, we first formulate the multi-user joint encoding design with a matrix-based method. Then, we present the optimal power-constrained throughput within the extremely low-latency requirement by formulating a nonlinear bipartite matching problem. We finally demonstrate the benefit resulting from the joint FBC in terms of each user's maximum obtainable distance. With the distance to each user varying, we also perform an analysis of the variation of the optimal power-constrained throughput.

"Centenary message from Fr. Kevin O’Neill
It is with much joy and heartfelt gratitude that I, on behalf of Columban missionaries and co-workers invite you, our benefactors, your families and friends, and the people among whom we live and serve, to join us in our Centennial Year celebrations which commenced on November 23, 2017, on the Feast of St. Columban.
The theme for our Centennial is “Sharing gospel joy.” The missionary spirit of God burns in the hearts of all of us wherever we live across the world and so together we celebrate our call to be missionary disciples of Jesus sharing gospel joy in our world today.
During our centennial year we give thanks to our founders Frs. Edward Galvin and John Blowick for their missionary zeal and vision to found our Society. From our beginnings in Ireland, Columban missionaries now work in countries across Asia, the Americas, Oceania and Europe. Today many of our new vocations come from these continents.
In a spirit of gratitude, we give thanks for what has been and for our mission today. We look forward to our unfolding participation in God’s mission into the future with trust and hope.
We pray that people will continue to respond to the Holy Spirit’s invitation to join us on mission as Columban priests, lay missionaries, co-workers, benefactors and volunteers.
We give thanks to YOU for your continued generosity and prayers over the years. You and your loved ones remain in the thoughts and prayers of all Columban missionaries across the world.
We wish you all God’s abundant blessings and good health now and in the future.

He takes the Surfer to Earth as a demonstration. He says the populations of the universe are growing incredible and people are living longer. They are only setting themselves up for population disasters and their own extinction. He shows Surfer the future of a destroyed world.
He then takes him to the planet Salaria. The inhabitants are peaceful creatures that do nothing but reproduce. He estimates that in the near future the planet will resort to famine and cannibalism. This further proves that all planets are part of the imbalance. What he plans to do for Death is destroy fifty percent of the universe's population.

"Lebanon is now in the throes of a deep political and economic crisis that had been brewing for years, and the communication industry is hit hard. Naji Boulos, founder of Jicebe Creative Consultancy, former Managing Director of Memac Ogilvy Lebanon, and past president of the IAA-Lebanon chapter gives a harsh but realistic assessment.
What is the impact of the current political/social crisis on the advertising and media industries?
Following years of economic mismanagement, Lebanon is facing dark days and the impact on all businesses is catastrophic. For the advertising industry, it’s a disaster – something that we have never seen before. 2020 will be the worst year since the end of the [civil] war [in 1990].
In the past, the industry always recovered quickly from market turmoil, because there was hope and the Lebanese were confident in their future. But today’s deteriorating economic conditions and the deep financial crisis are strong signals that the economy will take time to recover. This crisis is enormously damaging consumer confidence, the workforce, and companies’ cash flow and bottom lines. It will need months to get back to normal.
What’s the estimated drop in ad spend?
For the first time in more than 22 years, in 2019, Lebanon’s estimated advertising spend in media went below $100 million, a drop of 40% from $150/160 million; and since the beginning of the crisis [in October], we are witnessing a [additional] 90% drop. The [next] government will have an enormous challenge to regain market confidence and boost the economy.
What are the economic mechanisms behind the crisis?
To understand the situation, we need to draw a parallel between 1987 and 2019, both years that saw the Lebanese pound (LBP) crash.
Tracing back the events between 1975 and 1987, it is evident that, despite the ongoing conflict, the Lebanese economy was stable and people’s spending power remained relatively constant. In 1987, however, things took a turn for the worse all of a sudden. The dramatic devaluation of the Lebanese pound, coupled with a high inflation rate, presented a serious danger to the wealth of individuals and companies, who then sought refuge in the US dollar, using it as a replacement for the LBP as a means of exchange and even as a unit of account. Advertising became one of the first services to be ‘dollarized’ in late 1987, which proved to be a successful bid to create stability in the midst of a 730% hyperinflation of the LBP. Against all odds, by 1988, the market had improved.
Today, the situation is completely different. Due to a shortage of dollars in the market, banks are maintaining a certain level of dollars liquidity to buy imports. People are going back to using the LBP. If the pegged exchange rate, in place since 1997, is still LBP1,507 to $1, the real price of the dollar climbed to LBP2,500 to 1$, creating a 50% inflation in some categories – mainly food.
Under these circumstances, advertisers have other priorities than spending their money on advertising – like securing merchandise, paying salaries and other expenses.
How are different players affected? For example, are independent agencies more exposed than international networks?
The crisis started well before October 17th; most of the agencies had already taken some strict measures to downsize their operations. The revolution accelerated the process even further.
Multinationals can manage to survive by outsourcing their services to their network or by servicing clients outside Lebanon. This is probably the only way to sustain their operations. What worries me is that the majority of historical regional agencies are not owned by Lebanese admen anymore, so the emotional link with Lebanon doesn’t exist anymore. Today, holdings are under tremendous financial pressure and Lebanon is not a priority market anymore.
Independent agencies will have more difficulties in the short term due to the volatility of their revenue scheme. Some have already downsized their operation or cut salaries by half. There is no other way.
What strategies can industry players put in place to survive this crisis?
Creative agencies have to find ways to export their services, which is doable as they have a double competitive edge: talent and prices.
Media is in a more difficult situation because they cannot rely on foreign revenue unless they change their business model. The list of [media] closures in 2019 (even before the revolution) is dramatic: Future TV, LDC TV, Al Moustakbal newspaper, Femme, Noun, Elle Oriental, L’Officiel, Snob Hasna’ magazines, Al Jaras radio, to name a few. The few print media that are still available should fight for their survival by asking shareholders to provide financial support until business gets better. However, since print advertising is in decline worldwide, print media should push their digital versions further.
The situation in audiovisual media is odd. Viewership increased by 107% during the first weeks of the revolution, but this didn’t materialize into more revenue for the obvious reasons listed above. The threat is that TV stations will rely more and more on political financing and funding.
Radios are in a slightly better position and might survive because of their low operational costs and by cutting their expenses (canceling most of the programs).
Outdoor companies should drastically reduce the number of billboards in the streets – Lebanon is one of the most cluttered outdoor scenes in the world, with thousands of panels – with the double objective of decreasing their expenses (rent and municipality license fees) and lowering the supply to increase market prices.
What would be the upside, if any, to this crisis?
I am optimistic and positive by nature but in this situation, I don’t see any upside except maybe one: the revolution has revealed so many talents! It has proved that we’ve moved from an era of communication dictatorship to an era of participative communication democracy, where each citizen becomes a transmitter, constantly exchanging with thousands of other compatriots on social media.
Each citizen has turned into a copywriter, graphic designer, tagger, musician, singer photographer, filmmaker, writer, blogger… thus becoming a creator of images and messages.
Creativity has become everyone’s business; the situation on the ground has become a source of inspiration and an inexhaustible reservoir of ideas. The amount of content created, ranging from amateur to professional work, is massive. Anonymous people seeking neither recognition nor glory wanted to express, in their own way, their state of mind at the moment.
What outcome do you foresee, if possible, for the industry?
Every crisis has an end. Look at what’s happening in Greece or Cyprus. Lebanon will prevail, as usual; it might take some time for the country to bounce back but there’s always hope. Lebanon is known to be a resilient country and the Lebanese to be creative and able to adapt to any situation. This is one of the most difficult periods the country has ever gone through. Things will never be the same, especially for the media industry that lost many players. More than ever, industry players should unite to position Lebanon as the creative, digital and tech cluster of the region, because Beirut is home to the talent that can best adapt to different cultural backgrounds. This will not only boost employment and foreign investments but will have a major impact on Lebanon’s economic recovery.",<urn:uuid:0bf23124-5810-4d1f-b074-720801c4a101>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://communicateonline.me/category/industry-insights/post-details/revolution-devolution,2024-02-20T22:26:38Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9652816653251648,1534,1.662446141242981,2

i have a requirement wherein the url https://xyz.com:9999 will be accessed over the internet.
Now once the NATing is done by the firewall, the traffic will be passed to virtual server (184.108.40.206:443) with client and server ssl profiles applied. Now the question is do i need to apply the pool with server:port (10.10.10.10:9999) under the resource tab of the VS?

I am confused here. any help will be appreciated .
Well, this is up to you.
Per my experience, some customers prefer to offload the SSL decryption task to the F5 unit, so that they don't have to perform additional decriptyon on the backend server farm, saving resources. This is usually also allows more agile administration, because you'll only need to renew the certificates on one appliance (BIG-IP) instead of every server.
Other customers prefer to perform SSL encryption in the backend as well because they prioritize information security across the whole network.You might want to discuss this with your engineering team, and if your servers require the SSL handshake to be performed, you'll need a serverSSL profile.",<urn:uuid:9af7c1b4-b11f-4725-91fa-98a042da9c7e>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://community.f5.com/discussions/technicalforum/virtual-server-config/307372,2024-02-20T22:29:42Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9011831283569336,264,1.746861457824707,2

"This is great, and it worked fine on my clients...however, it does require user interaction. Something I'd rather avoid.
Considering the way Logmein is going, automatic update and install for the LMI client really should be a feature, or at least a job that can be done without user interaction.
Am I missing something?
Ok, I went back and checked a bunch of clients where I was NOT logged in with an active profile through Logmein (unlike the tests) after running the job, and it seems to have worked. I didn't audit the entire network, but I'll say, THANKS for the script. I think this will do EXACTLY what I wanted!
Lol. It really shouldn't be that tough to do the uninstall, though I confess I haven't tried it. Basically, you would write a batch file to do the unistall. I would probably try an msiexec unistall command or maybe wmic. The trick I think would jut be to use One2Many to write this as a .com file and then use the start command to kick it off like the upgrade script previously discussed in this thread.
I was thinking msiexec unistall command too, but can't find the registry string.
I tried a bat file like this:
cd ""C:\Program Files (x86)\LogMeIn\x64\""
It removes it from your LMI Central account, and on the PC it does not auto run, but the installer is still resident in ""Programs and Features"" and the LogMeIn service still runs.
Looks like wmic is the way to go.
bat file looks like this:
wmic product where name='LogMeIn' call uninstall
Setup the task as ""Run a batch file or executable"" and no Optional parameters needed.
Make the plan and then run it with an account with admin privileges.
Of course it will look like the plan never completes since LogMeIn will not return a ""completed"" command, since it will then be uninstalled. However, if you check your computer list, it will be gone.
We don't have a local or virtual domain. Our users are all local admins.

"Hey Meraki Community,
I have a feeling there is a simple explanation here but want to ask the gurus. Customer asks me what the 293 hidden SSIDs are showing up under the Rogue. I checked and indeed Meraki states these are recently seen on the LAN. However none of the MAC addresses show up in the Meraki client list.
I am calling Meraki support and doing a packet capture now to try and figure out what these are.
Any have any idea? I checked other customers and it seems this is somewhat common, and even though we have it set to block rogue SSIDs these are showing up uncontained. Feels like they are mobile phones just doing stuff they probably always do but we never know.
@IT_Magician : A “hidden SSID” on the Air Marshal page is an SSID name that is not included in the beacons and probe responses for a particular BSSID. These can usually be ignored during common network operation, and are unlikely to result in noticeable RF interference. Administrators may specify the same allow list, contain, alert, uncontained rules for BSSIDs contributing to the hidden SSID's seen by selecting the Hidden row and selecting the Broadcast MAC to apply the rule to.
@Inderdeep thank you for the response. What I am struggling to wrap my head around is, why are these showing up under the ROGUE SSID section with the reason ""Rogue because recently seen on the LAN""? This reads that 294 devices on our LAN are broadcasting hidden SSIDs.
Why not just move all of these SSIDs under the ""Other SSIDs""? That is my specific question here, is this a security threat, and if it isn't a security threat, why does Meraki state these are rogue SSIDs because they were recently seen on the LAN?
I appreciate your response, but that isn't the direction we are trying to go. I am on with Meraki support but they are also unsure at the moment.
The question is, Meraki is saying these 293 MAC addresses are rogue because they were recently seen on LAN. But those clients are not on the client list. My gut says this isn't a security issue but I am not going back to my client with a feeling, I want to give them some facts.
I have rarely seen this issue occur because one Meraki AP sees another Meraki AP as a rogue. Rarely. When it has happened, rebooting all the APs at the same time has resolved it.
According to the documentation, it seems to be ""seen on LAN"" when the client has a wired connection and SSID broadcasting together.

"Hi, I am new here,
I would like to know how to do do a console app using openfl. I read that I need to override the create method in my application class.
So could anyone show an “Hello World” example of how to do this?
This is possible – we use it for the OpenFL and Lime command-line tools.
The easiest example I know of are the OpenFL SWF processing tools.
First you need an HXML file, such as this one:
Instead of -cp ..
you will want -lib openfl
The next thing is a Haxe class for your tools. There are two main components to this, the standard static function main
entry point, but also the __init__
function if you need any of the Lime native binaries (which you will need if you do BitmapData
Lime has the lime.tools.helpers
package, which has a lot of helpers we use in the command-line tools for Lime and OpenFL for running processes, creating directories, copying files and other useful utility functions.

"Hi, Is there any free Store Theme that doesn’t have the “View Full Details” button on the home page, so that I will be able to display all of my product description immediately when customers enter the store. And without pressing the “View Full Details” button.
I don't think there's a free theme that does that by default. Actually showing a ""View Full Details"" is a requirement from Shopify for all themes to shows the ""View Full details"" button that points to the actual product page. You will need to implement it yourself if you wish to have full products on the home page.
Hi @DanielSon ,
As mentioned by others in the thread, to achieve this you will need to customize theme code. While this is not official tutorial I found some suggestions on other thread regarding this topic, so you can have a look here. Keep in mind before you customize a theme, it's a good idea to make a backup copy so that you can discard your changes and start again if you need to.
Otherwise, you can look into options of adjusting Featured Product section by adding a new block which would be a Text block. The View full details link would still show, but it allows you to share the most important product details and description that you would like your customers to see when they first land on your homepage.
Featured product section by default doesn’t show all details to avoid cluttering the homepage. For that reason, I would suggest using Text block to share most important bits about your product in order to interest the customer then, allow them to read more details on the actual product page.
Let me know if that helps.",<urn:uuid:29fc09e0-6809-4be5-9453-c63c237e620b>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://community.shopify.com/c/shopify-discussions/online-store/m-p/2252208/highlight/true,2024-02-20T23:49:49Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.931654691696167,344,0.884648323059082,1
"I’ve owned a first generation My Cloud (single disk) for years and it has been plugged into my router with a fixed IP of 192.168.1.2 without many issues for all that time.
We had a power cut last night.
Before the power cut the NAS was accessible, afterwards it is not. The power came back on and the front LED on the device remains a solid white - it never goes blue.
I believe that this means the device has begun its startup - but it never changes. I have left it overnight and it remains a solid white this morning.
The device does not appear in the router’s list of connected devices.
The LAN port on the back of the My Cloud only has a single flashing green LED indicating activity. The other LED is not on - I believe that indicates no link has been established.
This morning I have also tried a power cycle of the device without having any LAN cable plugged in. I wanted to check if the LED eventually changed to blinking amber - which should indicate a network cable is not plugged in - but it doesn’t. Nor is there a solid red light, indicating a fault, either.
The My Cloud front LED remains a solid white all the time.
The green LED on the LAN port indicating an established link is not lit at any time except for about 8 seconds or so after power cable is inserted, then it goes off and only the activity LED flashes. I have tried a different port at the router side, and a switch.
I have tried to press the recessed reset switch for 5 seconds - nothing appeared to happen.
Can anyone recommend next steps? My objective would be to have access to the data.
I have just attempted the 40-second reset… removing power, holding the recessed button down for 40 seconds while power is restored. Still a solid white light and no indication that anything is going on.
Check the network router or gateway administration page to see if it indicates the My Cloud obtaining an IP address.
If the network router/gateway indicates the My Cloud is connected to the local network try accessing the My Cloud Dashboard.
Single-Bay My Cloud OS 3 Dashboard Access
It is also possible the My Cloud is scanning and fixing drive issues or indexing the drive after being powered on that may result in the My Cloud not showing a front blue LED. Sometimes that drive check/index could take a considerable amount of time (hours to a day depending on # of files and drive capacity).
Thanks. Yeah, I’ve already confirmed there’s no IP address being assigned to it - my suspicion has been all along that, somehow, the network interface got fried.
The single flashing LED on the LAN port was the biggest clue. I don’t know that for sure, but no 4 second or 40 second reset seems to do anything in that regard.
I’ve moved beyond this stage in the last hour… I’ve ordered a 2-bay QNAP from Amazon and some disks - it’s time to retire this poor WD darling, I don’t mind - she’s served me very well for years, but I think the best strategy going forward is some kind of mirrored setup with easily removable disks.
But first - can I access the data on this disk?
Well, I’ve broken the disk out of its WD casing… and plugged it into a Windows 7 PC via a UGREEN USB IDE/SATA gadget… it could have been hit-or-miss.
But the drive, when given power, starts and Windows has shown up drive letters of D:, E:, F:, G:, H: and I: - they are all an unrecognised file system - no surprise there.
Next steps… as I don’t have Linux… will be to grab some utility to allow Windows to ‘see’ the data, yes?
If you have any advice, I’ll be grateful.
I saw someone else comment that the disk inside one of these isn’t a WD Red - but mine definitely is.
Using Paragon’s Linux File Systems for Windows trial software… managed to mount L: and see a folder called shares which seems to contain all my data. Copying over now…
For future knowledge you could have created a Linux boot disc or boot flash drive to boot the computer with to access the extracted My Cloud Hard Drive. Most people found WD Red’s within their older single bay My Clouds.
Example of how to create a bootable Linux distro on a DVD or USB flash drive:
Here is the User Manual. You need to look at chapter two LEDs. Did you have it set up for use on your home network only?
I’ve kinda moved on, now… it was definitely never getting an IP address, no matter what I did. The case is in bits on the floor… the disk has been removed and plugged into a USB gizmo and I’ve moved the data to two USB disks in preparation for when my QNAP basic model arrives. I feel OK, now, as I have no NAS, but I do have the data across physical devices. I’ve depended on the My Cloud doing its thing for too long - time to bite the bullet and try and do things more properly from now on.",<urn:uuid:1fdd6f49-2df9-4fca-8620-24e53e24c8d3>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://community.wd.com/t/my-cloud-solid-white-led/288664,2024-02-20T21:42:37Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9399350881576538,1114,0.6631384491920471,1

"“Ireland’s Broadsheet: New ‘Shallow Hype’ on the George Gibney Story,” July 15, https://concussioninc.net/?p=14541
by Irvin Muchnick
Last week we looked at the latest iteration of the now two-year-old contorted defense, by Swimming World editor Craig Lord, of the person and entity most credibly suspected of having engineered the 1995 Colorado coaching job of disgraced Irish Olympic coach George Gibney. That would be John Leonard and the American Swimming Coaches Association (ASCA), of which the elderly Leonard is the former boss.
As Charles R. Breyer, a senior federal judge who is the brother of Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, put it in 2016, ASCA is accused of having “greased the wheels for Gibney’s relocation.” The suspicion flows most powerfully from a coaching job offer letter in Gibney’s immigration file, as revealed in my Freedom of Information Act lawsuit before Judge Breyer against the Department of Homeland Security.
Since the letter was released by the government in almost completely redacted form, we don’t yet know who sent it and why. What we do know, however, is that trouble-shooting coaches’ visas and placing them in jobs abroad has long been ASCA’s stock-in-trade.
We also know that Leonard brazenly proclaimed to me in 2012 that ASCA has “no investigatory powers, funds, or responsibility…. We do not have an organization that deals directly with children, nor is that part of our purpose in any way, shape, or form, according to our formative documents from 1958 and thereafter.”
Really? A trade group of swimming coaches has “no responsibility” for dealings “with children”? Not in “any way, shape, or form”?
Finally, we know that Gibney’s former assistant coach in Ireland, Peter Banks, has bounced back and forth from high positions in both Irish and American swimming, and was one of Leonard’s top aides at ASCA during the period of Gibney’s passage here on a mysterious diversity lottery visa.
None of the foregoing got addressed in 2018 by Craig Lord, a former British newspaper journalist, when he wrote, on his soon-to-be-shuttered website SwimVortex, that Leonard had shown him documents exonerating ASCA in the Gibney affair. Lord refused to publish the alleged documents in his possession, or to quote and contextualize them.
Gibney’s tenure with USA Swimming’s North Jeffco club in Arvada, Colorado, ended disastrously almost as soon as it began in 1995 — marking the apparent finale of a coaching career dotted by dozens of cases of sexual abuse on two continents. Might it be that it was only at that point that Leonard and ASCA decided they no longer wished to continue enabling Gibney?
In his new article last week, Lord, who joined Swimming World after closing SwimVortex, added a non sequitur doubling down on his weirdly self-conclusory Leonard apologia.
“In the course of our own research,” Lord wrote at the end of a piece almost entirely devoted to something else, “Swimming World has had sight of letters in which the American Swimming Coaches Association alerts potential employers to Gibney’s past, as well as other exchanges in which Gibney complains, through a lawyer, to ASCA that he is being prevented from gaining work by ASCA’s interventions.”
Once again, Lord is playing the card “I have in my hands documents …” — yet not disclosing the actual contents of this purported reverse smoking gun.
The reference to ASCA came at the end of last week’s Swimming World piece piling onto hype published a few days earlier, in the Irish Times, of an upcoming podcast documentary series on Gibney from BBC Sounds.
Just to be clear once again, I do not know if the podcast, Where Is George Gibney?, will have anything substantially new. But regardless of whether this Anglo-Irish production has anything substantially new, I recognize that the mere existence of contemporary Gibney coverage at major media platforms, even if incomplete and inadequate from my perspective, could help push over the top the current U.S. federal government investigation of Gibney’s Catch-22 resident alien status. (Gibney was denied naturalized citizenship in 2010 after failing to disclose on his application that he had been indicted in Ireland in 1993 on 27 counts of unlawful carnal knowledge of minors. But this material lie on his citizenship application was not enough to cause his removal from the country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a letter to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, because Gibney was never “convicted of a crime.”)
The current probe has been reported by Concussion Inc. as being under the purview of Jane Khodarkovsky, human trafficking finance specialist at the Department of Justice’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS). The MLARS investigation, in turn, is related to the work of a grand jury, under the direction of the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, which is determining whether there are grounds for criminal charges against USA Swimming and its leadership for decades of insurance fraud, asset hiding, and abuse cover-ups.
The grand jury was reported last fall by the Wall Street Journal and other American newspapers. But they have not joined this reporter in noting a connection to Gibney. To the American audience, he remains “George who?”
Dr. Gary O’Toole, the leading Irish swimmer of the period who took it upon himself to blow the whistle on Gibney starting in 1991, is the focus of the new Irish Times and Swimming World articles. I was honored to spend time with O’Toole during my visit to Dublin last summer. I take no exception, on its own terms, to the victory lap given O’Toole by Times sports columnist Johnny Watterson. I also salute Watterson, along with another Irish journalist, Justine McCarthy (now with London’s Sunday Times), for providing the seminal public oxygen for the scandals of Gibney and the country’s other national swim program bad actors (several of whom landed in prison — though Gibney himself did not).
All I’m pointing out is that a rehash of O’Toole’s brave efforts to take down Gibney a quarter of a century ago is not the story in 2020. Not while the evil coach remains on the loose, and as American authorities close in on decisions about what to do next in response to a two-continent campaign to bring him to justice.
One output for the feds could be prosecution of Gibney for his one known instance of youth sex crime in America: his 1991 rape and impregnation of a 17-year-old swimmer from his Irish team of the time, the Trojans, out of Newpark Comprehensive School in Blackrock, County Dublin, during a training trip in Tampa, Florida. Another output could be Gibney’s extradition back to Ireland to revisit or expand on his original 27-count indictment; that indictment got dropped in 1994, thanks to a controversial and nepotistic procedural ruling by the Irish Supreme Court.
Extradition would involve coordination with Ireland’s director of public prosecutions (DPP). In 2015 the DPP began its latest of several reviews of Gibney matters over the years. This one was at the behest of now-retired Irish legislator Maureen O’Sullivan. In 2017, on the heels of my appellate settlement with the government of the FOIA case in the U.S., Ireland’s then deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Simon Coveney, told O’Sullivan on the floor of the Dáil Éireann that the government would move responsibly on new information.
When it comes to the Irish news media today, they are just worn out and weak — and hence behind the curve on Gibney. Swimming World and Craig Lord, by contrast, are corrupt.
Earlier in July, Swimming World had published another article under the headline “Mark Schubert and John Leonard Issue Denials Over Robert Allard Abuse-Related Accusations.” See https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/mark-schubert-and-john-leonard-issue-denials-over-allard-abuse-related-accusations/. Oddly, the piece had no byline. But Lord’s linguistic fingerprints are evident in British-English usage: for example, the sentence stating that Schubert “is minded” to file a defamation lawsuit against Allard.
Bob Allard is the leading American lawyer representing plaintiffs in lawsuits alleging abuse by USA Swimming coaches, as well as negligence or cover-up by the organization itself. In March, Allard and his client Ariana Kukors settled out of court her sensational and 100 percent truthful claim that she had been groomed and abused for years, starting when she was underage, by her youth coach, Sean Hutchison.
Allard’s California law firm, Corsiglia McMahon & Allard, recently published “An Open Letter to USA Swimming and its CEO Tim Hinchey.” See https://childmolestationattorneys.com/open-letter-tim-hinchey/. Allard demanded therein that Hinchey “fix the root cause of the sexual abuse epidemic which continues to afflict the sport of swimming. Having been deeply involved in the handling of sex abuse claims against USA Swimming for more than a decade, it is clear to us that there remains a deeply embedded culture within your organization which condones the criminal sexual behavior of coaches towards its underage athletes.”
As it happens, Allard’s laundry list of allegations against Leonard involves things other than ASCA’s suspected support of Gibney. But the Irish coach does get name-checked in reference to Schubert, the national coach from 2006 until his firing in 2010. “When Schubert was in a position to effect positive change within USA Swimming,” the open letter states, “he remained silent and took no action against the following coaches known by him to be predators: George Gibney, Scott MacFarland, Daniel Adam Dusenbury, Will Colebank, Murray Stephens, Richard Quick, Paul Bergen, Andy King and Mitch Ivey.”
In the Swimming World story, Schubert “denied even knowing Irish coach George Gibney, accused of abuse by various swimmers back home, and didn’t think he had even ever met him.”
But the pertinent question isn’t whether Schubert ever met Gibney. Schubert settled a wrongful termination suit by his former assistant, Dia Rianda. She was dismissed for demanding action against a coach Schubert was protecting, Bill Jewell, who later would be suspended by USA Swimming for predatory behavior.
Rianda has told me and many others that in hours of Schubert’s confiding in her, following his bitter resignation as national team director, he talked at length about the way the swimming establishment circled the wagons around Gibney. This was subsequent to a 2010 flare-up of Gibney publicity in Florida, but years before I began reporting on Gibney in 2015.
With John Leonard, the unsigned author of Swimming World‘s July 3 story exploited the familiar rhetorical card trick of the ASCA boss and his apologists when it comes to addressing known incidents involving famous coaches, and the failure to prosecute or administratively discipline them. That trick is to make the failure itself the circular and definitive answer to the allegations — when the point of those exposing abuse is that the allegations were truthful and should have resulted in prosecution or bans.
Leaning into the criminal standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” frustrates critics who seek to change abuse culture. And it is the wrong standard for certifying authority figures in youth-serving activities. Unless, that is, you buy into the mentality that swimming coaches have no responsibility for dealings with children, in any way, shape, or form.
Murray Stephens, founder of the North Baltimore Aquatic Club — later the home of Michael Phelps — was secretly pushed off pool decks following 2012 reports of his abuses. But in Leonard-speak, as ventriloquized by Lord, the takeaway is: “I am not aware of anything banning Murray anywhere. He is not on the banned list. I am not, nor have I ever been, aware of any accusations of Murray in this regard.”

"Last week, a troupe of young, inquisitive scientists walked across the street to campus from Jefferson Middle School. These young students were on hand for an after-school camp, Cyclones Science Investigations, hosted by Columbia College. For five days, about 20 students participated in hands-on activities with Columbia College science, nursing, forensic science and mathematics faculty.
Tracy Worthington, a social studies teacher at Jefferson Middle School, had the idea for the camp. Worthington, who said the middle school has identified a need to improve science literacy among its students, approached Teresa VanDover about developing an after-school program with Columbia College science faculty. VanDover, an associate professor of education at Columbia College and chair of the college’s Partners in Education committee, was excited about the camp.
“I am enthusiastic about this work because it provides hands-on, authentic learning for our Middle School Students, and increases the opportunities for Columbia College to engage with the broader educational community,” said VanDover.
Each day of the week brought new activities to introduce the middle schoolers to various fields of science jobs in those fields. Monday and Tuesday, Criminal Justice instructor Mark Himmel showed students the technologies used to detect fingerprints, calculate bullet trajectories, identify footprints and spot clues not visible to the naked eye.
Wednesday brought an exercise in applied physics and math with”bungie-jumping Barbies,” as Professor of Mathematics, Dr. Ann Schlemper, taught students to measure the distance a Barbie doll falls when connected to a chain of rubber bands. The students used their measurements to create scatter plots and linear regressions. Columbia College students even got in on the action, as Dr. Curtis Mason, assistant professor of Education, brought some of his students to assist with the activity and practice their teaching skills.
Dr. Joyce Gentry, associate professor of Nursing, took the lead on Thursday by showing the students how to check each other’s blood pressure, reflexes and pupillary responses. They also had the opportunity to interact with Simon the SimMan, the nursing lab’s interactive patient simulator.
To wrap up the week, Dr. Chris Babayco, assistant professor of chemistry, wowed students by demonstrating how different elements emit different colors when burned. They also made “elephant’s toothpaste,” a catalyzed reaction of household ingredients that creates a fast-expanding foam.
To participate in the camp, interested middle schoolers had to write an essay about why they wanted to attend, as well as acquire a teacher recommendation. Worthington believes the camp showed great success in its pilot year.
“Students [who hadn’t applied to the program] keep coming to me wanting to get in,” Worthington said during the week. And of those who did attend, “They’ve been really engaged and asked a lot of good questions about science in the real world.”

"SOLAR ENERGY THAT IS SMART, MOBILE AND HIGHLY FLEXIBLE
In recent years, Power-Blox as a social entrepreneur has successfully implemented electrification projects in Vanuatu, Laos, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Uganda, and in more than 20 other countries in Sub Sahara Africa, South es Asia, and the Pacific region. Power-Blox has partnered successfully with companies from the private sector as well as with NGOs, the German GIZ, and UN organizations to develop a holistic ecosystem of solutions that “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”.
“Together with our partners we have developed and tested several business models from kilowatt-based tariffs to lease-to-own models,” says Alessandro Medici, CTO, and founder of Power-Blox. To run those models in extremely remote spots, further products and services have followed, like a smart electricity metering solution, a cloud-based energy sales platform, and gateways that enable remote monitoring, over-the-air updates as well as predictive maintenance solutions based on the data provided. “Our holistic solution combined with connectivity allows us to serve even the most remote places across the globe with reliable and resilient renewable electricity.” says Alessandro Medici and adds: “Especially during the COVID-Lockdowns when going on site was impossible, our connectivity solutions were essential to operate and maintain our systems.
Power-Blox was facing three major challenges:
- How to provide globally available energy management on thousands of single and clustered Power-Blox units while having to negotiate with hundreds of Mobile Network Operators and dozens of price plans?
- How to provide a globally stable and 24/7/365 available energy management, monitoring, and trading platform?
- Security? Data coming from and going to a Power-Blox have to be handled confidentially. Power-Blox wants to ensure its client's best possible privacy.
Each PBX cluster consists of one to nine PBX devices, controlled by an embedded Linux gateway, responsible for the device and cloud communication. All actors and sensors within a PBX exchange their data with the gateway via a PBX internal Bluetooth transceiver. The gateway connects to a locally available WiFi network and in case of WiFi unavailability automatically switches to the globally accessible mobile network provided by ConnectedYou.
ConnectedYou acts as a single point of contact for the best global and local mobile network operators. Its unique IoT service platform consolidates the best services and solutions of these MNO partners.
“ConnectedYou offers the best possible prices paired with an excellent and reliable service, seamless connectivity around the globe, today and in the future with the possibility to change Mobile-Network-Providers anytime, flexibly over the air (OTA)” said Markus Parzefall, Head of R&D at Power-Blox
WHAT KIND OF DATA IS TRANSMITTED
Two kinds of data are transmitted:
- In the beginning, the data volume will concentrate on small data in order to control and monitor the PBX devices in a bi-directional way.
- “In the future, we can imagine providing even Internet access over the same gateway infrastructure,” said Markus Parzefall.
FIRST DEPLOYMENTS -
- Power supply for telephone communication to 200 – 300 Mountain huts for Swisscom in Switzerland
- Village electrification projects in Vanuatu, Laos, Mozambique, Mali, Uganda, Rwanda, and Tanzania
- Electrification of 42 remote health centers in Mozambique
- Special equipment for disaster relief agencies such as the DEZA, Médecins sans frontières (doctors without borders), and the red cross
- Electrification projects in refugee settlements for UNDP / UNHCR and the International Lifeline Fund, with a focus on the productive use of energy applications
- Various projects within the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals
WHY CONNECTEDYOU WAS CHOSEN
- One single partner for all global data communication (M2M)
- Cost-efficient scale-up to larger data volumes
- Real-time SIM card management
- Secure communication with devices
- Efficient data visualization
In order to fulfill the project goals in a short time and professional way, it is very important for Power-Blox to have a partner like ConnectedYou, who provides flexible and secure connectivity and data management on a global scale.
Thanks to ConnectedYou, Power-Blox is able to create a great business package for their partners and clients on a global scale, and react fast and professionally to their communication in a rapidly growing IoT B2B market.
Especially the advanced real-time SIM card management tools by ConnectedYou make it very practical for Power-Blox to manage devices and their data consumption in real time around the globe.
In the future, Power-Blox plans to embed the SIM modules into their PBX-Gateways. This will greatly reduce the SIM logistic because there will be no physical SIM handling. All SIM services will be managed over the air, directly and 100% flexible.
Power-Blox is an award-winning Swiss company that develops, produces, and distributes intelligent swarm electrification solutions. It has developed a ground-breaking, potentially disruptive technology, which supported by an algorithm, allows the setup of a swarm grid with a decentralized architecture and no centralized control (i.e. master/slave principle). This enables automated and decentralized power regulation and storage within the grid. We call it “the internet of energy” as it follows the principles of the Arpanet. The system is self-learning and self-regulating; it regulates power production, consumption, and distribution in the grid intelligently and autonomously. Moreover, it allows to easily combine different energy sources and battery systems, without the need for configuration. Power-Blox has already won several awards (Intersolar Smarter E Award 2019, Axpo Energy Award 2014, UN National Energy Globe Award of Tanzania 2015). The nearly endless scalability of the Power-Blox system represents a breakthrough in energy technology. It allows scalable growth based on increasing energy demands, without the need of modifying/replacing existing installations. Power-Blox was founded in July 2015 by Alessandro Medici and Armand Martin. It is a privately held company headquartered in Frick, Switzerland.",<urn:uuid:c751f3bd-9e9c-41b8-b482-e4eacf3030db>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://connectedyou.io/blogs/interesting-cases/powerblox-solar-energy-case-study,2024-02-20T22:36:22Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9120765328407288,1333,1.4490855932235718,1
"Žalgiris Arena Water Sports Centre
Kaunas City Municipality and Conres have signed a contract for the construction of a water sports centre worth €25.8 million. In the area next to Žalgiris Arena a building featuring exceptional architecture will emerge that will house not only an Olympic-size pool with 500 grandstands seats but also a spa area and a gym.
Kaunas City Municipality
18.4 thousand m²
09/2020 - 05/2022
The experience of the contractor is unsurpassed
Five companies competed for the opportunity to build this extraordinary object on Nemunas River Island. The general contractor and construction company Conresta, which has extensive experience in implementing ambitious projects, won the competition.
Among the most prominent projects implemented by the company are the automated Continental plant, the modern logistics centre for Lietuvos Paštas, the restoration of the historic Pacai Palace and the five-star Pacai Hotel, as well as the Palanga City Swimming Pool with a Wellness Centre and Palanga Concert Hall.
“The opportunity to build a swimming pool featuring exceptional architecture represents a positive evaluation of our experience. The preparation for work has been intense. However, with our many years of experience and the competencies of our employees, we will ensure the smooth implementation of the project. Of course, we are certain to uncover some interesting challenges but we are ready for them,” said Lukas Laukaitis, Director of Conresta.
The construction of the new water sports and entertainment centre is planned to start in a few months, after the preparation of a detailed work project is completed. Under the contract, the new complex will be built within just 18 months. The total area of the A+ Energy Class single-storey building with a mezzanine will reach 18.4 thousand sq. metres.
It will enhance the relief of Nemunas River Island
The multifunctional water sports centre will be located next to Žalgiris Arena, on the western side. A passage will connect these spaces, extending from the main entrance to the arena.
The new building will have a 50 m 10-lane pool with a 500-seat grandstand for spectators. It will be equipped to host international competitions and national championships. The second, smaller pool will serve as a site for children’s swimming lessons. The swimming pool and the related infrastructure will meet the requirements of the International Swimming Federation (FINA).
There will also be a spa area for 300 people with three different temperature-controlled sauna complexes, entertainment pools for children and adults, massage tubs, relaxation rooms and a café. In addition, the water sports centre will have a gym for 200 people.

My life in Manhattan can be very stressful as I am a photographer and work every single day shooting actors, chefs, corporate portraits, celebrities and musicians. When I met Agni, we immediately sparked and I felt an instant connection with her. We would meet on the beach alone and do sessions together consisting of breath work and meditation. I felt my whole body and mind relax and reconnect with my higher self. I would highly recommend her to anyone seeking relief from the stress we all know so well. I run three businesses single-handedly. The time that I give to myself with Agni is a gift and I am forever grateful for her!”

Because of my work traveling a lot and doing business, I usually get stressed. The breathing sessions I had with Agni helped me with my meditation and I have been practicing this for some time. Agni definitely knows what she’s doing.

I met Agni for the first time back in March when I was vacationing in Hawaii. We had the best meditative practice on the beach… this Prana breathing made me feel rejuvenated, calm and connected.

"Combilift has announced the launch of the new Aisle Master-OP (AME-OP), a stand-on electric powered model that combines the advantages of a narrow aisle articulated forklift and an order picker for versatile operation in warehousing applications.
The company, which made the official launch in a virtual press conference this month, said the development of the model was influenced by customer feedback, as well as the recent growth of e-commerce.
Combilift CEO Martin McVicar said: “Customers already using the Aisle Master for space saving, storage and efficiency in their warehouse asked if we could redevelop the Aisle Master to meet their ever-growing demand for order picking customised orders.”
Combilift said the Aisle Master-OP was created based on research and development carried out in 2019 and 2020. The main feature of the unit is the step-through operator compartment which has design copyright protection (European Design Registration No. 002676809-0001) across multiple markets worldwide.
Describing the new model, Combilift’s statement added: “The low floor height of just 280mm enables convenient, single step access from both sides of the truck which speeds up order picking compared to the operator having to get on and off from a seated position. The AME-OP truck has all the key advantages of the conventional Aisle Master – indoor/outdoor, for loading/offloading and for stock replenishment at other times during shifts when order picking is complete.”
The Aisle Master-OP is available in a number of variants, with lift capacities from 1,500kg to 2,500kg, lift heights up to 12.1m and can operate in aisles as narrow as 1650mm. It features a patented chain steering system, which allows the truck to articulate more than 205°, with an inline drive motor and front drive axle assembly, all of which enable narrower aisle operation.
The multifunctional programmable joystick control lever in the operator compartment, which includes controls for the hydraulics and traction, is adjustable to enable comfortable and ergonomic working conditions for operators of all sizes. The Operator Presence Detection floor pad engages the parking brake automatically when the operator steps off the truck to carry out order picking.
McVicar added: “Before we officially launch any new model, Combilift carry out extensive field testing on customer’s sites. This was the case with the Aisle Master-OP.”
Combilift said the AME-OP is now a production model within its portfolio, with units currently in build for customers in the USA and New Zealand – one of which is Sorted Logistics based in Christchurch New Zealand, a third-party logistics provider and freight forwarder who will be receiving eight AME-OP units shortly.
“This is a major innovation in the warehousing sector and the versatility to use the one Aisle Master for multiple applications – narrow aisle operation, truck to rack handling, bulk picking and item order picking – will result in strong demand for this new product in our home and export markets around the world,” McVicar said.",<urn:uuid:ebcb6a87-9a8d-440a-b01e-50ddabde7b6f>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://constructionmachinerymenews.com/46062/combilift-launches-aisle-master-op-for-warehousing-applications/,2024-02-20T21:52:29Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9426201581954956,654,1.192674994468689,1

"Samsung C27F398 Review - Quick Verdict
The Samsung C27F398 is a 27″ curved monitor that is perfect for those who are looking for an immersive viewing experience. The colors are vibrant and the display is perfect for media consumption and gaming. Though a little tweaking is needed, image quality is neat. If you’re going for curved monitors that has the perfect balance of price and features, this Samsung display could be the one for you.
Curved monitors are pretty cool and bring some sophistication to your room. In this Samsung C27F398 review, we are going to analyze one such curved monitor that comes with an affordable price tag.
With its full HD resolution, it is not the pixel beast, but it sure brings in a good number of features to make an enticing final product. If you’re looking for a curved screen at a price point that’s inexpensive, then this monitor should have your interest. Let’s find out if this display is worth the price.
Even though the Samsung C27F398 is a budget monitor, Samsung has made it a point to not cheap out when it comes to the design of this display.
In fact, the monitor carries the same design language you can see in the higher-end models. It comes with a glossy black front and a matte black back which gives it a premium look.
You can find bezels surrounding the panel, but they’re not that big. Since the entire setup is black, you wouldn’t notice the bezels that much.
But this is a cheap monitor, and that shows in the build quality. There is a lot of plastic in the monitor that makes it look and feel a bit cheap. Some might even think of this monitor as fragile.
It does stand firm when placed on the table, but all it takes to disturb that serenity is a little push. Then you take a trip to wobble town.
The glossy finish you find in the Samsung C27F398 is a smudge magnet. Make a slight adjustment with your hand, and you can see fingerprints all over that glossy surface.
The Y-shaped stand takes a lot of space on your desk. Most of the monitors come with height adjustment, but you’ll not find it here. The only thing you can do here is tilting which, sadly, doesn’t give you all the flexibility you need.
The VESA mount compatibility is another good thing about the Samsung C27F398. If you can follow instruction, then you can mount this thing on your wall with ease.
The Samsung C27F398 curved monitor gives you some connectivity options. The monitor comes with an HDMI and a display port which are much better than having a VGA port or a DVI port.
Having these ports enable you to connect this monitor with the latest desktops and laptops with ease. Just take the cord and plug, no need to meddle with screws and such.
There is also a headphone jack at the back. You can connect one, but the positioning is not that great. Once you connect your headphone, you might want to leave it there to avoid reaching the back of your monitor every single time.
Samsung C27F398 Specs
Before we talk about the performance, let’s take a look at what the Samsung C27F398 offer on paper.
The monitor is a 27″ display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels which puts it in the full HD category. The panel here is a VA one and not IPS.
The display comes with a refresh rate of 60Hz, and a response time of 4ms which is pretty decent. With a contrast ratio of 3000:1, the Samsung C27F398 can go up to a maximum of 250cd/m^2.
The monitor has a curve radius of 1800r which is a bit more aggressive than other models on the market, but it doesn’t go as far to distort the images on the screen.
If you want this display just for the curvature, then this should be a problem. Having this curved screen does make things a lot better and closer for a more immersive experience.
How Does the Display Fare Out of the Box?
Out of the box, the display does a decent job, but there is scope for a lot of improvements.
For one, the screen produces only 97% of the sRGB color gamut with an accuracy of Delta 3.5. This is not that high quality, but it can be improved by tweaking the settings a bit. After tweaking, you get massive improvements which make this display much better.
Gamma is also not right when you first use the display. After careful calibration, you can increase the gamma to the proper levels. This process also reduces the yellowish tint on the screen and makes it more white. Though this is personal preference, you are better off with a screen that is less warm.
Samsung C27F398 Performance
The monitor’s performance is impressive for the price. The monitor can put out a contrast ratio of 3000:1 at maximum brightness. With this contrast ratio, you get deep blacks and bright whites. You can also see improvements in grayscale performance as well.
When you display a full black picture on the screen, it does look a bit brighter on the center. While this can be a minor issue for some, it won’t affect the screen’s performance during gaming or media consumption.
Being a VA panel, you’d expect a viewing angle that is better than that of a TN panel. We can say that the viewing angle is definitely better, but you’d expect more in this case.
The panel uniformity is a concern here as there is a notable deviation from the center to the sides. While this is not as bad as to break the whole viewing experience for you, it can be a pet peeve for some.
The Samsung C27F398 has a response time of 4ms which is not that great. The monitor does come with a 3-stage response time setting which can help reduce any ghosting or smudging. If you’re a fan of action games, then use this feature to improve the quality of your visual output.
The monitor comes with FreeSync compatibility. This is similar to Nvidia’s G-Sync but for AMD graphics cards. The monitor can match the GPU’s frame rate and offer a much better gaming experience that is void of ghosting and other problems.
Samsung C27F398 Review – Bottomline
The Samsung C27F398 27″ curved monitor is what it is. It is an affordable curved monitor that offers a good viewing experience without the bells and whistles.
While it doesn’t get too bright, it does have excellent contrast ratio to back it up. The image quality, with a bit of tweaking, can be excellent which is ideal for gaming and other graphics work.
If you’re okay with the 1080p resolution and the 60Hz refresh rate, then you won’t have a bad time with this curved monitor from Samsung.",<urn:uuid:de4e0038-9011-423d-bee9-e01cabbaa927>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://consumertechcentral.com/samsung-c27f398-review/,2024-02-20T21:59:36Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9412258267402649,1473,0.8709293603897095,1

Supply of clean water and efficient management of waste water are among the most vital urban environmental services. For communities, water related services are also often the biggest energy consumers – underlining the significance of water-energy nexus. It is therefore easy to view waste as a problem to be mitigated, something to be reduced to a tolerable level, and kept out of sight. Another mind-set is possible. Organic waste contains significant quantities of energy embedded in it. The facts that these streams of organic matter are distributed across our communities, trickle down in small streams and have low energy density, have made it difficult to capture that energy anywhere else but in locations with large populations and high population densities. A European project DEMOSOFC showcases a replicable concept by which power generation can be integrated into water services at superb efficiency in small and medium sized facilities, too, making good use of modular nature of fuel cells and fuel flexibility of SOFC technology. The video below presents the concept by an example from Collegno waste water treatment facility of SMAT in Turin region, Italy.

"What is the formal definition of ""savory"" when used in cooking? I hear a lot about things coming in either sweet or savory forms — e.g. crepes — but in context it doesn't seem that savory is the term for all things that are not sweet. Does it have to do with preparation methods? Ingredients? Taste of the final product?

The Noah Munck faux-hawk hair can also be worn as a short and casual hairdo. The young actor is best known for his role as Gibby in iCarly and as a young entrepreneur in charge of lawn care in TruGreen commercials. The hairdo design benefits him in two ways. First, it is a young look without being complicated or messy. In addition, this style helps to offset his very round facial shape.
As with many short styles, this becoming hairdo requires frequent and regular trims. In order to maintain the peak, styling gel will be necessary. Holding product also helps to make the locks shiny. The daily styling time is very short, only about ten minutes once a routine is established.
The actor’s strands are cut short on the sides and back, using a clipper. The edge is neat and blends smoothly into the somewhat longer top hairs. The cut for the crown of his head is layered so that it can be styled into the faux-mohawk design. The cut can also be designed into a more casual style, simply depending upon the way the top strands are arranged.
The style is more appropriate to a younger man. The ability of the design to make a round face look longer and thinner has already bee mentioned. Oval, triangular and heart-shaped face shapes can also take advantage of this style. It is appropriate for medium or fine hair texture.
The Noah Munck faux-mohawk hair look is a good choice for men of this age and facial shape. Since the daily styling work requires only a few minutes, the look is easy to maintain. Styling gel is used to smooth the sides and back of the head, while the top hair is lifted up and drawn into the distinctive spine of the Mohawk.",<urn:uuid:8d166277-49e7-46fe-8d9e-d12a84a7866f>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://coolmenshair.com/noah-munck-faux-hawk-hair/,2024-02-20T22:56:19Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9669584035873413,378,1.0345797538757324,1

No matter which form of play the individuals choose, the primary aims of disc golf are conceptually the same as conventional golf within the sense that players comply with the identical scorekeeping technique. The disc stays in movement while travelling on its edge at a slight angle, and might journey exceedingly far in perfect situations. You’ll be able to call the play-recreation function with no arguments to let it play a single game and return the number of turns it took. I wanted something completely different for a whole lot of reasons, and I’m getting too much out of it as a result of having a group environment when I was in highschool and college golf, it elevated my sport, having players to play with, compete with. That implies that just nine in 10,000, or .09 percent, of highschool senior football players are ultimately drafted by an NFL crew. These embody match play, skins, pace golf and captain’s choice, which in disc golf is known as “doubles” (not to be confused with companion or workforce play). Many gamers use what is referred to as a run-up during their drive. Since most you aren’t trying to study a brand new language, I’ll use R instead. The time period sidearm actually predates the time period forehand, which is seemingly in use right now as a less complicated means to communicate the technique, equating to a tennis forehand.
Because of the potential snap obtainable with this method, one can count on better distance than with a forehand throw. Also on account of the short flip and backspin of this shot, it’s typically used to get out of the woods. Innova Discs price stability as “flip” and “fade”. Zero to 5, where zero has the least fade, and 5 has probably the most fade. The degree to which a disc will fade will depend on its pitch angle and design. The forehand (sidearm) throw is performed by drawing the disc from behind and partially throughout the front of the body: much like a sidearm throw in baseball. The Baseball or Grenade. A flying disc will maintain its spin price even as it loses velocity. Velocity is a vector quantity. Even adults are lined with some great fleece designs that really look nice when worn. Even a quick try discipline will inform you that plenty of with the leading Web primarily based companies are using social networking to their advantage. Lot of upselling of premium products. This is practiced to construct extra forward disc momentum and distance. For a left-handed, backhand throw (LHBH), the disc will naturally fall to the precise.
For a left-handed, forehand throw (LHFH), the disc will naturally fall to the left. Ideally the thrower doesn’t rotate his wrist; the act of following by means of will give the disc its spin. A gentle nudge will knock it off its axis of rotation for a second, but it surely is not going to topple over because spin provides gyroscopic stability. In the identical manner, a flying disc resists rolling (flipping over) as a result of spin adds gyroscopic stability. For example, a disc with a turn of −5 and fade of 0 will fly to the correct (for right handed, backhand throw) nearly all of its flight then curl again minimally left at the end. Both the Guardian and Bloomberg not too long ago reported, for example, that Google co-founder Sergey Brin is building a giant airship in a hangar at a northern California airfield. This studio is at the moment managed from PCR 21 on the second floor of the Sky Studios building.
Sky Store is a service operated by Sky Group within the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Switzerland that gives movies and Tv shows via video streaming or DVD and Blu-ray Disc by mail. Their understanding and mastery can vastly enhance a player’s game, and offer numerous options in maneuvering the disc to the basket with greater efficacy. And in case you have any lingering ache, relaxation can help you heal. Children are welcome to carry cash with them and keep it in their bag, or we are able to hold it for them on the front desk. To perform this throw, the disc is rapidly drawn from across the front of the physique, and launched in the direction of a ahead aimpoint. Using the thumb as the power finger, the disc is drawn from the thigh space rearwards and up from behind the body to over the shoulder, releasing towards a ahead aimpoint. Gripped equally to the sidearm toss however thrown with an overhand movement; the disc orientation is practically perpendicular to the bottom over much of the flight.

"Here are 5 tips for making your business remarkable and getting people talking. I’ll back-up the theory with some practical applications of these ideas for businesses that you don’t typically think of as ‘remarkable’.
1. Do The Unexpected – Surprise, Don’t Shock
Don’t allow your business to be an ‘also-ran’ and fade into the background. Find a way to deliver something above and beyond what people expect. It doesn’t have to be extravagant or strange, just surprising. Your customers should say ‘I really didn’t expect them to do that, but I love it!’
Example: Commercial Cleaner
Commercial cleaners clean offices and premises late at night when employees have gone home. Their work is rarely witnessed or praised by the office workers who benefit. But what if the cleaner was to do something a little different to leave their mark. What if a cleaner left a foiled wrapped chocolate resting on your keyboard so when you get to work the next day there’s a treat waiting – that’s a nice way to start the day, right?
Or each cleaner could be issued with a sticker with their name, photo & message on it – ‘Have an excellent day!’ They could leave a sticker on every desk they clean which reminds the office workers that someone is there at night, working hard for them, and that person has a name. It humanizes an otherwise faceless business.
2. ‘Going The Extra Mile’ = Business As Usual
Treat customers with a level of service that they just don’t expect, and act like it’s normal for you to do this. ‘That’s just the kind of business we are!’
When a customer calls you out to their home to do a job, don’t go empty handed.
Take them a muffin or cupcakes as a treat. You should act as if you’re a guest in their house; guests are courteous and they bring gifts. It only costs you $0.50 a time to do this and you can bet they’ll remember the next time their faucet breaks they should call the guys with the cakes!
3. Be Bold Not Boring
Everything you do is a marketing opportunity and you need to make the most of it. Look at the assets you have from your store front to your branded plastic bags. Do they make people stop and look? Do your customers say ‘hey, great bag, that’s really cool!’
If they don’t, then you’re not doing enough to make your business memorable.
Example: Dry Cleaners
All dry cleaners use the same sort of polythene bags to protect customers’ clothes, and every customer carries this bag down the street in full public view.
Yet every bag from every dry cleaner looks identical – transparent with a logo stuck on it. What a great opportunity to stand out and get noticed. Why not switch colors and go for a glaring bright pink bag, or be bold and get some daring designs printed with people in their underwear (funny & relevant).
4. Work Doesn’t Have To Be Just About Work
You want to make your place of work more than just where you work. It should be a social place that people like to come to and has real character. Customers respond to the genuine, personal approach so get out from behind the counter and show them your fun side.
You want to build up a relationship with your customers so they both trust you and like you.
Why not use your empty store at night for a wine tasting event. Invite your customers in for an evening of fine wines and run it in conjunction with a local wine merchant – they provide the wine and advice, you offer a free & fun evening for your customers. And again, be playful with it – call it ‘Glasses half empty’.
5. Reward Loyalty With REAL Rewards
Rewarding loyalty is an obvious thing to do, but don’t do the typical thing of offering customers more of the same. You want to extend your relationship beyond your store so that customers really remember you and appreciate you.
Example: Dry Cleaner
Create a loyalty scheme which rewards customers for every 10th visit they make to your business. But don’t offer them 1 free clean – that’s so predictable!
Again, team up with a friendly local business, maybe a restaurant or a salon and offer a free lunch or beauty treatment (good lead generation for that business). Then when that customer is enjoying their free lunch or getting pampered they’ll think of you.
Create Positive Experiences NOT Adverts
The more positive experiences you can create for your customers the greater the impact of Social PR on your business. These experiences become stories and these stories get shared which drives new customers to your door, and keeps existing customers coming back. All this and you didn’t have to spend a cent on advertising.",<urn:uuid:43f960e6-8b6d-47fd-9e88-4316d445ee5c>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://coplancreativeconsulting.com/social-media-marketing-2/5-tips-making-business-remarkable/,2024-02-20T23:07:01Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9473868012428284,1057,1.2396976947784424,1

"UAE Corporate Tax For Businesses with Extensive Property Assets
Jun 09, 2023 / UAE Corporate Tax
The government of the United Arab Emirates recently announced the establishment of a maximum net interest rate ceiling for corporation tax, demonstrating the country’s dedication to fostering a favorable business climate. This critical move intends to provide firms functioning in the booming economy of the UAE with more clarity and stability. This essay examines the specifics of this new rule, its effects on businesses, and any possible advantages it may have for the UAE business environment.
The Maximum Net Interest Rate Cap For Corporate Tax
The UAE government’s introduction of a maximum net interest rate cap for corporate tax is essential to increase transparency and promote economic development. This law limits the interest costs that UAE-based companies may deduct from their taxable revenue. This measure’s primary goal is to limit excessive interest deductions and ensure all businesses are subject to a fair and equal tax system.
Benefits for Businesses
1. Improving Tax Planning
A maximum net interest rate cap for corporate tax limit gives firms the ability to manage their taxes in a more organized way. Businesses may strategically use their resources, streamline their financial procedures, and make wise investment choices by establishing explicit limits on interest deductions. This rule promotes proactive tax preparation, giving firms more assurance and efficiency when negotiating the tax environment.
2. Promoting Equity Financing
Equity funding is essential for fostering long-term company success. By encouraging a transition toward equity-based financing structures, the maximum net interest rate cap for corporate tax limit encourages businesses to look for alternate sources of finance. This change not only improves the financial stability of enterprises but also lessens their reliance on debt financing, possibly decreasing total financial risks and boosting resistance to market swings.
3. Fair Tax Procedures
Adopting a maximum net interest rate cap for corporate tax encourages equitable taxation policies across the UAE. This rule assures that all firms, regardless of size or industry, are subject to a fair tax system by prohibiting excessive interest deductions. That creates an appropriate playing field, promotes healthy competition, and cultivates an ethical and open corporate climate.
Resulting Effects on the Business Landscape
Establishing the maximum net interest rate cap for corporate tax is anticipated to affect the business environment in the United Arab Emirates. Here are some essential things to think about:
1. Transparency and compliance with regulations
The new law strongly emphasizes the value of regulatory compliance and openness in corporate practices. Corporations must carefully examine their financial arrangements and comply with the established interest rate limit. By following these rules, companies may show dedication to regulatory compliance, increasing stakeholder confidence and credibility.
2. Enhancing Investor Confidence
Investors are likely to see the maximum net interest rate cap’s adoption as a move in the right direction toward fostering a more secure and open business climate. The UAE has become an even more attractive location for foreign direct investment (FDI) with more transparency and less ambiguity. This action may encourage long-term economic development and draw in a larger spectrum of investors.
3. Economic Sustainability and Diversification
The UAE has been aggressively pursuing economic diversification policies to lessen its dependence on oil earnings. This more extensive perspective is supported by the implementation of the maximum net interest rate cap for corporate tax limit, which encourages companies to look into other financing options and diversify their sources of income. As a result, the UAE economy is better prepared to withstand shocks and adjust to shifting market dynamics over the long run.
The UAE government has shown its dedication to maintaining a beneficial business climate by enacting a maximum net interest rate cap for corporation tax. For companies, this rule offers several benefits, such as improved tax planning, support of equity financing, and promotion of fair taxing procedures. Additionally, it has broad ramifications for the business environment in the UAE, encouraging compliance with regulations, boosting investor confidence, and supporting economic diversification and sustainability.
To maintain compliance and maximize their financial strategy, companies must speak with tax experts and consultants as they adjust to this new regulatory environment. By accepting these changes, businesses may position themselves strategically, contribute to the UAE’s economy’s expansion, and prosper in a setting that emphasizes openness, justice, and long-term success.

"I recently encountered a situation where I needed to render a multi select in a grid. We have a license for Kendo so I figured it was a great opportunity to use their MVC Kendo Grid. What I didn’t know was this type of binding is not included out of the box and must be custom built. I was very surprised by this so I wanted to share my solution and hopefully save other developers the time. Figure 1 shows the multi select inside of a grid that we will be building in this post.
Figure 1: Kendo Multi Select in a MVC Kendo Grid
Setting up the Kendo Grid
First, I want to start off with the models (Figure 2). Each MultiSelectGridModel represents a person, or row in the grid. Each person can have many skills, which is the field that will be represented in the multi select. Skills are represented as a List because the user can select multiple options from the multi select control.
Figure 2: Models
Figure 3: Kendo Instantiation in the CSHTML File (Razor Syntax)
Figure 5: Edited Kendo Grid
Second, we have the Editor Template (Figure 6). This template is just a view that contains the Kendo Multi Select control with the definition of what to bind to. In this case we will be binding to a variable in the ViewData called SkillsList.
Figure 6: Skills Editor Template
Now that we have the view and model set up, we need to write the controller method to handle the get request (Figure 7). First, we will build a List that will contain the options present in the multi select. Next we will add the variable to the ViewData so the editor template will be able to access it during runtime. Lastly, we will construct the model and return it with the view.
Figure 7: MVC Controller Get Action
I’m surprised Kendo UI didn’t come with built-in bindings for these different column types, but they did build out a very flexible platform to create any column type that is desired. The flexibility is proving useful for us as our client has already asked for enhancements on the grid we delivered to them.

"Have you ever wondered about the mysteries of life and what happens to us after we die? The concept of reincarnation has fascinated humanity for centuries, offering a glimpse into the possibility of multiple lives and the continuation of the soul’s journey. In this article, I’ll delve into the intriguing topic of the law of reincarnation, exploring its raw and unfiltered essence. Get ready to embark on a thought-provoking exploration that will challenge your beliefs and expand your understanding of the universe.
The law of reincarnation is a fundamental principle that suggests that our souls are eternal and undergo a cycle of rebirth into different physical bodies. It proposes that we are not limited to a single lifetime, but rather, we have the opportunity to learn, grow, and evolve through multiple incarnations. This concept is rooted in various spiritual and religious traditions, spanning across cultures and civilizations. Join me as we peel back the layers of this ancient wisdom and uncover the raw truth behind the law of reincarnation.
In our quest for knowledge and enlightenment, the law of reincarnation offers a profound perspective on the nature of existence. It challenges us to contemplate the purpose and meaning of our lives, and how our actions in one lifetime may shape our experiences in the next. So, let’s dive deep into the mysteries of the law of reincarnation, embracing its raw and unfiltered essence, as we embark on a journey of self-discovery and spiritual exploration.
The Mysteries of Life and Death
Life and death are two fundamental aspects of our existence that have puzzled humans for centuries. As I delve deeper into the concept of reincarnation, I can’t help but reflect on the profound mysteries surrounding life and death.
1. The Cycle of Birth and Death: The law of reincarnation teaches us that life is not just a single event, but rather a continuous cycle of birth and death. Each life we lead is only a small part of our eternal journey. It raises questions about where we come from, why we are here, and what happens to us after death.
2. Lessons and Growth: Reincarnation challenges us to consider the purpose and meaning of our lives. It suggests that each lifetime is an opportunity for learning, growth, and soul evolution. The experiences we encounter and the choices we make in one lifetime may influence our path in future lives. This idea encourages self-reflection and self-improvement, as we strive to make the most of this precious existence.
3. The Role of Karma: Karma, the law of cause and effect, plays a crucial role in the concept of reincarnation. It proposes that our actions in one life determine the circumstances and experiences we encounter in the next. In other words, our present circumstances are the consequences of our past actions, and our future will be shaped by the choices we make today. This notion urges us to be mindful of our actions and take responsibility for the effects they may have on our future lives.
4. Unlocking the Past: Reincarnation offers us the possibility of exploring and understanding our past lives. Through past life regression therapy or deep meditation, we can access memories and experiences from previous incarnations. This exploration can provide valuable insights into our current behaviors, patterns, and relationships, helping us to heal and grow on a deeper level.
5. Continuity of the Soul: The belief in reincarnation suggests that our souls are eternal and connected to a higher, universal consciousness. It implies that our individual identities are merely temporary manifestations, and we are part of something much greater. This interconnectedness reminds us that we are not alone in our journey and that our experiences are shared by countless others on their own paths of self-discovery.
Exploring the Concept of Reincarnation
Reincarnation is a fascinating concept that has captured the imagination of people across cultures and religions for centuries. It offers a fresh perspective on the mysteries of life and death, inviting us to question the purpose and meaning of our existence.
1. The Cycle of Birth and Death
Reincarnation is based on the belief that life is not a singular event but rather a continuous cycle of birth and death. When we die, our soul is said to separate from the physical body and embark on a spiritual journey, only to be reborn into a new body in a future life. This cycle repeats itself until we reach a state of spiritual enlightenment or liberation.
2. Karma and Reincarnation
Central to the concept of reincarnation is the idea of karma, the law of cause and effect. According to this principle, our actions in this life and past lives shape our future experiences. Positive actions lead to positive outcomes, while negative actions result in suffering or challenges in future lives. Reincarnation offers the opportunity for us to learn from our past mistakes and make amends, ultimately guiding us towards spiritual growth.
3. Unlocking Past Lives
One fascinating aspect of reincarnation is the possibility of accessing past lives through regression therapy or deep meditation. By delving into our subconscious minds, we can uncover memories or experiences from previous lifetimes. These glimpses into our past can provide valuable insights, helping us understand recurring patterns, relationships, and unresolved issues in our current life.
4. Eternal Souls and Interconnectedness
The belief in reincarnation suggests that our souls are eternal and connected to a higher consciousness. It reminds us that we are not isolated individuals, but rather interconnected beings on a journey of self-discovery. Our shared experiences and interactions with others are part of a larger tapestry of spiritual growth, where each soul has its own unique path.
Reincarnation is a concept that encourages us to expand our perspective and explore the deeper mysteries of our existence. It reminds us that our journey does not end with death, but continues through the infinite cycle of birth and rebirth. By embracing the concept of reincarnation, we open ourselves to profound self-exploration and the potential for spiritual evolution.
Stay tuned for the next section, where I’ll delve into the different theories surrounding reincarnation and their historical significance.
The Law of Reincarnation: A Fundamental Principle
The concept of reincarnation has been a fundamental principle in various spiritual traditions and belief systems for centuries. It is based on the idea that after death, the soul is reborn into a new body, beginning a new life cycle. As a firm believer in the law of reincarnation, I find this concept fascinating and profound.
Reincarnation offers a different perspective on life and death. It suggests that our existence is not limited to a single lifetime but is part of a continuous journey of growth and evolution. Each life presents us with new opportunities for learning, self-discovery, and spiritual development.
One of the key aspects of the law of reincarnation is the idea of karma. Karma is the belief that our actions in this life and past lives shape our future experiences. It operates on the principle of cause and effect, suggesting that the choices we make and the energy we put out into the world have a ripple effect on our future lives.
Reincarnation provides a deeply empowering belief system. It suggests that we have the ability to break free from the cycle of birth and death through personal growth, self-awareness, and spiritual transformation. It reminds us that each life is an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and make wiser choices, ultimately leading to soul liberation and enlightenment.
With the understanding of reincarnation, we can also gain insights into our current life challenges, relationships, and experiences. By tapping into regression therapy or meditation, we can potentially unlock memories of past lives, gaining a deeper understanding of ourselves and our soul’s journey.
Reincarnation also highlights the interconnectedness of all living beings. It suggests that our souls are eternal and connected to a higher consciousness. It’s a reminder that we are not alone in our pursuit of self-discovery and growth. Each individual has their own unique journey, but we are all interconnected, sharing collective experiences and lessons.
The law of reincarnation is a fundamental principle that offers a profound perspective on life and death. It provides an empowering belief system based on the principles of karma, personal growth, and interconnectedness. By exploring this concept, we can expand our understanding of existence and unlock the hidden mysteries of our soul’s journey.
A Cycle of Rebirth: Understanding the Essence of Reincarnation
Reincarnation is a captivating concept that offers a unique perspective on the mysteries of life and death. It suggests that our existence is not confined to a single lifetime, but rather, it is part of a continuous cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. This idea is found in various spiritual traditions and belief systems around the world, each with its own interpretations and understandings.
At its core, the concept of reincarnation speaks to the notion that our soul or consciousness is eternal and continues to evolve through multiple lifetimes. It suggests that every individual has lived in previous incarnations and will continue to live in future ones. This understanding of the eternal nature of our being opens up a vast realm of possibilities for personal growth and spiritual transformation.
One of the fundamental principles underlying reincarnation is the law of karma. Karma refers to the concept that our actions, thoughts, and intentions have consequences that shape our future experiences. In other words, the choices we make in one lifetime can influence the circumstances and lessons we encounter in subsequent lives. This understanding of karma emphasizes personal responsibility and the importance of living with intention and integrity.
While the idea of reincarnation may seem abstract or mystical to some, it has practical implications for how we live our lives. Embracing the concept of reincarnation encourages us to view each experience as an opportunity for growth and learning. It reminds us that our current circumstances are not the result of mere chance, but rather the culmination of past choices and actions. This understanding can inspire us to make conscious decisions that align with our highest values and aspirations.
Moreover, the concept of reincarnation highlights the interconnectedness of all living beings. If we accept that we have lived multiple lives and will continue to do so, then it follows that every person we encounter is also on their own unique journey of growth and evolution. This awareness can foster compassion, empathy, and a deeper sense of unity with all of humanity.
In the quest to understand the deeper mysteries of existence, the concept of reincarnation offers a profound and thought-provoking framework. It invites us to explore the nature of our soul, the power of our choices, and the potential for endless growth and transformation. By embracing the essence of reincarnation, we embark on a journey of self-discovery and awakening, unlocking the hidden wisdom that resides within us.
Unveiling the Ancient Wisdom: Reincarnation in Different Cultures and Civilizations
One of the most fascinating aspects of the concept of reincarnation is its presence in various cultures and civilizations throughout history. The belief in multiple lifetimes and the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth can be found in ancient wisdom traditions from all corners of the world. In this section, we will explore some of the different perspectives on reincarnation in different cultural and spiritual traditions.
- Hinduism: Reincarnation holds a central place in Hindu philosophy. According to Hindu beliefs, a soul is reborn into a new body after death, with the nature of the next life’s experiences determined by the accumulated karma from previous lives.
- Buddhism: Buddhism, which originated from Hinduism, embraces the concept of reincarnation, but with a slightly different interpretation. In Buddhism, the cycle of rebirths, known as Samsara, is seen as a cycle of suffering. The goal is to break free from this cycle by attaining enlightenment, ultimately achieving liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
- Ancient Egypt: The ancient Egyptians also held a belief in reincarnation. They believed in the concept of a soul’s journey through different realms and the opportunity for spiritual growth through multiple lifetimes. Egyptians would mummify their deceased loved ones to ensure the preservation of the physical body for the soul’s return in the afterlife.
- Native American Traditions: Many Native American cultures embrace the belief in reincarnation. They view death as a transition rather than an end, and the soul is believed to continue its journey in different bodies and forms, including animals and plants.
- Druidism: Druidic traditions from the Celtic cultures also encompass the notion of reincarnation. They believe in the cyclical nature of life and death, where the soul leaves one body and enters another, carrying with it the wisdom and experiences gained from previous lifetimes.
These are just a few examples of how the concept of reincarnation has permeated different cultural and spiritual traditions across the globe. It is a testament to the universality of this ancient wisdom and the human desire to understand the mysteries of life and death. By exploring these diverse perspectives, we can deepen our understanding and appreciation of the profound implications and possibilities that reincarnation offers to our spiritual journey.

Contemplating Our Purpose and Actions in the Context of Reincarnation
As I explore the concept of reincarnation further, I am intrigued by how it challenges us to contemplate our purpose and actions in this life. The belief in the law of reincarnation suggests that our present existence is not an isolated event, but rather part of a larger cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.
Reincarnation teaches us that our actions in this life have consequences that extend beyond our current existence. It proposes the idea of karma, the law of cause and effect, which suggests that our actions in this lifetime will determine our experiences in future lives. This prompts us to reflect on the choices we make, the impact they have on others, and the long-term consequences they may have for ourselves.
Understanding that our actions carry forward into future lives encourages us to live with intention and consideration for others. It reminds us that we are not only responsible for our own well-being, but also for the well-being of our fellow beings and the world we inhabit. This realization empowers us to take an active role in creating a better future for ourselves and future generations.
Contemplating reincarnation also leads us to question the purpose of our existence. If we believe in the concept of multiple lives, we must consider why we continue to come back and what lessons we are meant to learn. This line of inquiry invites personal reflection and self-discovery. It encourages us to seek a deeper understanding of ourselves, our relationships, and the world around us.
In the context of reincarnation, it becomes crucial to live a life aligned with our inner values and higher purpose. When we contemplate the larger cycle of birth and rebirth, we realize that our time here is limited and precious. Each moment becomes an opportunity to grow, learn, and make a positive impact.
By embracing the concept of reincarnation, we open ourselves to a richer understanding of our purpose and the interconnectedness of all life. It prompts us to live with consciousness, compassion, and a sense of responsibility. As I continue to explore this ancient wisdom, I am inspired to live more mindfully and strive for personal growth in every incarnation I may have.

"Interest receivable is an amount of interest that is owed but has not yet been paid. Usually interest receivable is expected to be paid within a year, making it a current asset. The A/R turnover ratio is a measurement that shows how efficient a company is at collecting its debts. It divides the company’s credit sales in a given period by its average A/R during the same period. The result shows you how many times the company collected its average A/R during that time frame.
- If there is a high chance of nonpayment, an offsetting bad debt allowance for a portion of the interest receivable may be necessary, lowering the net amount of the receivable.
- In this case, the company creates an adjusting entry by debiting interest expense and crediting interest payable.
- When it collects cash against its A/R balance, a company is converting the balance from one current asset to another.
- Any investors who purchase the bonds at par are required to pay the issuer accrued interest for the time lapsed.
- Similarly, this journal entry raises total assets and income by the same amount.
- For example, the company might have an excess of funds that they earn from the operations and they might decide to invest that excess of funds to earn some more money by making a short-term or long-term deposit.
In this case, the company creates an adjusting entry by debiting interest expense and crediting interest payable. The size of the entry equals the accrued interest from the date of the loan until Dec. 31. Accrued interest is usually counted as a current asset, for a lender, or a current liability, for a borrower, since it is expected to be received or paid within one year. When analyzed over time or comparatively against competing companies, managers can better understand ways to improve the financial health of a company. Some companies issue preferred stock, which will be listed separately from common stock under this section.

These are expressed as “net 10,” “net 15,” “net 30,” “net 60,” or “net 90.” The numbers refer to the number of days in which the net amount is due and expected to be paid. For instance, if a sale is net 10, you have 10 days from the time of the invoice to pay your balance.

The Entries for Closing a Revenue Account in a Perpetual Inventory System
Some companies have a different business model and insist on being paid up front. In this case, the business doesn’t record an A/R transaction but instead enters a liability on its balance sheet to an account known as unearned revenue or prepaid revenue.

Receivables are listed as assets on the company’s balance sheet and carry a debit balance on the general ledger. Interest receivable refers to the interest that has been earned by investments, loans, or overdue invoices but has not actually been paid yet.

Under GAAP, revenue is recorded on a company’s books when it’s earned and realizable, reports Accounting Tools. In other words, interest revenue is reported once your business has fulfilled all obligations of a transaction, such as delivering goods to a customer who purchases them on credit. Interest is realizable if you fully expect to receive payment in the future. The amount of accrued interest is posted as adjusting entries by both borrowers and lenders at the end of each month. The entry consists of interest income or interest expense on the income statement, and a receivable or payable account on the balance sheet.

"Cryptocurrency Pump and Dump Scams: A Closer Look
Cryptocurrencies offer immense potential for profit, but along with that potential comes the risk of scams. One scam that has plagued the cryptocurrency market is the pump and dump scheme. In this article, we will delve into the inner workings of these scams, highlight warning signs to watch out for, and provide strategies to protect yourself from falling victim to their manipulative tactics.
Arm yourself with knowledge and vigilance as you navigate the treacherous waters of the cryptocurrency market.
Understanding Pump and Dump Scams
Pump and dump scams involve artificially inflating the price of a cryptocurrency through coordinated efforts and then selling off the inflated assets for a profit. The scammers typically target low-volume and lesser-known cryptocurrencies, as they are more susceptible to manipulation. By spreading false information and creating a sense of hype, these scammers lure unsuspecting investors into buying the cryptocurrency at inflated prices.
Warning Signs to Watch Out For
To protect yourself from pump and dump scams, it is essential to be aware of the warning signs. One common indicator is sudden and dramatic price spikes. If a cryptocurrency’s value skyrockets within a short period without any significant news or developments, it may be a red flag. Additionally, be cautious of unsolicited investment advice, especially from unknown sources or online forums. Scammers often pose as experts or insiders, enticing others to invest in the targeted cryptocurrency.
How to Protect Yourself
Fortunately, there are strategies you can employ to safeguard yourself against pump and dump scams. Firstly, conduct thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency. Look for credible sources of information, such as reputable news outlets or official project announcements. Secondly, be cautious of cryptocurrencies with low trading volumes, as they are more susceptible to manipulation. Stick to well-established and regulated exchanges to minimize the risk of falling victim to fraudulent schemes.
Additionally, it is crucial to trust your instincts. If an investment opportunity seems too good to be true, it probably is. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear of missing out (FOMO) and instead take a measured and rational approach to investing. By staying informed, skeptical, and patient, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of falling prey to pump and dump scams.
Cryptocurrency pump and dump scams are a real threat to investors in the cryptocurrency market. By understanding the mechanics of these scams, recognizing warning signs, and employing protective strategies, you can minimize the risk of becoming a victim.

Participation in crypto gifting carries significant risks, as it can result in financial losses for those who don’t fully comprehend the associated risks. Therefore, it’s imperative to approach offers of crypto gifting with caution and skepticism, as they may be scams designed to defraud unsuspecting individuals.
Q: What’re cryptocurrency pump and dump scams?
A: Cryptocurrency pump and dump scams are schemes where individuals or groups artificially inflate the price of a cryptocurrency through coordinated buying, creating a ‘pump,’ and then sell their holdings at the inflated price, causing the price to crash, or ‘dump.’
Q: How do these scams work?
A: Pump and dump scams typically involve a group of individuals who coordinate their buying and selling activities to manipulate the price of a cryptocurrency. They often use social media platforms or messaging apps to spread false information or hype about the cryptocurrency, enticing others to buy and drive up the price. Once the price reaches a certain level, the scammers sell their holdings, causing the price to plummet and leaving other investors with significant losses.
Q: How can I avoid falling victim to pump and dump scams?
A: To avoid pump and dump scams, it’s important to be cautious and skeptical of any investment opportunity that promises quick and guaranteed profits. Do thorough research on the cryptocurrency and its underlying technology before investing. Be wary of unsolicited investment advice or information from unknown sources. Additionally, avoid joining groups or communities that promote pump and dump activities.
Q: Are cryptocurrency pump and dump scams legal?
A: Pump and dump scams are often illegal as they involve market manipulation and fraud. In many jurisdictions, these activities are considered securities fraud and can result in severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment. However, the legality may vary depending on the specific jurisdiction and the regulations in place.
Q: What’re the risks involved in participating in pump and dump scams?
A: Participating in pump and dump scams can lead to significant financial losses.

Additionally, participating in pump and dump schemes can expose individuals to legal risks and reputational damage.
Q: Is it possible to recover funds lost in a pump and dump scam?
A: Recovering funds lost in a pump and dump scam can be challenging. Cryptocurrency transactions are often irreversible, and scammers typically take steps to conceal their identities, making it difficult to track them down. It’s crucial to report the scam to the appropriate authorities and seek legal advice to explore any possible avenues for recovery.
Q: Can pump and dump scams occur in other markets besides cryptocurrencies?
A: While pump and dump scams are most commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, they can occur in other markets as well.

"“Responsibility is to keep the ability to respond.” — Robert Duncan
One of the greatest challenges on the spiritual path is to realize that you are responsible for your life and your choices. At first this can feel like a heavy burden or assuming you are to blame for everything in your life. The best way to understand responsibility is to realize that be taking responsibility for something you are giving yourself the ability to respond to what it. If you don’t take responsibility, you can’t actually do anything about something for which you are not willing to take responsibility, not for creating it, but for responding to it.
When something happens in your life, blaming yourself or looking for who’s at fault simply keeps you stuck in being a victim. Taking responsibility means looking at the choices that you now have before you.. What is the healthiest, sanest, most wholesome choice you can make, from where you are right now? What choice can you make the makes the greatest contribution or makes a difference. Now you aren’t a victim nor are you stuck. Now you are taking responsibility for your life!
Reflection: Is there some part of my life for which I don’t want to take responsibility? How could I engage my ability to respond? What new choice does that give me?
Affirmation: I am willing and capable of taking responsibility for me life. I have the ability to respond to any situation or circumstance because I have the help and support of Spirit!!",<urn:uuid:9839e050-209e-445f-8ace-11d68f27c622>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://csldallas.org/accepting-responsibility/,2024-02-20T21:35:24Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9667367339134216,310,1.5847312211990356,2
"We live in a same world. And we must take care of it all together. This is the main goal of the project SAME World, realized by 13 European NGOs and 12 associated organizations in order to shine a light on a theme which is currently a hot topic: the relationship between migrations and climate changes.
The project will be presented during a press conference on Tuesday 20th October at Expo Milano 2015, in Cascina Triulza, the exhibition area dedicated to the Civil Society.
SAME World (www.sameworld.eu) is a European-wide project – realized during the European Year of Development 2015 - whose aim is to involve students and teachers in building a new awareness on the relationship between poverty and environmental damages.
Wars, overexploitation of natural resources, deforestations, drought: these problems are directly linked to the current model of development, which has a serious impact on the weakest areas of the world, forcing people to move abroad looking for better living conditions.
The safeguard of natural resources, the adoption of sustainable development policies, the struggle against poverty and a fairer distribution of wealth: all of these concrete actions represent an effective way to involve governments and citizens in building a new model of development, based on environmental justice.
The first step is investing in education: project partners will create an educational kit for students and teachers, which includes topics on environmental justice, environmental migrants and climate change.
One of the main goals of the project SAME World is to involve actively citizenship and students: sensitization campaigns and educational activities will be organized in the schools.
In addition, virtual education platform, mutual learning sessions, European student camping etc. will be implemented.

"On Wednesday, the Committee for Education Funding (CEF) and the Coalition for National Science Funding (CNSF) co-hosted a webinar highlighting the importance of further investments in STEM. The panel spoke amid the House Appropriations Committee’s recent approval of FY 24 funding levels that could lead to a significant cut of almost 30% to the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. With critical STEM education funding in jeopardy, the panel outlined the existing impact and further need for STEM investments.
Dr. Amy Burke of the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics presented her organization’s data regarding the development of STEM talent. When analyzing the composition of talent in STEM fields, she emphasized the prevalence of workers in the science- and engineering-related occupational group that did not hold a bachelor's degree. As conversations about STEM talent often focus on bachelor's degree holders, she provided a more inclusive view of the STEM field that highlighted the role of all workers. Additionally, Dr. Burke presented data that emphasized the significant underrepresentation of Black, Latino and Native American science and engineering degree recipients at the bachelor’s level and above relative to their population shares. Another gap identified was that students eligible for free or reduced lunch programs tested proficient in the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) science assessment significantly less than their peers. These data sets highlight areas that demand new or further investment in STEM education.
With the backdrop of this data, Dr. Andre Green, professor and Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs at the University of Southern Alabama, shared his personal STEM educational journey. He recounted underinvestment in STEM programs at his school in rural Georgia, but mentioned that his teachers' support and investments from the National Science Foundation propelled him to continue on a STEM path. He explained how he embodied the investment in STEM and is an example of why the government must allocate more funding to STEM education.
To facilitate such STEM education, Billy Mawhiney, Executive Director of the South Dakota Afterschool Network, emphasized the importance of after-school programs in providing students with exposure to STEM. To expand such exposure, his organization is developing “Think, Make, Create” Mobile Labs that will bring STEM activities to kids across South Dakota this summer. As part of these efforts, the organization particularly seeks to provide STEM experiences to Native American students who are underrepresented in STEM programs. This initiative and others with similar goals require further investments to create equitable access to STEM.
Presenting data, personal experiences and current initiatives, the panel highlighted the importance of STEM education and the need for greater investments. While not a focus of the panel specifically, supporting and expanding CTE programs is another important way to address the need to develop students with the knowledge and skills necessary for STEM-related jobs.",<urn:uuid:1dddd627-4237-4864-a33d-be41e283339d>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://ctepolicywatch.acteonline.org/stem/,2024-02-20T23:03:06Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.943689227104187,565,2.4669251441955566,2
"OHS got very different feedback on their Cost Cap project from two outside committees last week. The Healthcare Cabinet, chaired by OHS, was very supportive with one exception. In contrast, members of the Medicaid Oversight Council shared concerns only.
In some respects, this reflects the differing experiences with past reforms between Medicaid and commercial plans. Completely controlled by state government and having achieved impressive progress in controlling costs while improving quality, Medicaid has a lot to lose and too often reforms are imposed there (to solve problems that don’t exist there) because policymakers can. In contrast, consumer costs in commercial insurance are high and rising in Connecticut, while quality and value are average at best. However, the state has few levers to improve value in private plans.
The difference in receptivity to the Cost Cap is likely also due to very different stakeholders at each table. Cabinet membership is dominated by industries and state agencies with minimal consumer advocacy. MAPOC, on the other hand, has real world providers, decent consumer representation, and a long history of engagement and collaboration while holding administrators accountable.
Feedback from the Cabinet last Tuesday, with one exception, focused on provider reimbursements, details of how higher primary care spending will be implemented, how OHS will adjust for the impact of COVID, and dismissing any potential for underservice or other unintended consequences. OHS confirmed that they still intend to pursue controversial Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs) to enforce the Cost Cap. PIPs would be negotiated in secret with any payer or entity OHS says exceeded their Cap. The bill to implement PIPs did not pass this year because the legislative session ended early. OHS’s
In contrast, on Friday MAPOC members raised concerns about the Cost Cap including inadequate underservice monitoring, harm to vulnerable Medicaid members, the danger of PIPs to enforce the Cap, the lack of public input in Cost Cap planning, and jeopardizing hard won value improvements in the program.
Several members believed that quality improvement should be implemented before the Cost Cap rather than after. OHS’s consultant replied that, while they were not involved in drafting the Governor’s Executive Order, the reason quality reporting is delayed until after the Cost Cap is because it is hard to get consensus among providers about how and what to measure. There was no explanation for why providers, who will be subject to the measures, are driving that process.
A concern was offered that doubling primary care spending while reducing the total cost of healthcare is likely to cut other critical care, that research suggests that doubling primary care spending is not likely to start re-orienting the healthcare system toward primary care. Advocates have offered at least 38 better, safer, and more effective ways to support primary care in Connecticut. Concerns about primary care crowding out other critical services, especially important to the Medicaid population, were dismissed.
It was suggested that using economic measures to Cap healthcare costs is inappropriate. Healthcare availability should not depend year-to-year on gas prices or unemployment; in fact, a recession with high unemployment is the worst time to limit healthcare services.
Another concern centered on granting such extraordinary power to one agency with limited accountability or transparency, lasting into future administrations. Advocates are concerned about OHS’s track record in policymaking including increasing costs for patients and the state and increasing barriers to primary care access for over low-income 25,000 New Haven residents and plans to sell consumers’ sensitive medical records to insurers, large health systems, and potentially others.
Concerns were raised about using 2020 and 2021 as benchmark years to calculate the Cap, given the impact of the pandemic on healthcare spending.
According to OHS, the rush to implement the Cost Cap was due to public pressure. While it is true that policymakers are hearing strong concerns from voters about the costs of healthcare, it is not clear that voters would approve sacrificing quality or access to care to lower costs. In the past, bare bones insurance plans were not popular.
A further concern was raised about how unnecessary care would be identified and cut. A consumer advocate noted that the Cost Cap project is not giving consumers enough credit to know what works.
Concerns were raised that although proponents claim that the Cost Cap will result in lower consumers costs, there is no provision for that. It is entirely possible that only corporate entities will see any savings leaving consumers still paying too much.
Concerns were also raised about the cost of implementing the Cost Cap, estimated at $3.3 million by OFA five years ago.",<urn:uuid:58319c78-8293-4fb8-a157-9f7f2a62d807>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://cthealthpolicy.org/cost-cap-outside-input-very-different-depending-on-perspectives/,2024-02-20T22:41:18Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.96766197681427,928,1.2430260181427002,1
"Yet another fantastically lucky day for me by the looks of it. In my email this morning I’ve already won stacks of iPod Nano’s, bucket-loads of Gift Cards from Foot Locker / Starbucks / JC Penny / Walmart … and oh, oh oh.. let’s not forget the 10,000,000 I’ve won on the “UK Lottery”. Great stuff! I can add that to the $1.5 million I’ve won in the “PW National Lottery” and the $3.5 million I’ve won in the “Sweeps stake Lottery International”. Look, look below.. it just has to be real…
“We happily announce to you the draw of the Sweeps stake Lottery International programs held on the 1st of Jan 2005 in London. Your e-mail address attached to ticket number: 644 79543465 B44 which subsequently won you the lottery in the 3rd category.
You have therefore been approved to claim a total sum of US$3,500,000.00(Three Million Five Hundred United States Dollars)”
It was held on the 1st of January ? Blimey, it’s taken them a while to tell me hasn’t it ? Stiil, all I have to do is email some guy at a random yahoo.com address and he’ll send me the cash. Not bad for a days work is it? All I did was click “Send / Receive”!
Arseholes… absolute arseholes.. It’s all total crap of course. It gets to the point where you question more than just email. Email is a crap way of telling someone something good. Even if someone you know says… “Hey, you’re great – I’m gonna send you ten quid”, I’d probably say, “Yeah right.. WHATever!”
I think it eventually spills over into everyday life. You become dubious of any offer. Automated diallers ring my home phone in the evening and some American recorded voice bellows down my phone..
“Hi. I’m calling from US Villas to tell you that you have been selected to win a two week holiday in Florida, stopping at one of our 5-star villas. Just press 9 to speak to a representative and claim your prize!”
I’ve grown tired of slamming the phone down now, as I do with the people who call my mobile and say…
“Hiya, I’m Mr Pleb from ThePhoneCompany.com and I was wondering if you were interested in a brand new Nokia 2837 with flashy things and Crazy Frog ringtones”
No, no I don’t want it. I’d rather listen to George Bush for an hour and ask him how many states there are in America. See, you can’t tell these people to sod off. If you say, “Stop calling me! AGH! F**k off you low life!!!”, they’ll say, “Sorry Sir, we just have a computer which creates random numbers starting with 07866″… my ARSE! So why have I got 20 missed calls from “Unknown Number” then Mr Pleb ?
So anyway, I’ll switch back to the recorded voice from the Villa company. I now find that pressing “9” gives you free range to annoy the hell out of them. Pressing “9” gets you to a real person. It’s some temp sitting in the offices of “RipOff Villa Hire” in Texas or somewhere….
“Hello, my name’s Tabitha, I’ll be taking your call today. How can I help you?”
“It’s about the prize.”
“Yes sir, congratulations. Can I take your name and phone number, then I’ll be able to process your claim right away.”
“Well, you’ve already got that haven’t you?”
“Errr…. Yes sir, but we need to confirm it first so that we can validate your claim.”
(She’s obviously wise to this line of questioning)
“OK. Well, I think you may have my girlfriends’ name. Her name is Heather Horny, and the number is 0906 55 66 44. Call her anytime. Do you need to speak to her? She’s not here right now.”
“No, no that’s fine Sir. We’ll get your claim processed right away.”
“I’m .. I’m not sure… OK. For the next stage of the claim I’ll need to inform you of a small claim fee which we..”
“Sir, I think we may have someone else on the line..”
“Sir, I’m going to call you back on your girlfriends number, I think we have a problem on the line..”
“Cheesy cheese burgers”
I did actually do this the other day and she was confused as hell. I’m hoping that she tried to call the number too, which will probably get her through to some random adult chat-line. So yeah, I’m constantly dismissive of “free” offers. Anything that’s too good to be true probably is. In fact, if I ever actually do win something – something real, that exists – I’ll probably ignore it or bin it. If I opened the door tomorrow morning and there was a scantily-clad woman, camera crew, baloons and a guy with a large cheque saying, “To Mr. Leigh Geary – 4,504,000. Signed, National Lottery”, I’d probably tell them to all go and shove it where the sun doesn’t shine, then slam the door shut.
Right, I’d better go. My free Rolex is telling me that it’s nearly lunch time. I’ve got loads to do – there’s this email from “Ms. Mariam Mohammed” which I’ve got to reply to…
“…I am Ms.Mariam Mohamed the wife of the late Dr. Rashidi Mohammed who was one of the aid to the former leader of my country Iraq before he was killed in a war in my as a surprise but I honestly do not intend to surprise you. I write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of US $20,000,000.00 with you. The fund is now with the Financial Firm .In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 28% of the total fund”
..wow, now there’s a deal. All I need to do is call +66-1-3821283 .. Hmm.. that’s a number in Thailand .. strange.. I thought she was in Iraq.. she gets about doesn’t she ??! I’ll bet .. I’ll bet a fairly hefty sum (I’ve got several million in winnings, so I’m ok for cash).. I’ll bet that if I called this number I’d get Tabitha from the bloody Villa place!
However, I don’t have time to call her. I’m far to busy buying “Che4p p3nny st0ck!”. Apparently these stocks are set to “explode” any day. Wow.. it’s a good job that only I have this email and no-one else isn’t it ?!
I’ve also got some cheap software and muscle-boosting pills to buy. There’s also some other pills, which I’m a bit confused about. I can’t quite figure out if I want the pills that “put inches on” or the ones that “take inches off”.. strange. Maybe I’ll just not buy them and then I’ll stay the same?
I’m really in demand too – I’ve got about 20 emails from people asking me to join their company. Wow! All these years I’ve been working hard to learn stuff, to educate myself and climb the career ladder, then suddenly I get an offer of $600 a week working for some random “finance company”. Wow.. Lucky me eh ?..
“Today we are looking for financial assistants that will be responsible to accept payments from clients through bank transfer, because of imperfection of bank system. UK partners of our clients have some difficulties with sending bank translations and cheques.”
Wait up.. I think this may be the problem that Ms. Mariam Mohamed is having! Aha! If I can get that job then I could help to put her massive cheque into my own bank account AND steal some cash out of the bank at the same time!
Anyway.. I’ve really got to go now.

"Here are some of my favorite Charlottesville blog entries from the past week
Anoop Ranganath reviews his dining-out experiences of the week. Let me just say that I’m jealous that he eats out so much. Orbit good. Mellow Mushroom and Sticks eh. Old Virginia Fried Chicken good. Martha’s too slow. Tokyo Rose service atrocious. Sheetz’s nachos awesome. Anoop promises more each week.
Andrew Hersey is freaked out that people from his past keep showing up in his life again. His theory? Good karma.
Jennifer doesn’t understand why Democratic Council candidates don’t have their yard signs out yet. Former party chair Lloyd Snook replied explaining that Schilling broke the no-signs-before-the-Dogwood-Festival deal and caught the Dems unawares.
Dave Norris is worried that the revitalization of Cherry Avenue will destroy its social, historical, and cultural fabric. Smart guy that he is, he proposes a solution involving a Community Development Corporation working with residents and developers to lift up the neighborhood intact, rather than pricing out the lifelong residents.
Bill Emory looks back at the Woolen Mills’ sewage problems in 1917 and doesn’t see that much has changed. Because he’s Bill, he includes an awesome photo that’s also pretty gross—the RWSA outlet into Moores Creek with a sketchy-looking foam on top of the water.
Joe Stirt is amazed by a crazy-cool service that tracks, in real time, what songs are playing on the radio. yes.com tracks some area stations, including WNRN which is, at this second, playing Nelly’s “Grillz.” If it weren’t for the internet, I would have to suffer the indignity of walking across the room and turning on the radio to find that out. WNRN’s top 5: Foo Fighters’ “No Way Back,” Nada Surf’s “Imaginary Friends,” Gorillaz’ “Dare,” Flyleaf’s “I’m So Sick,” and Blue October’s “Hate Me.” I’ve never heard of 3/5 of those artists.
Cory Capron had a run-in with a bobcat at 1:30 yesterday morning. I’m guessing his whacking stick isn’t going to do the trick; I’d best loan him my rifle.
Brian Wheeler provides the audio of the first City Council candidate forum, held a few nights ago by the 10th & Page Neighborhood Association.
And, finally, “Patience Crabstick” (I love that pseudonym) visited a health food store in town only to have a woman recite poetry when the check-out line was held up. Apparently she wasn’t crazy—she just wanted to read her poem. A poem about vegetables. Patience doesn’t report if it was any good.",<urn:uuid:9eaa070b-2d78-4115-a6c0-207b55268a79>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://cvillenews.com/2006/03/31/blog-round-up-5/,2024-02-20T21:25:17Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9547253251075745,645,0.9359925985336304,1

"The growth of the Android market has increased the demand for testing applications on this platform. Android App Testing is a type of manual testing done by testers and quality analysts to test the application on real smartphones and tablets. Some general tests like usability and compatibility with different screen sizes, screen resolutions, and browsers are executed during this testing.
It is challenging for testers with no experience in mobile devices to perform these tests effectively. You’ll need to test your app on as many devices as possible because every device is different and can present different challenges. For Android App Developers who don’t have much knowledge about Android App Testing, this article will prove to be helpful as it covers all the topics discussed above in a simplistic way.
Android app testing is testing an Android application before it is released to the public. Android app testing is different from traditional web application testing because of the following reasons:
- Android applications are dynamic, which means they behave differently on different devices with different versions of Android OS.
- They also have access to different sensors like GPS, camera, etc.
- Android apps are more complex than web applications as they can use various services running in the background.
- They also connect to various external sources like databases and APIs.
- Android apps have user interfaces that must be tested for usability and functionality.
It is a vital step in the development cycle and helps ensure that an app is ready for release.
There are many benefits of Android app testing, but here are just a few:
- Android apps are complex programs with many features and functionalities. As a result, there are bound to be some bugs in them. These bugs can make an app crash or malfunction. It’s essential to identify these bugs so that they can be fixed before releasing the app to the public.
- Android app testing helps in ensuring the quality of an application by checking for bugs, errors, usability issues, and other problems. This can be done by testing the application from different perspectives like functionality, performance, security, etc.
- Android provides a secure environment for its users by providing several layers of security such as encryption, authentication, etc. However, these features need to be tested to ensure they work properly.
- Automated Android App Testing also helps improve user experience by identifying the defects in the application, which may cause problems during execution or after release. This helps to eliminate any bugs and errors from your application so that it can provide a smooth user experience to its users.
- Performance optimization is another critical benefit of Android app testing because if there are any performance issues, then they can be identified in advance through this process to avoid any negative impact on users’ experience with your app.
Mobile app testing can be performed at different levels:
Various types of testing are performed on a mobile app before it’s released for public use. However, functional testing is one of the most important types of testing that should be performed on an Android app.
It helps you to ensure that your application works as expected. With functional testing, you can check if your application is performing as planned and that it meets the requirements of the users. Functional testing should be performed on both the new and existing features in your app.
Some of the things that you need to test during functional testing include:
- Working on each feature (e.g., login, sign up)
- Working on all buttons and menus
- The responsiveness of different pages or screens of your application
Compatibility testing is the process of testing an application across all the devices, operating systems, and platforms that it supports. A mobile app needs to be compatible with all the devices that run on different operating systems. This can only be achieved by compatibility testing.
This is especially important when launching an app in multiple countries or regions because there are often differences in device capabilities and operating systems.
We need to test our mobile app on different devices because each device has its specifications and screen size, which might not be suitable for our application. Some features might work adequately on one device while they may not work on another device or operating system.
To ensure that your app is compatible with different devices, you should test it on as many devices as possible before releasing it.
Integration testing is a type of software testing which ensures that all the components of an application work together and integrate well. It is done in the later stages of Android App Automation Testing.
Integration Testing helps in ensuring that:
- All modules are working as expected
- Components are integrated correctly, and their interfaces are compatible with each other
- There are no conflicts between different modules or components
Performance testing is a process of checking the performance of your product or application. It can be done manually or automated. Performance testing ensures that your product performs well under different conditions and stress tests. Performance testing involves checking the behavior of applications under different levels of load, stress, and resource usage. This helps you to determine what happens when multiple users access the application at the same time. Performance Testing also includes load testing, which is used to determine the maximum number of users that an application can handle without any degradation in its performance.
Network testing is the process of testing your app against the real-world internet. This includes ensuring that your app loads quickly, works offline, and can handle errors.
Network testing is crucial because it helps you catch issues that would otherwise appear in production after release. Network testing is essential when testing email clients, online games, and other apps that require fast connections. Without network testing, there’s no way of knowing whether your app will work on slow networks or even if it’ll be able to connect at all!
- It helps them find out if their app is working correctly or not.
- It lets them know if their app is performing well or not in different types of networks.
- It tests the performance of an application by simulating real-life scenarios like browsing websites, sending emails, etc.
Here are some of the most common issues you need to be aware of:
- Slow load times: If your app takes more than 5 seconds to load, users will abandon it. Check to see if your app launches quickly.
- Error handling: Make sure that errors are handled and don’t prevent users from using the app. If a user tries to sign in to your app and an error occurs, they will often close their browser or phone and not try again later when they have time.
- Offline functionality: Make sure your app works offline and online so users can use it even when there’s no internet connection available (e.g., on a plane).
Security testing is a process of identifying vulnerabilities in the application. It is also known as penetration testing, conducted to identify security threats, design flaws, and loopholes that hackers can exploit. Security testing is necessary for all organizations, primarily financial, healthcare, government, and defense industries.
The importance of security testing is that it helps detect and prevent any security flaws such as SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), etc., which can lead to data theft or loss of sensitive information.
Hackers can exploit vulnerable code to gain unauthorized access to the application, steal confidential data and manipulate system functionalities.
Security testing ensures that an application:
- It is developed according to security standards and guidelines;
- It does not have any loopholes that attackers can use; and
- Has the necessary mechanisms for detecting and preventing attacks on the application’s resources
Interrupt testing is the process of identifying and fixing bugs that occur when a user is interacting with your app. An interruption may be caused by a call coming through during a game or while you are writing an email, or any other time when the user is performing a task on their phone. How your app responds to these interruptions can be crucial for its success or failure.
The primary purpose of interrupt testing is to check the responsiveness of your app. If a user is tapping on a button or link, the app should respond to that action as soon as possible. Interrupt testing also ensures that there are no crashes or bugs that impede the responsiveness of your app.
The ideal time for interrupt testing is when users use your app in a real-world setting. For example, if you have an eCommerce app, then it is essential to perform interrupt testing when users are browsing through items on the website or adding them to their carts.
An Android testing framework is a tool that can be used to test Android apps. Automated Android App Testing is a set of classes that helps automate the testing of Android applications.
The Android testing framework provides an API for performing functional, system, and acceptance testing.
Appium is a prevalent open-source test framework for Android apps. The Appium testing framework can be used to automate any mobile app on any device or emulator. It’s completely free, trustworthy, and simple to use.
Robotium is a testing framework for Android applications. Robotium has become one of the most popular Android testing frameworks, used by many developers to perform automated functional and regression tests on their applications.
Robotium allows you to write automated UI tests for Android applications in Java through a simple yet powerful API that can test native (C++) and hybrid (Java) apps on real devices or emulators. Key features of the Robotium framework include:
- Native, hybrid, and mobile web apps are all supported;
- Simple API based on annotations;
- This framework can be used to create functions, system test cases, and user acceptance test cases.
- Robotium supports all major versions of Android, as well as Dialogs, Menus, and Activities.
- This framework automatically manages several Android activities.
The following are some basic best practices for Android App Testing are :
- Test on multiple devices
- Test on multiple OS versions
- Test with an actual device, not an emulator
- Use different screen sizes, densities, and configurations
- Test across different network connections and locations
- Test in low-bandwidth conditions (WiFi and mobile)
- Test for memory leaks and battery drain
Android App Testing is an essential phase of any application development. It should be carried out efficiently and diligently to ensure that the software has no flaws, loopholes, or defects. To complete a testing project, the testers must be skilled, experienced, and knowledgeable in this field.
It is a beneficial process that can enhance the development process, increase customer loyalty, and improve your app’s overall user experience. In conclusion, apps are getting more and more complicated these days. Therefore it’s a must to be able to test them efficiently.",<urn:uuid:cfad065f-00b0-4583-bba1-8e5deb0bf3cf>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://cybersectors.com/how-to-test-android-apps-the-right-way-a-beginners-guide-to-android-testing/,2024-02-20T22:08:07Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9426549077033997,2198,2.7993383407592773,3

"In business parlance, “market research” refers to systematically gathering and analysing information on a particular market sector or intended customer base. Insights about supply and demand, industry rivals, similar items on the market, and potential customers are all included. Typically, the price range for ready-made market research papers in Sydney is between $1,000 and $3,000. If a customer necessitates survey work, you may ask for anything from $6,000 to $20,000 to do surveys by email, phone, or snail mail. When you have a new company concept, want to create or launch a new product, or enter a new market, online market research in Sydney is essential. Before embarking on any substantial, potentially risky change, it is essential first to do thorough market research grounded in data analysis. You must conduct continuous market research to discover answers to the issues that will occur throughout the strategy’s development, execution, and optimisation stages.
Researching the market may assist you in determining your place in it and validate any assumptions you may have had about your demands. In this case, the primary research question is: Who will find your product most beneficial, and why? It is essential to analyse the size of your target market and the current demand for your product or service. Knowing who you’re selling to helps shape your product and marketing approach. To estimate your market share, you need to know where people are shopping for these goods and how much they are willing to pay. Knowing your rivals and what they provide is crucial for setting yourself apart. Competitor analysis and thorough market research both have similar aims.
Your chances of success may be estimated using accurate data on your rivals’ products and market share. You may learn more about your rivals and how they cater to their customers by using a platform like Similarweb to get this data. You may use this data to refine your value offer now.
One of the main goals of market analysts is to identify potential future developments. The dynamics of a market may be better grasped by collecting data over time. There might be significant seasonal changes in some markets. The holiday shopping season in December is a good example, but these changes are frequently not noticeable until they are measured and analysed. You may calculate their influence and the likeliness that you will continue to observe these patterns using the information gathered from your past market research. Assumptions regarding the future may be formulated based on that.
You don’t need a novel product or to be venturing into uncharted territory to benefit from doing market research. It’s a chance to make your company’s products and services better. It includes both new product launches and current product marketing and sales efforts. You need to know what people are searching for and how effectively you satisfy their expectations to dominate the market and exceed the competition. High-potential prospects may be identified via methodical investigation. A little tweak in the proper direction to your advertising, price, or client acquisition strategies may have a significant impact. Analysing your data will reveal inconsistencies or weak spots that require fixing. Finally, the goal of market research is to boost happy customers. After all, repeat business is guaranteed by happy consumers.

"Do you currently have a pimple right in the middle of your forehead, chin, nose and / or other parts of your face?
If you do and have a presentation in front of hundreds of people the next day or maybe have a hot date, then you will go to endless measures to figure out how to get rid of that zit overnight.
If you do not know what to do then you may feel lost. But by the time you finish reading this article, you will learn about some simple and all-natural remedies that you could apply on your zit to lessen its appearance and possible help it disappear the following day.
But before we continue on our discussion about natural remedies for zits, let us talk about how to get rid of zits overnight and what zits are exactly so that you could further understand what it is.
What is a zit and what causes it?
The medical term for a zit is acne vulgaris and it is one of the most common skin conditions that people encounter in their life. It is characterized by a reddish inflammation that is infected and eventually starts to corm nodules and even cysts. A zit starts to form when a pore (also called a hair follicle) starts to accumulate bacteria, dirt and oils. It could be caused by several factors such as:
- Hormonal imbalances when a person goes through puberty
- Unhealthy lifestyle (eating processed and fast foods daily, lack of sleep and exercise)
What are the natural treatments you could try out for getting rid of pimples overnight?
Although it is not a 100% sure deal that a pimple will disappear overnight, many people have claimed that they have used the following treatments and it somehow lessened the redness and inflammation of their zit the following day which really helped them out. Here are a couple natural cures for zits that you could try:
Hydrogen peroxide: This substance is known for killing bacteria and germs which are causes of acne. When it is applied on a pimple, it kills the dirty elements on the zit. Simply get a cotton bud and dip it in this solution and apply it directly to your pimple before going to bed
Toothpaste: This has been an old trick for getting rid of pimples overnight. Toothpaste has certain ingredients that could help dry out a pimple which is what needs to be done to lessen the infection. Get a cotton bud and put a very small amount of toothpaste on it. Apply it to the zit right before going to bed and wash it gently the following morning
Egg whites: You could create an egg white mask which could also help your pimple form disappearing the next day. Since it contains lysozyme, it could eat up the bacteria’s cell walls and lessen the zit’s redness and size
Baking soda: This ingredient contains anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities that could decrease the irritation on inflamed zits. Mix baking soda with water and create a mask and apply it before going to sleep
Now you have it, a few simple natural remedies to help you get rid of a zit before a big day at work and / or school. Try one ingredient at a time and do not mix them together because it could cause worsening of the pimple.",<urn:uuid:0c8d44f5-90c3-4637-a4ef-b2a4bbaca2f7>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://dailyhealthcare.net/take-care-skin-zits-how-to-rid-zits-overnight/,2024-02-20T22:11:48Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9645697474479675,681,1.70243239402771,2
"From a potential seismic shift in the price of Bitcoin to the debate on whether XRP is a security, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.
A technical gauge is pointing to an imminent and significant shift in the price of Bitcoin.
The GTI VERA Bands Indicator shows Bitcoin may be on the brink of a big move, according to Bloomberg. Whether the move is above or below BTC’s key level of $4,000 remains to be seen.
Travis Kling, the founder of crypto hedge fund Ikigai, says he doubts Bitcoin has found its bottom.
“It’s unlikely that the bottom is in for Bitcoin. I am certainly willing to change my mind, but the preponderance of evidence leads us to believe that we’ll see more lows before we head higher.”
CoinGecko has created a countdown clock for the imminent Ethereum upgrade Constantinople.
The system-wide overhaul, designed to optimize network efficiency and change Ethereum’s miner rewards policy, is set for launch in about six days.
Ripple and XRP
EToro senior market analyst Mati Greenspan says he does not believe XRP should be classified as a security.
“XRP is not a security, in my personal opinion. My best understanding is XRP is logically a utility token. The SEC may see things differently.”
Ripple is facing a few class action lawsuits accusing the company of violating state and federal securities laws by selling XRP as an unregistered security.
As reported by Crypto Briefing, Greenspan says he remains bullish on XRP in the long run.
The Stellar-based micropayments startup SatoshiPay says it now has a group of new validator nodes up and running to help power the Stellar network.
“To support further decentralisation and resilience of the Stellar network, SatoshiPay starts operating the network’s first globally distributed cluster of full validator nodes — maintaining a database of all past ledger operations, with publicly accessible history archives and the fastest available API for querying the ledger…
We are thrilled to announce that a few days ago we completed our upgrade by launching a completely redesigned cluster of full Stellar validators that are distributed across the globe: Iowa (US), Frankfurt (Germany) and Singapore.”
Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin
Binance and the team at TrustWallet just announced support for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin on both iOS and Android.
The wallet also supports Ethereum and all Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens, as well as Ethereum Classic, GoChain, POA Network, VeChain, Tron, Wanchain, Callisto, ICON and Tomochain.
The competitive blockchain-based game TronGoo is already the most popular decentralized gaming app across all three of the major blockchains – Tron, EOS and Ethereum – just days after its debut.
The game was originally developed for Ethereum, and its developers decided to port it over to Tron to make use of the network’s increased transaction speed.
TronGoo has taken the throne in less than 5 days. A huge congratulations for breaking records and becoming the #1 gaming DApp in volume (#2 in users) across all blockchains.

"In yesterday’s DM I shared news from the streets of Nepal about the impact of coronavirus there and how the Shanti community is responding to the crisis. Marianne Grosspietsch continues her report:
Our Junior Manager Bijendra met a man in very worn clothes, carrying card board pieces. When he asked, what the man wanted them for, he was told: “I go to Shanti every day, and they give me food. I collect the cardboard, so that they may use it for making briquets for cooking.”
He shared this with the other poor people who came for food, asking them to also collect cardboard. And from then on, even children came to contribute in their own way. Their activity reduces the garbage piles too – what a wonderful double effect. Gas and kerosene have become very expensive, because the border to India is locked. We want to preserve nature and avoid chopping trees for fire wood. The cardboard also creates jobs for our mentally challenged patients, who tear the pieces, soak them in water and press the briquets.
Corona may make us having to accept changes in our lifestyle here in the West, yet people in other parts of the world suffer from hunger, from lack of drinking water, from want of basic medicines…. how much reason do we have to show our gratefulness by not complaining but rather by supporting the needy.
I find in this report from the streets of Nepal another example of how creativity and art hold the key to justice and compassion. The Via transformative is born of the via creativa which in turn is born of the via negativa (including suffering) and the via positiva (the love of life). So much of the work of Shanti—as of all the work of healing, justice-making and compassion–is art work.
It is taking disparate pieces and re-arranging them; it is looking at what is and imagining what is not yet; it is facing the impossible and forging the possible—which is the difference between despair and hope.
As Aquinas reminds us, despair is about the impossible; hope is about the possible. A place like Shanti brings the possible alive, hope alive. As all art does.
We once had in our master’s program a Catholic Sister from the East Coast. I began my class on psychology and spirituality by inviting students to draw a picture of their soul—and hers was clearly dark and troubled.
Inviting her in to talk, I learned that she was an artist but her art was destroyed when her convent burned down. On being assigned to hand out mail in her institution, she found herself deeply depressed and on medications. Her mother superior told me she sent her to our program because “therapy was not working.” Through our program, including art as meditation classes, she threw off her meds and became alive again.

Queries for Contemplation
Do you agree that “corona may accept changes in our lifestyle in the West”? How might that manifest itself?
Creativity: Where the Divine and Human Meet
Because creativity is the key to both our genius and beauty as a species but also to our capacity for evil, we need to teach creativity and to teach ways of steering this God-like power in directions that promote love of life (biophilia) and not love of death (necrophilia). Pushing well beyond the bounds of conventional Christian doctrine, Fox’s focus on creativity attempts nothing less than to shape a new ethic.

"Stubby arrived in style, riding in his green pug buggy. Stubby's mom says he hates the buggy, but I think it's pretty cool. A lot of other dogs gave the buggy high marks too -- with their pee.
We all played on the beach to burn calories and make room for Nuggets. A few new friends joined in and that was superexciting. Like Miss Danielle, the genius/pugless human responsible for telling my human to drive south for sunlight a few weeks ago. And a pug named Petey + his big brother Brodie who came across the big orange bridge to meet Stubby.
Brodie, too cool for the camera
Petey's bro Brodie is just cool. He swam in the bay and didn't get cold. Dutch was shivering so bad, we had to put him in the car to warm up. What a wuss, right? I think my hussy of a human has a little bit of a crush on Petey + Brodie.
From the other side of the grey bridge came Zoey, Phoebe, Spencer and Bellatrix. Phoebe patrolled the area for invading non-pugs and Zoey was in her usual stealth mode. Spencer B + his people brought Bellatrix because her humans had to work. How cool is that? They play hard like me and Frank, but are a waaaay cuter couple.
After some serious playing, the Nuggets were served. Petey's awesome mom took this picture of the Nuggest fest. Hmmmm. Kind funny how all the bad, begging dogs are eating Nuggets, while all the good dogs sit politely and starve to death.
Of course the Nuggets didn't last very long, but everyone got to enjoy them. My human even dissected one so Bellatrix could taste the inner Nugget, without ruining her diet. I licked it clean, just to be sure. Stubby got to lick the bowl clean when it was all over.

"Why having too much estrogen can wreak havoc on your thyroid – and how to get things back to normal.
Have you and your thyroid gotten acquainted with each other lately?
Indeed, you may have, if you’re one of the 13-27 million Americans with thyroid disease Shockingly, that number is on the rise, and women are five to eight times more likely than men to get it. Why?
There’s an intimate relationship here with one of the main female hormones – estrogen – and thyroid. But first, let’s look at the thyroid gland itself, and what some common thyroid issues are.
The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland at the base of your neck, right underneath your Adam’s apple. According to the Mayo Clinic, every aspect of your metabolism is regulated by thyroid hormones, which maintain the rate at which your body uses fats and carbohydrates, regulate your body temperature, and help maintain the production of protein. When people talk about having thyroid problems, they’re typically talking about “hyperthyroidism” (an overactive thyroid) or “hypothyroidism” (an underactive thyroid) – the latter of which affects many women around the same time as, or just after, menopause. It’s also associated with stubborn weight gain. (More on that in a moment.)
Here is a partial list of symptoms for hyperthyroidism, courtesy the Mayo Clinic:
- Sudden weight loss, even when your appetite and the amount and type of food you eat remain the same or even increase
- Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) — commonly more than 100 beats a minute — irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) or pounding of your heart (palpitations)
- Increased appetite
- Nervousness, anxiety and irritability
- Tremor — usually a fine trembling in your hands and fingers
- Changes in menstrual patterns
- Increased sensitivity to heat
- Changes in bowel patterns, especially more frequent bowel movements
- An enlarged thyroid gland (goiter), which may appear as a swelling at the base of your neck
- Fatigue, muscle weakness
- Difficulty sleeping
- Skin thinning
- Fine, brittle hair
The causes for hyperthyroidism are many, with autoimmune disorders causing a large percentage of cases. It runs in families, and as with hypothyroidism, occurs more often in women than in men.
Now let’s turn our attention toward hypothyroidism, where the thyroid gland isn’t active enough. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, common symptoms of hypothyroidism include:
- Feeling cold when other people do not
- Muscle weakness
- Weight gain, even though you are not eating more food
- Joint or muscle pain
- Feeling sad or depressed
- Feeling very tired
- Pale, dry skin
- Dry, thinning hair
- Slow heart rate
- Less sweating than usual
- A puffy face
- A hoarse voice
Any of it sound familiar?
Again, thyroid disease has many potential causes. But sometimes, women find that their particular thyroid problems are linked to estrogen levels, which play a vital role in your cells’ acquisition of thyroid hormones. Let’s look at why.
When the body is low on progesterone production (as is common with stress or aging), the delicate balance with estrogen gets thrown off, causing the body to react with too much estrogen production. This results in a body state of “estrogen dominance,” which affects all kinds of functions in your body – and can hit well before menopause, even before you hit your 30s.
For most women, progesterone production starts to gradually decrease beginning at age 35. However, stress and environmental endocrine disruptors also affect hormone production, and these chemicals – the most infamous being BPA – are not found in remote, radioactive plants, but in everyday items that most of us touch regularly. Think receipts, food cans, and even feminine hygiene products. (You can get a good primer on endocrine disruptors and the top “dirty dozen” here, at Environmental Working Group’s site.)
When progesterone dips, estrogen increases, creating an uncomfortable state of affairs in your body. But for your thyroid specifically, when estrogen is out of control, the liver starts producing high levels of “thyroid binding globulin” (or TBG): a protein that binds (just like its name!) the thyroid hormone, thereby decreasing the amount of thyroid hormone that can be properly utilized by cells.
The result? Hypothyroidism, and all the attendant symptoms that come with it.
We’ve listed mostly physical symptoms above for this condition, but it’s worth considering the one emotional symptom we’ve included, depression, and the subtle ways thyroid disease can provoke it. By now, you are most likely seeing the vital connection between healthy progesterone production and estrogen levels as it affects your body. Now, let’s look at how they affect your emotions – and why your thyroid health affects them.
According to Dr. Christine Northrup, hypothyroidism and depression are related on many levels. If you don’t have enough T3 – one of your thyroid hormones, in addition to T4 – available, a whole host of neurotransmitter abnormalities can ensue, including suppression of serotonin and norepinephrine, which stabilizes mood and anxiety. That’s because ample amounts of T3 are found in the limbic system of the brain, the area that helps process emotions such as joy, panic, anger, and fear. Moreover, T3 is actually a neurotransmitter that helps regulate serotonin and norepinephrine: themselves neurotransmitters that turn on your brain’s calm, peaceful switches.
So when progesterone production wanes, and your body starts pumping out estrogen, the liver goes into TBG overdrive. And as we now know, that limits the amount of oh-so-important T3 available to your cells. When your limbic system is starved of T3, serotonin and norepinephrine suffer, and you? You, our dear reader, are sad, depressed, and sapped of motivation – and have no idea why.
For both your body then and emotional health, it’s critical to get to the root of the problem, and bring hormones back into balance. Given the above, you may think the root of all this is in tackling estrogen…and it is, in a way. But to treat it naturally and effectively, it’s best to turn to progesterone.

"It's very simple. Our government intelligence agencies are unanimous in saying that a massive crime was committed against the United States electoral system. Out intelligence community further says that this will continue in 2018 and 2020. OK, no dead bodies such as in 9/11, but our very system of government is threatened. The Russians hacked into voter rolls in 2016. If they can hack into voter rolls this time, they can wipe thousands of names off the voter rolls next time so that when you try to go vote, they are going to tell you that you weren't registered, so you have to fill out a provisional ballot, and if we happen to find your name in our system, your vote will count. No matter who it benefits, it's totally wrong. Trump stood on stage with the chief perpetrator, our enemy, and said that since he vigorously denied it, that has to be taken at least as seriously as the work of our own Justice Department. O. J. Simpson says he didn't do it, too. This is not about liberalism and conservatism. Let me repeat: This is not about liberalism and conservatism. Both senators form my home state of Arizona have vehemently condemned Trump's performance today as disgraceful. They are conservatives with the conscience of a conservative. Conservatives used to be the first to stand up for our national defense, and Ronald Reagan once told Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. If you want to point to something Obama did you think is just as bad, well, Obama is out of office and can't be impeached, and last I checked, two wrong do not make a right.

"Well, back from holiday, summer is well and truly under way so time to start the maintenance on the observatory…
This weekend (21st / 22nd June) I will be renewing the beading on the window, resealing the decking boards at the bottom of the sides, and re-staining those boards.
The sealant I used last year must have been of the wrong type as it went solid instead of being a flexible deal. Consequently, it cracked and left a few gaps for water ingress to occur. I went to my local DIY store on Saturday and bought some flexible silicon sealant in readiness!
There is quite a bit to do this year, including:
- Renewing the roof felt
- Replace roof cross-struts
- Repair door
- Install cable pipe to pier and rewire
- Install mains cable from the house
- Install red and white lighting
- Repaint pier post
- Repaint pier adapter
I daresay it won’t all get done, but the roof and struts are the most important…
Pictures will follow as work progresses.
I’ll also be be doing some work on the imaging rig.. I have acquired a WO 66 Petzval so will be testing that with the AtikOne and GP, but again, some routine maintenance stuff to do…
- Check polar alignment using drift alignment
- New library of Bias frames at -10°, -15° and -20°
- New library of Darks and Bias for the GP guider
- Install small camera on the obsy roof for playing with all-sky camera imaging
- Play and learn the lunar capture software for the GP
- And try and learn PI finally!!!

"RIVCOconnect - Digital Divide
The California Emerging Technology Fund reported in its August, 2016 Field Poll that 30 percent of Californians do not have high-speed internet and a computing device at home, and that 57 percent of low-income Californians are “under-connected” — either dependent only on a smartphone or completely offline. In addition, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a report in April, 2017 documenting that 43 percent of rural households can’t get reliable broadband.
remain largely disconnected from the digital revolution. According the Pew Research Center, one-third of adults
ages 65 and older say they never use the Internet, and roughly half (49%) say
they do not have home broadband services.
What this all means is that almost 12 million Californians, of which nearly 100,000 are Riverside County residents, are shut out from the digital economy. They cannot adequately apply for jobs, do homework, and get health and public services online.
Internet Use Increasing
Internet usage has improved over the years throughout the nation by all age groups, where you live, and educational attainment.
""The number one benefit of information technology is that it empowers people to do what they want to do. It lets people be creative. It lets people be productive.It lets people learn things they didn't think they could learn before, and so in a sense it is all about potential.""~Steve Ballmer
Educational attainment drives the use of the internet and need for broadband services.
Pew reports that a technology gap between the rich and the poor is widening U.S. inequality.
“Today high speed broadband is not a luxury, it’s a necessity.”
~President Barack Obama, 2015
“The divide in capabilities between the most-connected and the least will define who gets the valuable jobs.”
When you’re speaking about the people who live in Riverside County, you have to keep in mind that there are a lot of us – almost 2.4 million people. We are the tenth most populous county in the US and outnumber the populations of fifteen other states. We live in a 7,400 square mile landmass almost the size of New Jersey and we can be found in urban, suburban and rural locations.
We live in the desert, the mountains, in communities large and small, on Tribal Reservations and planned developments. We are widely diverse in race and ancestry. We are 47.9% Hispanic, 36.6% Caucasian, 6.2% Asian and 6% African-American. 78% of us are native-born and 22% have come to live here from another country. 60% of our households speak English only at home, with 40% communicating in their native language. We are young and old, with 7% being five years old and younger, 23% in the K-12 age range, 33% are 20 to 44 years of age, 19% are 45 to 60, and the remaining 18% are seniors over 60. In short, Riverside County does not look very different from the rest of the USA.
It's Not Easy for Everyone!
Without a doubt, life in Riverside County is rich and
rewarding for most of its residents! We
enjoy easy access to mountains, desert and the ocean. We can shop for nearly anything we desire,
attend cultural events, world class music festivals like Coachella and Stagecoach Festival, tour our high quality local wine region in Temecula, and are close to both beaches and mountains.
Our average family income is over $80,000 per year, with 27% of our
families earning over $100,000. Life is
good in Riverside County.
But wait . . . That rosy picture does not extend everywhere. Consider the following:
- 20% of all households are single-parent families
- 20% of all adults over the age of 25 have no high school diploma or equivalent
- 11% of our population is disabled
- 13% of the population is 65 years and older
- 15% speak English less than proficiently
- 25% of all families and 32% of all households earn less than $35,000
- 17% of all Riverside County residents live below the poverty line
- Over 255,000 workers are forced to commute outside the County, with almost 20% of those finding their drive takes over an hour one-way
DATA Source: www.rivcoeda.org/Demographics
To bridge the digital divide, not only is high speed access a requirement, but so is a computer or smart device and training on how to use it. That is why RIVCOconnect has created a program to refurbish used systems and make them available to those in need after they complete a training program.
What Can Be Done?
Closing the Digital Divide is a critical success factor for the quality of life and economic prosperity of our residents in Riverside County. We have taken action to launch a Digital Inclusion Program to help close the digital divide.
Digital Inclusion Program
Riverside County's Digital Inclusion Program centers on the refurbishment and donation of surplus computers and related technology equipment. The refurbished computers are donated to those who need them from throughout our community. This includes students, parents, seniors, veterans, social service recipients, and organizations who serve and support these residents.
In addition to computers we also provide computer training for those that need it, utilizing coursework prepared by Microsoft and reviewed by local educators.
Our Digital Inclusion Program enables residents to participate in our our digital world, including:
- Opportunity for higher quality of life
- Empowerment to take individual action
- Access to economic opportunities
- Basic participation K - 12 education
- Participation in the local and global community
- Provides the basic tools necessary to connect to family and friends through social networking and digital calling services
- Provides everyone the opportunity to use health, financial, legal, consumer and social services
- Builds a stronger economic community
Low Cost Internet Options
Low cost internet options are available from three current providers within Riverside County. They are:
Charter/Spectrum: Spectrum Internet Assist
- Through the Spectrum Internet Assist program, qualified households can receive 30 Mbps Internet service with no data caps, Internet modem included and no contracts required. Add in-home WiFi for $5 more per month.
AT&T: AT&T Access
- Through the AT&T Access program, qualified households can receive internet services ranging from 10 Mbps with no deposit or installation fees, no contracts required and wi-fi internet modem included.
Frontier: California Lifeline Discount Program
- Through the Frontier's California Lifeline Discount Program, qualified households can receive internet services.
Getting On Board
One of the goals of RIVCOconnect is that service be provided to all residents at an affordable cost, one that allows all residents to access high-speed connections to information, entertainment, health care, government services, employment opportunities, and educational growth.
The County of Riverside, in collaboration with its 28 cities,
two councils of government, and participating tribal nations have adopted a
common resolution of support the RIVCOconnect program. If you want to support the program please complete the survey at RIVCOconnect Survey.
Additionally, Riverside County is committed to reducing its Carbon footprint by responsibly maximizing our surplus technology equipment. The Digital Inclusion Program is a component of our County's “Green” strategy which provides more cost effective methods of handling E-waste.
Staying Connected to Community
Broadband is now a utility that is expected within every home, business and institution, just as water, sewer and power are required for any community.
Riverside County residents need better access to our local communities as well. This includes access to government services; to banking and online bill-payments; to news outlets and local bulletin boards; to keep abreast of local events and elections; to better participate in school activities such as lesson and homework submitting and performing research; to seek employment opportunities; and to make airline and hotel reservations to name but a few. All this and much more requires Broadband connectivity.
Staying connected is an essential element of life for Riverside County! Our residents – young and old, rich and poor, native and immigrant require high speed broadband services.
Unplug and Reconnect
While connecting our community and bridging the digital divide is important, taking time to unplug and reconnect with family is equally important.",<urn:uuid:ae086613-d4a6-4216-bb53-daf8b33b6595>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://data.countyofriverside.us/stories/s/RIVCOconnect-Digital-Divide/9art-us4j/,2024-02-20T23:06:49Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.946351170539856,1756,2.7122154235839844,3

Maréchaux, Isabelle et al. (2019). Data from: Leaf drought tolerance cannot be inferred from classic leaf traits in a tropical rainforest [Dataset]. Dryad. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qnk98sfbq
- Plants are enormously diverse in their traits and ecological adaptation, even within given ecosystems, such as tropical rainforests. Accounting for this diversity in vegetation models poses serious challenges. Global plant functional trait databases have highlighted general trait correlations across species that have considerably advanced this research program. However, it remains unclear whether trait correlations found globally hold within communities, and whether they extend to drought tolerance traits.
- For 134 individual plants spanning a range of sizes and life forms (tree, liana, understory species) within an Amazonian forest, we measured leaf drought tolerance (leaf water potential at turgor loss point, πtlp), together with 17 leaf traits related to various functions, including leaf economics traits and nutrient composition (leaf mass per area, LMA; and concentrations of C, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg per leaf mass and area), leaf area, water use efficiency (carbon isotope ratio), and time-integrated stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation rate per leaf mass and area. We tested trait coordination and the ability to estimate πtlp from the other traits through model selection. Performance and transferability of the best predictive model were assessed through cross-validation.
- πtlp was positively correlated with leaf area, and with N, P and K concentrations per leaf mass, but not with LMA or any other studied trait. Five axes were needed to account for >80% of trait variation, but only three of them explained more variance than expected at random. The best model explained only 30% of the variation in πtlp, and out-sample predictive performance was variable across life forms or canopy strata, suggesting a limited transferability of the model.
- Synthesis. We found a weak correlation among leaf drought tolerance and other leaf traits within a forest community. We conclude that higher trait dimensionality than assumed under the leaf economics spectrum may operate among leaves within plant communities, with important implications for species coexistence and responses to changing environmental conditions, and also for the representation of community diversity in vegetation models.

"Some people see everything as a sign. Others see nothing as a sign. We must avoid both extremes. But signs are important. What if there were no stop signs? Street signs? Caution signs? Speed limit signs? High voltage signs?
Signs serve to maintain order and prevent chaos on a day-to-day level. Prophetic signs are even more important. And they are popping up all over, pointing to the soon return of Jesus Christ. You are either ready, or you’re not. It’s that simple.
Signs are like “previews of coming attractions.” They are not the main attraction, but they point to it. Signs provide small glimpses of what the main feature will be like.
I began my studies in Bible prophecy in November 1971. By 1978 I understood and publicly taught that in the final hours of the last days certain signs would become increasingly evident:
- The world’s focus would be on the Middle East.
- Russia would begin to align with key Muslim nations.
- Israel would be surrounded by those bent on its annihilation.
- Anti-Semitism would dramatically escalate.
- Religious deception would be rampant.
- Political chaos would increase, and a political star with plausible solutions would rise up.
- Extreme famines would occur in different parts of the world.
- There would be wars and rumors of war, especially relative to the Middle East and Israel.
- Epidemics and pandemics would spread.
- Earthquakes and natural disasters would escalate in frequency and intensity.
- Technology would advance in astonishing
- Terrorism would jump to the forefront.
- There would be an abnormal emphasis on sex and materialism, and morality would be twisted.
- Betrayals, multiplying family problems, and resistance to God’s messages would be prevalent.
- A genuine, Holy Spirit-led revival would emerge as a remnant of godly believers focused on the Lord Jesus Christ and His power.
Those signs are now joining at whirlwind velocity. But much like an alarm clock, many choose to ignore it. Signs can be agitating, discomforting. Somehow we want to believe, “Maybe we’ve still got a few years or decades before these prophecies come to pass.” But the evidence tells us they are upon us now.
The Day of the Lord truly will come any day! Jesus promised, “So also, when you shall see all these things, you know that it is near, even at the doors. Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place” (Matt. 24:33–34).
It’s a simple fact
The generation that sees these signs taking place simultaneously and globally will be part of the final generation, and they will possibly experience the long-awaited return of Jesus Christ. While followers of Christ will walk in hope, faith, and great power, others will taste only anguish and distress in the days ahead.",<urn:uuid:0fd91188-b435-4b96-b633-2b332b22152a>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://davewilliams.com/signs-of-the-times/,2024-02-20T21:59:48Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9586344957351685,621,1.6621313095092773,2
"What follows isn’t meant as an indictment of Leon Schuster. It isn’t even meant as an indictment of Leon Schuster’s audience. Everyone has the right to watch whatever they want – even if it’s crap. Truth be told, we all have our guilty pleasures. Hell, I watch ‘Glee’ every week and there’s simply no excuse for that.
So, I’m not going to criticise anyone for enjoying what I think is the puerile ‘comedy’ of Schuster and his international counterparts. To each their own and all that. But the tremendous success enjoyed by Oom Leon and his ilk means that there isn’t room for any other kind of comedy on our screens. And that’s what makes me sad.
You see, I’m both a writer and a fan of comedy. But this kind of poep/fart/kick-in-the-balls genre doesn’t appeal. It isn’t the kind of comedy I want to write and it isn’t the kind of comedy I want to watch. That isn’t to say that I don’t enjoy a good fart joke, and I was reared on the slapstick of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Chaplin. However, it’s a gross injustice to compare the masters of silent comedy with the witless pratfalls of Adam Sandler et al.
Consequently, I usually find myself on the ‘hipster’ side of the comedy equation – championing TV shows and movies that are critically acclaimed but commercially tangential. I devour brilliant series such as Community, 30 Rock, The Thick of It and Parks and Recreation, while I eschew chart-topping rubbish like 2 and Half Men. That’s just the way I’m wired.
Now, in a normal unregulated media environment such as they enjoy in America or Britain, that wouldn’t be a problem. There are enough broadcasters and movie studios to ensure that at least a few niche products get the green light each year. The fate of these left-field endeavours then rests in the hands of the audiences, and that is how it should be.
Unfortunately, I work and live in South Africa where there is a virtual monopoly on media production. We have the Big 5 broadcasters and a handful of viable movie producers – none of whom have the capital or courage to take a risk. As a result, our South African movies and TV shows are pitched at the broadest possible audience, usually based on a format that proven popular in previous iterations. And preferably with boobs.
That means our local audiences are fed a constant stream of lowest-common-denominator pabulum; a vague and derivative mixture of toothless sitcoms and juvenile comedies. There are occasional exceptions: Jozi and Material, both directed by Craig Freimond, were pretty good and at least tried to take things to the next level. But, by and large, we are still very much stuck in the 1980s – creating disposable comedy that would make Tony Danza look cutting edge.
It’s therefore no surprise that a market fed exclusively on porridge has never developed a taste for sushi or a nice meta-curry. And that leads, as is always the case, back to me…
I guess the thing that really gets me is that, under the current dispensation, there just isn’t a place for me in South Africa (either as a writer or an audience member). I have never made it all the way through a Leon Schuster movie. I can’t watch more than a couple of episodes of any local sitcom. I shun local movies at the cinema (because they are either kak comedies or self-righteous dramas). And this means that I am forced to consume all my media from overseas; hooking into the global media establishment while simultaneous isolating myself in a bubble of internationalism.
In other words, when it comes to English-language programming, I have to concede that I am utterly disconnected from the local market. I steadfastly believe that a shot to the nuts is only funny in a home video, and I’ve finally come to accept that this kind of ‘sophistication’ makes me the worst thing I could ever be: irrelevant.

"Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri has launched Al Zubarah, the first of four vessels in the class to be built for the Qatar Emiri Navy.
The launch took place at Fincantieri’s shipyard in Muggiano, La Spezia, after the construction officially started in July 2018.
In addition to the corvettes, the Italian shipbuilder will also build a landing platform dock and two offshore patrol vessels under a 4 billion euro contract signed in 2016.
Leonardo-Finmeccanica and MBDA were also part of the contract and will be responsible for the supply of the new naval units’ combat systems.
Leonardo-Finmeccanica will deliver main radars and on-board sensors and defense sub-systems, including 76/62 medium caliber and 30mm small caliber weapon systems, an anti-torpedo protection system and the Thesan mine avoidance sonar which is installed at the bow of the surface units.
MBDA will be responsible for delivering missile systems for the ships, which, according to the vertical launch cells seen on an illustration of the Al Zubarah shared by Fincantieri, could include Exocet missiles. MBDA is also delivering coastal defense systems to Qatar under a separate contract.

"Due to technological advances, DVDs and DVD players have become more important in many households. In order to store these DVDs and players, housings and other storage options were built especially for them. The DVD storage unit provides a convenient storage location. There are many different media storage solutions to meet the increasing demand for such devices. People who have a collection of DVDs need such solutions to store them in an organized way. Choosing a media storage solution can be a challenging task.
Tips for choosing the right DVD storage solution
Multimedia types: Select the different types of multimedia that you want to store in the memory. Media storage solutions are available in the form of stands and racks. Then decide whether you need a free-standing or a wall-mounted solution.
Storage size: Depending on the number of media you want to save, the size can be selected accordingly. Media storage solutions are available in various sizes and designs. Space in the room should also be considered before deciding on storage.
Functions: Check the functions of the DVD memory. It should be convenient and flexible to store and remove the media as needed. Check the number of shelves, racks, doors, etc. and other features.
Pay attention to the following functions of DVD storage solutions
- The shelves should be adjustable shelves to keep the media within reach.
- Some stores may have pull-out compartments that can be practical.
- The DVD memory should be stable and durable.
- You should have glass doors to protect the media
The breakfast table is an important piece of furniture and must be selected with extensive research. When you buy it for the first time, the number of options, sizes, materials, types, etc. can be very confusing. We have compiled a list of the most important tips to help you make a better decision.
Size - The first thing you need to consider is the size of the space you have for the breakfast bar table. It should be large enough to easily accommodate plates and food for everyone sitting on the table. A large table can look uncomfortable and take up a lot of space, while using a small table is not uncomfortable. Therefore, depending on the available space in the room, you have to make a selection.
Style - There are many different styles of breakfast tables available in the market. The traditional style with stool is generally preferred by most buyers. However, if you are looking for something modern, you can opt for glass tables with upholstered chairs. If you want a large group of people to sit on the table, you can opt for a country-style breakfast table with large benches.
The last thing you need to consider is the material of the breakfast bar table. Hardwood tables are the most common choice because they can also be sealed to improve protection and they are also extremely durable. If you are looking for a contemporary look, you can opt for metal or glass tables.
Don't fall for cheap offers, as you will usually pay a lot more in the long run. Search through several options and stores before making a purchase to get the best value for money.

"The video clip here leaves supporters of health care reform breathless, while the these spineless politicians now appear surprised by the public reaction. You don't use words like ""preference"" and ""not essential"" if you truly believe in something. USA Today:
Robert Gibbs told reporters this morning.""The preference is the public option."" Gibbs denounced reports that the administration may drop its support for a publicly funded insurance option because of intense opposition. He attributed the reports to a media ""overreaction"" after the comment by Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that a public option is not ""essential"" to a health care plan.
Obama himself stoked commentary with his statement Saturday that ""the public option, whether we have it or we don't have it, is not the entirety of health care reform.""

"Are you tired of spending money on over-the-counter teeth whitening treatments that don’t work?

Improper use of bleaching products can damage the enamel of your teeth. Another reason to choose professional teeth whitening service near you is to help preserve your tooth’s health. They use the products more than recommended to see increased whiteness.

"In 2010, the world was rocked over and over again as confidential diplomatic cables from the US government were leaked to the press and the world at large. Behind it all was a man named Julian Assange and the organization that he started for this express purpose, Wikileaks (an organization that publishes information from whistleblowers who wish to stay anonymous). Since then, Wikileaks has continued its mission even as Assange has been hounded by governments from both Europe and the United States of America. This comes from two sexual assault allegations and at least allegation of rape that occurred in Sweden that has had Assange on the run and hiding out.
For the past few years, Assange has been locked away and hiding out in the Ecuadorian embassy in the United Kingdom due to the lack of an extradition treaty between the two countries. He has been holed up and unable to leave due to the fact that he would immediately be arrested by the police that have been watching the embassy waiting for that very occurrence to happen. The UK police have been staking out the embassy since Assange took refuge there and have cost taxpayers millions of pounds since it started.
Now a UN panel is expected to rule that Assange has been arbitrarily held captive in the embassy and recommend that he be freed. While the panel isn’t legally binding, it will certainly put pressure on the Swedish government, the UK government, and the EU as a whole when it comes to this manner. Assange first complained to the UN about his arbitrary detention in the embassy in 2014 due to the fact that he couldn’t leave since he would be arrested. The UN’s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is going to announce its verdict on Friday but all signs point to them siding with Assange. That being said, Assange has also announced that he will be leaving the embassy regardless of the verdict and will accept arrest if that is what is going to happen due to the fact that he feels that there are no more courses for appeal.

"Is Hyperhidrosis Genetic?
We have compiled the findings from some key studies dedicated to analyzing the link between genetics and hyperhidrosis and here is what they found:
- A 2010 study determined that 34.1% of patients had a family history of hyperhidrosis.
- A 2009 study titled Analysis of family history of palmoplantar hyperhidrosis in Japan found that 36% of patients had a positive family history of hyperhidrosis.
- A family history of hyperhidrosis was found in 45% of patients in a study conducted by Lima et al. in 2015.
- 50.2% of patients had a family history of hyperhidrosis in a 2009 study conducted by Karimian-Teherani et al.
- 62% of patients reported that they had a family history in a 2003 study titled Primary hyperhidrosis: Evidence for autosomal dominant inheritance.
- A 2002 study titled Palmar hyperhidrosis: evidence of genetic transmission determined that 65% of their patient sample had a positive family history of palmar hyperhidrosis.
This is just one of the potential causes of hyperhidrosis, and the root cause is still obscure, and more research must be conducted. Thankfully, hyperhidrosis is a benign non-life-threatening condition and while it can have a severe impact on an individual’s quality of life, with particularly negative effects on their social and occupational life. Thankfully, effective treatment for the condition exists. So while we may not understand what causes it, at least we can manage its effects!
Palmar, plantar, and axillary hyperhidrosis are the most common forms of the condition. These are otherwise known as excessive sweating of the hands, feet, and underarms. Dermadry has created an all-in-one solution to treat all three problem zones from the comfort of your home. Our device uses iontophoresis technology, which works by directing a mild current through the skin to neutralize the connection between the nerves and sweat glands. Best of all, it is a non-invasive, all-natural, drug-free, and needle-free solution for those who suffer from sweaty hands, feet, and underarms.
Tip: If you suffer from hyperhidrosis yourself, take the opportunity to ask your close ones (parents, siblings, etc.) to see if they also suffer from the condition. Hyperhidrosis is seldom talked about and many feel embarrassed talking about their condition, but spreading awareness is crucial, and the best place to start is by asking those closest to you. It may even help you better understand your condition and create a support system!

Let the powerful autumn winds help you clear the energies and release all that no longer serves you.
We will share a technique with you here today – for those of you, who have been feeling anxious to take this next step – even though they feel a strong inner pull to do so. We have found this to be very powerful as a permission slip for shifting to a more preferred reality.
Whatever it is you feel you’d like to get resolved; simply picture yourself beyond that challenging situation. Truly see yourself, as if you had already encountered it and by now, it has been fully integrated. Just say out loud to yourself – or repeat in your mind: “I have this new job” or “I spoke to this person that I used to have a conflict with – and it wasn’t easy – but I did it!” or just “I am beyond that now”.
Make sure you keep on breathing, even more so: pick the type of breath that you believe ‘goes with’ the thought you chose to focus on. So in case of the earlier examples given; perhaps a sigh of relief, together with a relaxing of the shoulder-muscles, or change in posture all together. Allow your entire body to play along with this game.
To further enhance the impact of this practice; envision some playful details that make your visualization more lively, like: “While I drove to the office to ask about that new function, I looked out of my car window and I spotted a flock of sparrows dancing in the sky. This made me smile.” Or: “The moment I signed up for that new education-program that I’ve been dreaming of doing for years now – my favorite song suddenly started playing on the radio!” (look the song up – and start dancing to it ;))
None of this needs to actually have happened ‘yet’, you can just make it up and then play it out. Think out of the box. Allow silly things to flow trough your story-line, just to lighten up the entire idea you’ve decided to focus on. Almost nothing helps you find your center as effectively and quickly as laughter does.
You have often made many of your challenges seem so rigid, mainly because you weren’t taught how to play with them more. Adding funny or endearing details, helps ‘melt’ away this rigidity, and brings in fluidity, so circumstances can re-manifest in a more positive form into your world. Many of you will find, that especially these fun little details, though they seem irrelevant or silly at first perhaps – will often be the ones to be projected ‘back to you’ in synchronicities first, as you start playing this game.
We recommend to play with this tool no more then once or twice a day and only for up to 5 minutes. If your mind begins to drift – just allow it to do so, this simply means you’ve gone past the time you needed to use your full focus. Then just allow your entire visualization to evaporate and literally forget all about it. Go on your daily business. Play the game again (and perhaps on another subject) only when it truly feels in the flow. Sometimes playing it once or up to 3 times for one subject is already enough for circumstances to begin shifting towards the positive end of the spectrum.
We wish you so so so much fun with all of this – and we look forward to sharing with you again – in yet another Here and Now.”
With radiant and absolutely unconditional LOVE,

A non-invasive way to collect urine output for mobile women
DUO Go consists of a collection wand with absorbent material that clips onto a user’s underwear. The device should be placed snug against the user. When urine is collected in the wand, a pump suctions it away though the tubing to a drainage bag. The pump only turns on when it is triggered by the moisture sensor. The device has a battery life that lasts an entire day of wear, giving the user peace of mind that their urine incontinence will be managed discreetly. After urine is sucked away from the collection wand it is stored for disposal at the user’s convenience.",<urn:uuid:c289c427-136f-48c8-85e7-3e716abbddf3>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://designgarden.bme.gatech.edu/s21-project-duo/,2024-02-20T23:03:15Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9179715514183044,170,1.055387258529663,1
"Did you know that Puerto Rico, officially known as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States? And did you also know that it’s home to some pretty amazing scenery, including rain forests and bioluminescent bays? If you didn’t, then now you do! In addition to its natural beauty, there are many interesting facts about Puerto Rico that may surprise you.
For example, did you know that…
Puerto Ricans have their own designated seat in the United States Congress?
The official languages of Puerto Rico are Spanish and English?
And San Juan is the oldest city in the Americas?
There’s so much more to learn about this fascinating island. So read on for more fun facts!
1. What’s In a Name?
In 1493, Christopher Columbus arrived on the Island of Enchantment and called it San Juan Bautista. The island’s name then became Puerto Rico, meaning “rich port”, because its rivers and streams had gold. The capital city was then named San Juan.
2. Size Matters
Located east of the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico is only 3,515 square miles or 9,104 square kilometers.
3. Highest and Lowest Points
The highest point is Cerro de Punta which is said to have “the best view in all of Puerto Rico.” It stands at 1,338 meters or 4,390 feet above sea level.
The lowest point is the Caribbean Sea at sea level.
4. U.S. Citizenship
Yes, Puerto Ricans are American citizens! This is made possible through the Jones-Shafroth Act of 1917, which passed almost two decades after the Spanish-American War. Still, the island’s inhabitants also have Puerto Rican citizenship.
5. Not Just an Island
Believe it or not, there are 143 smaller islands, islets, and cays in Puerto Rico. Plus, these islands have the most beautiful beaches in the world!
6. Government and Sovereignty
Despite being a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico has its own government and sovereignty. This also means that they can’t vote in the U.S. Presidential Elections. However, the head of state is still the POTUS. The governor, who is the head of government, and legislators serve four-year terms.
7. Passport or Visa Requirements?
Interestingly, US citizens don’t need a passport or visa to travel to PR. In fact, the territory is a perfect destination for lawyers and attorneys to complete their CLE requirements thanks to Destination CLEs and the ease of travel to this island. With the Eduvacation℠ of Destination CLEs, you can relax on your well-earned vacation on top of receiving 14 CLE credit hours in beautiful Puerto Rico! Click here to learn more.
8. USD All the Way!
There’s no need to worry about having to exchange your U.S. dollars in Puerto Rico. Talk about convenience!
9. Taínos History
Did you know the Taíno or Taino Indians were the Arawak indigenous people who lived in the Caribbean and Florida? The Classic Taíno population was the group of people who inhabited the islands of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. However, when the Spaniards came, the Taíno became nearly extinct because they didn’t have immunity to the infectious diseases brought over during colonization.
10. The Only Tropical Rainforest in the U.S.
El Yunque National Forest is home to an impressive 183 animal species and 240 plant species, respectively. If you enjoy natural wonders, you’ll definitely love the hiking trails and waterfalls in this magnificent rainforest.
Puerto Rico has a tropical climate with a dry and rainy season. From late June to November, you can expect natural hazards like hurricanes, while December to May typically has the dry season.
12. Beach, Please!
Of course, the island is filled with beautiful sandy beaches, including an iconic beach that hosts heavily-graffitied military tanks. Flamenco Beach houses these tanks right alongside its turquoise waters and fine white sands.
13. Extremely Tall
You can find the tallest statue in the Americas in PR. Called “Birth of the New World,” it’s more than twice as tall as the Statue of Liberty in New York City. It stands at 360 feet, or 110 meters. The statue was a tribute to Columbus.
14. A Trip to the Caverns
Puerto Rico also has the biggest cave system in the Western Hemisphere. The Caverns of Rio Camuy is an impressive cave network stretching for 268 acres. If you’re the outdoorsy type, you’ll love covering the mapped trails, subterranean waterfalls, and deep canyons here.
15. Going Into the Deep
The Puerto Rico Trench found in the north Atlantic Ocean is the deepest point of the ocean. The depths reach over 8,400 meters, or over 27,500 feet!
16. Bright Lights
For one of the most spectacular sights you’ll ever see, we suggest venturing to Lajas, Fajardo, or Vieques Island to find three of the world’s four bioluminescent bays. Plus, Mosquito Bay in Vieques Island is a Guinness Record holder for being the brightest bio bay in the world. La Parguera in Lajas allows you to swim in the waters, while Laguna Grande in Fajardo has night kayaking tours.
17. First Nuclear Plant
The Caribbean’s first nuclear plant can be found in Puerto Rico. However, it only serves as a museum today.
18. Forbidden Island
The small uninhabited island called Desecheo Island is forbidden because it was used as a testing field by the U.S. Navy during World War II until 1952, and today it still has explosive equipment present. It’s located northeast of Mona Island, and it became a tropical marine reserve in 2000.
This strange island also has an endangered cacti species called higo chumbo (Harrisia portoricensis).
19. More Uninhabited Islands
Caja de Muertos, Gilligans Island, Isla Palomino, and Cayo Caracoles are just a few of the other uninhabited islands in Puerto Rico. Visitors can stroll along the shore, but there might be other restrictions.
The Cathedral of Rum which houses Casa BACARDÍ, Bacardí Family Museum, Bacardí Distillery, and Bacardí Pavilion, is the largest rum distillery in the world. Plus, Casa BACARDÍ Special Reserve is an exclusive blend found only in Puerto Rico.
21. If You Like Piña Coladas…
Although coconuts aren’t indigenous to the island, this tree was introduced in 1542 during the Spanish colonization and have grown in Puerto Rico since. The locals quickly incorporated coconuts into their diet and even invented piña colada in the process! Today, this PR national drink is a favorite all over the world!
22. Old San Juan’s Grandest
Catedral de San Juan Bautista is the second oldest structure in the Americas. It also houses the remains of Juan Ponce de León, who’s known to be the first governor of Puerto Rico and led the first European expedition to Florida. He died in Havana in 1521.
23. Cobblestone Streets
Old San Juan also has the original cobblestones that date back to when PR was still a colony of Spain. These are not your typical cobblestones, though. Instead, these stones have a greyish-blue tinge because of iron slag.
24. Pirate Robin Hood
Roberto Cofresí is a well-known pirate from this island. He used to attack ships and distribute the loot to the poor while he was actively pirating in the early 1800’s. The name Mosquito Bay also came from a small ship owned by this pirate Robin Hood.
25. Livin’ la Vida Loca
Who doesn’t love Ricky Martin? Maybe the younger generation wouldn’t know him right away, but even Gen Z would be able to recognize his iconic Latin pop songs. This singer-songwriter is just one of the many famous Puerto Ricans who dominated the world of celebrities. Other notable people with Puerto Rican ancestry include Rita Moreno, Michelle Rodriguez, Lin-Manuel Miranda, José Ferrer, Carmelo Anthony, Bruno Mars, and Benicio del Toro, among others.
All in all, Puerto Rico is an amazing place with a rich culture and history. If you’re looking for a vacation destination that offers something unique and exciting, look no further than Puerto Rico!

"Let’s face it, no matter how much you try to educate yourself on everything about your car, there is always a secret cleaning technique or wonder product that will surprise you.
Car cleaning tips and tricks develop as car owners and professional auto detailers alike learn from their past mistakes and improve on old cleaning methods. At the same time, new products and technologies are being developed everyday to help make your vehicle look as if it just rolled out of the showroom.
Which of These Car Detailing Tips and Tricks Are New to You?
- Talcum powder can take out the stain on your leather car seats. Worried about that ugly ink stain on your precious leather car seat? Don’t worry, a little dusting of talcum powder can help you get rid of it. Allow the powder to sit overnight for maximum effect, then carefully blot it away in the morning.
- Clean your car in the shade. You can avoid leaving swirl marks on your paintjob if you let your car dry naturally out of the sun. This is especially helpful if you’re going to apply wax after cleaning your car’s exterior.
- Cornstarch helps in buffing polish. Cornstarch will pick up excess polish or wax that can otherwise stick on the vehicle’s exterior and attract dirt quickly. Nobody wants a car that’s shiny in some places but pockmarked with dirty, sticky globs of wax and dirt in other places.
- Use newspaper for cleaning window glass. Those discarded newspapers in the trunk of your car can be helpful in removing the dirt streaks on your windshield. You can use your favorite window cleaning product, or concoct your own solution using vinegar diluted in water. Don’t forget to include your windshield wipers in the process, as they tend to spread dirt if not cleaned properly.
- Wash your car on gravel or a grassy lawn. To help get rid of the dirty runoff from your wash job, it’s best to park your car where there aren’t storm drains nearby. This way, you can avoid polluting your local water resources inadvertently. That’s one more way for you to help in the water conservation efforts in your area.
- Always keep a box of wet wipes in your glove compartment. Car owners forget that the best time to get rid of a spill or a stain is when it’s still fresh. A box of wet wipes is very handy for emergency clean-ups, so you won’t have to wait until the stain has set in before you work on it.
- Use a backseat organizer. An organizer will help you keep track of all the small objects in your car, from sharp scissors that can poke into the seats to candy wrappers to juice boxes. Knowing where to find these things can help you put them away before you park your car for the night, minimizing the possibility of causing further damage or mess to your vehicle.",<urn:uuid:16c06804-7d77-4cd6-ab81-a0316094b333>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://detailxperts.com/top-7-car-cleaning-tips-and-tricks-you-have-probably-not-heard-before/,2024-02-20T22:08:28Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9471407532691956,606,1.4199731349945068,1
"A creative capital: how the creative industries are transforming London for the better
Dr Diana Beech, Chief Executive Officer at London Higher talks about the importance of London’s creative higher education provision to London and its local communities.
London is a global city, London is a diverse city and, above all, London is a creative city.
In 2019, the London arts sector generated £58bn for the national economy. One in every six jobs in the city were supported by the creative industries, and London’s cultural offerings helped to attract four out of five tourists to the capital.
While the Covid-19 pandemic has undoubtedly been challenging for London’s arts scene, the creative industries are clearly being looked to, to revive the capital’s economy and to help get London back on its feet.
One of the first initiatives of the recently re-elected Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has been to launch the “Let’s Do London” campaign, intended to promote the UK capital as a major cultural hotspot and increase visitor footfall.
Underlying this campaign is the recognition that the creative industries are not only a crucial part of the engine behind London’s economy, but they are also what brings people back together again after more than a year of social distancing and isolation.
As a capital city with more than forty universities and higher education institutions in its midst, many of which offer high-quality courses in the creative disciplines, London has a strong pipeline of creative talent to lead the city’s recovery.
As a recent report by BIG South London member Kingston University London reveals, creativity is one of the top ten future skills that businesses consider important to protect the UK’s competitiveness, alongside problem-solving, communication and critical thinking. Nurturing London’s creative higher education provision will therefore be vital not just to the city’s future success, but to the productivity and prosperity of the nation as a whole.
As our own London Higher report released on 15 June shows, London’s students enrolled on creative higher education courses are also proving a much-needed boost to local communities – from re-imagining towns and local areas to supporting residents’ physical and mental health and wellbeing.
In south-west London in particular, the University of Roehampton holds partnerships with a wide range of arts organisations, including Wimbledon BookFest, Battersea Arts Centre and Barnes Children’s Literature Festival. The University’s involvement in these organisations and activities helps them to run and deliver tangible benefits to local residents and schools. It also provides these projects with capacity and skills from students and staff, thereby strengthening their resources and widening their reach.
Kingston University London is equally using its strengths in the creative arts for community benefit. The University has recently played a leading role in delivering and commissioning a public realm strategy, entitled “Re-imagining Kingston Town Centre’s Streets and Spaces”. The project, in partnership with Kingston First, the Greater London Authority and Kingston Council, is helping to transform the town centre by inspiring change and coordinating investment. Since its publication in late 2019, the strategy has been adopted by Kingston Council as policy and is being used by the town planners, showing how students’ creativity is enhancing the vibrancy and inclusivity of local spaces.
In short, creativity is what makes London and its local communities tick. It is already at the heart of civic regeneration efforts and, as attentions increasingly turn to post-pandemic recovery, we can expect creative skills to be at the heart of even more initiatives in the capital to build back better.
This is why we, at London Higher, are calling on national policymakers to recognise urgently the transformative power of the creative industries and steer clear of implementing policies that overlook the importance of creative disciplines and put at risk the UK’s future pipeline of creative talent.
As part of this, we are also calling on the Mayor of London in his new term in office to highlight the significance of London’s creative industries both to local community cohesion and to national economic growth – including making links to other regions of the UK where businesses and industry are reliant on London’s creative talent base.
Now is the time to put London’s creative higher education centre stage and recognise its leading role in rebuilding our capital and the nation for the future.
Not only do we need London to retain its creative capital, but the nation also needs London to remain a creative capital.",<urn:uuid:6658b600-22f2-402c-9b98-8c3829633f00>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://dev.big-knowledge.co.uk/news/a-creative-capital-how-the-creative-industries-are-transforming-london-for-the-better/,2024-02-20T21:38:21Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9513557553291321,929,1.8560289144515991,2

"This section covers installation methods for NDB Cluster on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. While the next few sections refer to a Linux operating system, the instructions and procedures given there should be easily adaptable to other supported Unix-like platforms. For manual installation and setup instructions specific to Windows systems, see Section 3.2, “Installing NDB Cluster on Windows”.
Each NDB Cluster host computer must have the correct executable programs installed. A host running an SQL node must have installed on it a MySQL Server binary (mysqld). Management nodes require the management server daemon (ndb_mgmd); data nodes require the data node daemon (ndbd or ndbmtd). It is not necessary to install the MySQL Server binary on management node hosts and data node hosts. It is recommended that you also install the management client (ndb_mgm) on the management server host.
Installation of NDB Cluster on Linux can be done using precompiled binaries from Oracle (downloaded as a .tar.gz archive), with RPM packages (also available from Oracle), or from source code. All three of these installation methods are described in the section that follow.
Regardless of the method used, it is still necessary following installation of the NDB Cluster binaries to create configuration files for all cluster nodes, before you can start the cluster.

Something Awful gores indie's sacred cows, i.e., Joy Division, The Smiths, Pavement and My Bloody Valentine. (via Graham)
Everyone who considers themself a hipster should take note: name-dropping Pavement isn't going to win you any merit badges in my scout troop. You'd be a fool not to see that even the bands that everyone loves are just as terrible as the bands that everyone makes fun of. The only difference between Nickelback and The Smiths is that Smiths fans dress slightly better and don't beat their girlfriends as hard.
I hypothesize that if Ian Curtis had continued to live and exert his gothic influence over the band, they would have eventually sounded like Siouxie and the Banshees except with a terrible singer. I also hypothesize that Ian Curtis would now be fat.
They're dead-on about Loveless, btw:
Its one of those rare albums that really sounds like the album cover looks: its an indecipherable blur of noise and distorted guitars. It boggles the mind that so many goofy hipsters are so in love with an album with so little to offer. All of the songs sound basically the same, and you really have to pay attention to figure out where one ends and the next begins. The lyrics are so incomprehensible that they might as well not even be there at all. Although there are certainly noises on this album that have never been made before or since, none of them are particularly interesting noises. In most cases, its the sound of several guitars playing a couple of chords with a few layers of grinding and feedback in the background. Sure, it probably took quite a bit of time and money to make those sounds, but are they particularly interesting? No, not really; when its all put together, it just sounds like a waterfall of sludge running through your speakers.

"Monkeypox: it’s the public who’s being stigmatised
The woke set fears the people, and their alleged homophobic prejudice, far more than the disease.
The current monkeypox outbreak has generated a very strange, but telling, response among the right-thinking crowd.
Back in May, when monkeypox cases began to emerge in Europe, achingly woke activists and social-media warriors seemed particularly exercised by how the outbreak was being reported. They were concerned that there was too much focus on the fact that this disease, which is normally confined to parts of central and west Africa, had suddenly spread almost entirely among gay men. Three events and venues in particular were being singled out as ‘superspreader’ moments – a gay sauna in Madrid, a 10-day gay pride event in the Canary Islands and a five-day fetish festival in Belgium.
The hackles of the right-on were raised almost immediately. As far as the NGO-cracy and assorted pundits were concerned, we were witnessing nothing less than a re-run of the AIDS pandemic during the 1980s, whereby the spread of a nasty (if thankfully not as lethal) disease was once again being blamed on gay men. Reports mentioning the sexual orientation of the overwhelming majority of those infected were said to be encouraging homophobia.
One activist, predictably invoking AIDS, warned about what happens ‘when gay men start being scapegoated as vectors of disease’. Another complained about what he called the ‘gay-plague messaging about monkeypox’.
NGOs were drawing similarly ominous analogies with the 1980s. The executive director of UK charity Aidsmap said the news reporting had ‘stirred memories of the early days of the HIV epidemic’, and that the media had been propagating ‘lazy, homophobic tropes’. Stonewall joined in too, with Sasha Misra, its communications director, condemning the ‘increasingly sensationalist media coverage’, which was inviting the public ‘to make the link between the disease and the LGBTQ+ community’.
Even the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) felt the need to intervene. Towards the end of May it claimed that while ‘a significant proportion’ of recent monkeypox cases had been identified among gay, bisexual and other ‘men who have sex with men’, some media portrayals of the outbreak were reinforcing ‘homophobic stereotypes’ and exacerbating ‘stigma’.
Fast forward to today, with monkeypox having been declared a ‘global health emergency’ by the World Health Organisation at the weekend, and the same voices have performed a remarkable volte-face. Before they were complaining that there was too much focus on the sexual orientation of those infected – now they are complaining that there is not enough.
One activist, writing in the Guardian, has now declared that we must ‘make sure we don’t scar another generation of marginalised men by turning a blind eye as disease ravages their communities’. A prominent Guardian columnist has echoed such sentiments, tweeting that ‘the current monkeypox outbreak overwhelmingly affects men who have sex with men… it’s not homophobia to speak the truth about this’. And WHO director-general Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus has urged all countries ‘to work closely with communities of men who have sex with men, to design and deliver effective information and services, and to adopt measures that protect both the health, human rights and dignity of affected communities’.
At first glance nothing of this makes sense. A couple of months ago, to speak of what many of those infected have in common was supposedly a product of homophobia, reminiscent of the reaction to the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s. Now the opposite is the case – to ignore what many of those infected have in common is now supposedly a product of homophobia, reminiscent of the complacent response to the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s.
It looks like a severe bout of cognitive dissonance among the pundit class, right-on activists and NGOs. Or at least it does until you consider what unites the two positions. And that’s the fear that underpins both seemingly contradictory accusations. A fear not of a threat to public health so much as a fear of the public. A fear of people’s alleged bigotry, their assumed homophobia and their indifference to the suffering of those who deviate from the norm.
So at first, it was assumed that the public, upon hearing about a disease spreading among homosexual men, would revert to anti-gay scapegoating type. And so we had those pre-emptive commentaries attacking the coverage of the monkeypox outbreak for supposedly encouraging homophobia. But then, with the outbreak still spreading two months on and now affecting over 16,000 people worldwide, the vast majority of whom are ‘men who have sex with men’, the same voices have performed a u-turn. Now they fear that the public – and public-health bodies – won’t focus enough attention, not to mention services and treatment, on the specific networks of gay men that are clearly most at risk. Because of their homophobia, their willingness to ‘turn a blind eye as disease ravages [gay] communities’.
It is as maddening as it is insulting. From the outset, the only people that talked about monkeypox being called a ‘gay disease’ or a ‘gay plague’, let alone a punishment from God and such like, were those attacking the public for its putative homophobia. Nobody outside the woke bubble thought anything of sort. They simply recognised the truth of what the news reports, not to mention epidemiologists, were telling them. That monkeypox is a disease that spreads through close, mainly skin-to-skin contact – or to be more precise, through contact with respiratory droplets and vesicle fluid encountered on bodies or textiles. And that, through sheer ill fortune, this virus is now in circulation among certain groups of people that happen to engage in close, skin-to-skin contact with multiple others. Monkeypox is not a judgement on the behaviour of ‘men who have sex with men’. It is not a reason for shaming or stigmatisation. It is simply bad luck.
Fortunately, the version of monkeypox currently doing the rounds is thought to be the milder west African variant. The overwhelming majority of those infected will make a full recovery. And given its transmission depends on close physical contact, its spread is likely to be self-limiting.
So it’s time to stop stigmatising and shaming the public, and focus on delivering help and advice to those who need it.

"Actor, activist, author, and educator John Leguizamo loves that his comedy makes people feel angry. In his 2018 one-man Broadway show, Latin History for Morons (now available on Netflix), the 55-year-old star splices raunchy jokes with history about the genocide of Native American people, his experience being racially profiled, and a welter of statistics about the underrepresentation of Latinx people in American media. Born in Colombia and raised in Queens, New York, Leguizamo grew up seeing negative portrayals of Latinx people in Hollywood and in the pages of the New York Times. This feeling of being an outsider, of not belonging, was a power that he eventually came to value—and harness as fuel for his comedy and acting career.
In January, Leguizamo sat down with Mother Jones’s DC Bureau Chief David Corn onstage at the Comedy Cellar, the historic New York City stand-up venue, to talk about his work, his ego, his process, and his favorite subject: Latinx history.
Corn’s interview with Leguizamo is one of several notable guests featured over the next three episodes on the Mother Jones Podcast—a special summer series with a very “2020” origin story. Earlier this year, the coronavirus pandemic stalled work on a new podcast, co-produced by Mother Jones and the Comedy Cellar, but not before three fascinating guests joined Corn for in-depth interviews about art, politics, comedy, and the philosophies that infuse their work. These chats were too good to simply shelve; in the coming week’s you’ll also hear from music icon Debbie Harry, and talkshow host Samantha Bee.
Listen to the full interview with John Leguizamo on the Mother Jones Podcast:
A transcript of Corn’s interview with Leguizamo is below, edited for length and clarity.
David Corn: In October 2016 you were working to register Latinx voters. You said Trump was good for Latinos because he was bringing together a group of people, people from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Venezuela, in the Dominican Republic, who hadn’t always seen themselves as part of a larger unified community. Well, what happened?
John Leguizamo: He’s a horrible human being who does a lot of horrible things, but he’s so horribly blatant about it that he galvanizes us. We were asleep at the helm, bro. All of us—white liberals, moderate Republicans, independents, Latin activists, black activists. He got us woke. We are in a moral correction right now in our society, trying to make everything right because he does everything so wrong.
I was never as political as I am since he was elected. I went to Florida, stumped for Hillary. I went to Vegas, stumped for Hillary. I’ve never done that for anybody. I went to Florida and I flipped the seat that was red for 30 years in Hialeah, a Republican city. We flipped that blue. Beto and I tried to flip Texas because we believed we could flip it with Maria Teresa Kumar. Texas is 40 percent Latin, 12 percent black. It should be a blue state, but for gerrymandering, voter suppression, and all the horrible things. This is a democracy! How do you make it so difficult for people to vote? Maria Teresa Kumar, she and her lawyers came up with a way around that is called VoterPal. We have to be so clever now and so active. It’s not a spectator sport anymore, being an American, you have to throw your hat into the ring now.
In your book Pimps, Hos, Playa Hatas, and All the Rest of My Hollywood Friends: My Life, you noticed that you felt like a second class citizen in the United States. And then 14 years later in Latin History for Morons you say the same thing. And I was just wondering if there’s been any change, any progress, or do you look at it a different way?
Look at these facts: We Latinx people are the second oldest ethnic group in America after Native Americans, with the largest ethnic group in America after white people. Where are we? What are our percentages of success? Less than one percent of government officials. Less than three percent of the faces in front of the camera in Hollywood or behind the camera. Less than one percent of the stories in the New York Times, New York Magazine, New Yorker or any other rag that has the city’s name on its banner, when we’re equal to whites in population in New York City. We’re 40 percent of the population in Texas and less than seven percent of the government officials. That’s not okay. That’s not alright. That’s cultural apartheid. I’m living in a cultural apartheid. It’s demoralizing. It’s demeaning. It’s painful. And you have to fight this with yourself. You have to build yourself up every day before you leave your house. To be able to confront all this, these micro aggressions, upon you daily.
With all your success, do you still feel this?
Yeah, of course. It’s hard to get rid of. I see it happening. New York City has three of the best gold standard public schools in the country: Bronx science, Brooklyn Tech, and Stuyvesant. It’s supposed to be the schools that help the poorest children in New York City make it. Less than five percent of those children are Latin. Why is that? How is that? that should not be happening. That outrages me. How can I feel okay with all my success and fame, and this is happening to kids that look just like me? That’s not okay.
You’ve been very critical about Hollywood, where you make your make a lot of money, for not casting Latinx people in a positive role, but even more importantly, not having them in the decision making positions.
Well that’s where I find that the problem is. [Los Angeles] is 50 percent Latino, and less than three percent of the faces in front of the camera or behind the camera are Latinx. That’s cultural apartheid. It’s like we don’t exist. How is that possible? It’s not for lack of talent. It’s not for lack of trying. It’s that executives don’t see our stories. They don’t see us. They don’t understand us. I’ve been trying to sell scripts for the last 30 years of my life. It’s been impossible. The movie I just did, Critical Thinking, is a true story about five Latin and black kids in the ghetto-est ghetto Miami who became United States chess champions in 1989. It was impossible to get it done. I had raised the money myself. And it was a brilliant story. But dude, it’s hard without Latin execs.
Now isn’t there a market imperative? The accelerated growth of the Latinx population in the United States, doesn’t that get them thinking, hey, we’ve got an audience out there?
We’re 25 percent of the US box office. We added $2.3 trillion to the US economy. If we Latin people had our own country, we’d be the eighth largest country in the world, the second largest state in America. They know that, but until you have a Latin executive who understands us, who sees us, until you have editors at the New York Times who live in our culture and appreciate our culture, where are you going to get the better stories about Latin people? Who knows that Prince Royce sold out Yankee Stadium twice, two nights in a row. No white or Black artists or any other artists in America has done that. Why isn’t that in the New York Times? Why isn’t it in the New York Times that we Latinx people have the 10 top hits internationally in the world in music today? Where’s that a big feature in the New York Times or New York magazine? That’s crazy. I got more facts. I got more shit to say. I ain’t done yet. An hour may not be enough.
I did watch Latin History for Morons, and you talk a lot about the conquest of the Americas by the Spaniards and what you call the “Great Extermination.” You can give us statistics because they are absolutely overwhelming. We all know how many people perished in the Holocaust. We
don’t really talk about the numbers of Native Americans, let alone indigenous people throughout North America and South America. And I wonder why you think the terminology, calling this the Great Extermination, why it hasn’t been more widely used and accepted?
Because once you start acknowledging the oppression, the exploitation of Latinx people and Native Americans, once you start accepting that this country was stolen, it’s hard for people to live with that. It’s hard for people to accept that because then you feel like you have to do something about it—reparations and whatnot. And and when you knew that there were 100 million Native American people in North, Central, and South America, and then 95 percent of them vanished through disease brought in by the Europeans, extermination, mutilation…. I mean, all kinds of horrors. Columbus was a horrible, horrible human being. He raped nine year old Taíno girls and bragged about them in his journals.
Tell us who the Taínos were. I have to say I learned a lot from Latin History for Morons. There was some elemental facts about the history of our culture that I forgot. And to think about these stunning gaps in our collective ignorance.
I love that. That’s the name of my next show, “Collective Ignorance.”
So can you talk about the Taínos?
There were 3 million Caribbean Native Americans under the under the Arawaks, and Taínos was was a branch of them. They were in Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti). And they were completely exterminated. Except a lot of my friends who did their DNA from Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Dominican Republic found that they have like 5/10/20 percent Native American, so it’s got to be Taíno. So that’s the beauty of knowing that their DNA is that we know they still they’re still alive, somehow, you know.
Yeah but basically it was a whole people completely wiped out.
Yeah it’s called the Caribbean Holocaust.
Now I have to say Latin History for Morons is pretty funny.
I know, it’s hard to believe that it’s a funny show!
We’re talking about genocide, extermination here, but I don’t want to give anyone the wrong impression.
But dude, that’s what my comedy has always been about. And that’s what my fight with American comedy was. It was like it never really captured life the way I grew up. I grew up laughing and in pain and oppressed and racially profiled but I still laughed, I still enjoy my life, and that’s what I tried to bring to American comedy through all my work.
What do you think resonates most with the audience? I mean, I’m sure every audience is different. But you’ve been doing this for over a year now longer. Can you tell from the stage what has truly connected?
There are moments of like raw honesty, of expressing the angst of what it’s like being Latinx in America still. I feel like I have to defend myself all the time. Sometimes you feel like everything is against you. And then the audience gets so quiet. I can hear sometimes people sniffling and quietly trying not to cry. I hear that in those incredible moments of silence. We sit there as if we were in church, and we meditate on that, and then I start doing some other crazy things. I wanted to show people that our history and knowledge of it can be weaponized, that it’s a call to action, that we need to spread this information. We got to get it into American history textbooks. We got to get it out there. There has to be that Ken Burns documentary on it. There has to be that Spielberg inclusion of our contributions to World War One and World War Two, because they’re massive.
We fought in every single war America’s ever had. I’m talking about the American Revolutionary War, where 10,000 unknown Latino patriots fought. Cuban women in Virginia sold their jewelry to feed the Patriots. [Bernardo de] Gálvez gave $70,000 worth of weapons to George Washington. He was General in Louisiana. He had a misfit army, like the Mets of armies. His blockade, with 3000 Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Mexican, Native Americans, and freed slaves, blockaded the British from the south. So they couldn’t surround the Patriots from the south and ambush them. Cuba gave over $200,000 worth of contribution donations to the American patriots.
Now we know about Lafayette, but where’s the Mel Gibson movie about this?
Right. I know it’ll be up to me and and Latinx executives that we get into power.
There’s a moment in Latin History for Morons where you say something like, if we were placed back in the history books, can you imagine how America would see us? How we we would see ourselves? You keep coming back to the way your culture internalizes the way it’s portrayed in the mainstream culture, right?
Or the lack of seeing yourself. Equally the negative images that Hollywood puts out about us, or New York Times just reporting the negative without equally putting positive. If you don’t see yourself positively or see yourself at all, the unspoken message is you’re not worth it. You’re not worthy. You’re not going to make it. And that’s what gets imprinted on the kids.
You can’t be what you can’t see.
Yeah, how can you project yourself into the future without seeing yourself in someone else in the past? Who looked like you, spoke like you, and had success? How do you, as a young person, build your self esteem? How do you build your self worth? I mean, your parents can try, but if society is saying the opposite, it’s a it’s a tough internal battle for Latinx kids and youth.
How did you do it?
I had a lot of mentors. I had a ton of therapy. I’m still in therapy. I’m still working on it. You know, it was rough. It was hard, man. I was a very troubled youth for all those reasons. High school forced me to go to therapy, thank God. And and that saved me. I started looking at myself in my life in America and I always felt like an outsider. And now I started to value my outsiderness, my sort of lack of placement in this society. It gave me some kind of power.
I really enjoy comedy. I always have. And I wonder what it is that makes something funny. And there are people like you who’ve made a career on being able to make others laugh or think something is funny. And I wonder to what degree do you think about how that process works: why do we find things funny? How can you as performer do something, say something that makes us laugh, and how often do you think something’s going to be funny that actually isn’t?
I still think shit that I say is funny, even though people don’t laugh. I still think it’s funny. It’s funny to me, that’s good enough for me. Laughter is just life’s greatest mechanism to keep us going, it’s the best thing ever. I’ve always had to be funny because to keep bullies from beating me up, from my dad beating me up. Funny was a thing that helped me through life. I still love it, it still keeps me going. Comedy is a science in a lot of ways.
When did you know you were funny?
I guess when I was like 13 and 14 because I would make people laugh and that’s how we would hang. All of us would be trying to crack each other up, all day, all night. I always tried to hang out with the people who love to groove like that, to vibe like that. We would just make each other laugh.
In the book, you basically call yourself an asshole a lot. You say actors are not human beings. Work is everything. We’re not really fit to cohabitate with other people. And I was wondering how true is that? Is that a shtick? Is there something about performers that make them more difficult?
Yeah, I mean, have you ever hung out with actors? It’s hard. They’re beautiful. But, especially the successful ones, there’s a level of narcissism that sometimes it’s hard to get through. You don’t make it to this level without a healthy dose of narcissism. And sometimes that’s a lot to put up with. My poor wife and my kids have to deal with it. I do like to talk about myself a lot. I do like to do voices and I like to, you know, sometimes steal all the attention. It’s just a natural thing that you’ve been sort of groomed for, but sometimes it’s too much.
You said not too long ago that American movies are so shallow. Do you think that’s still the case or do you think the rise of all these streaming networks, which produce so much content now, movies and unlimited series which are basically long movies…
Well it’s flip-flopped, right? Back in in the ’70s, which was the golden age of American cinema, and those were some great masterpieces of writing, of auteurship. Easy Rider, Harold and Maude, M*A*S*H, Annie Hall, Godfathers, Mean Street, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Apocalypse Now, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Last Detail, Five Easy Pieces. It was masterpieces after masterpieces. So many great, great films. And then, not so great. Then American cinema became very much about the blockbuster, about getting butts in seats. It was no longer about the artists’ storytelling. And it’s getting worse and worse. I don’t really go to the movies anymore. Independent film is suffering. But, now TV is the place you go. Streamers and television are where the greatest writing, the the greatest acting, the greatest storytelling is happening now.",<urn:uuid:b3f19514-d03f-487f-ba72-21d8200c5696>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://develop.motherjones.com/politics/2020/07/john-leguizamo-trump-jokes-whitewashing-latinx-history-podcast/,2024-02-20T21:59:56Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9706350564956665,4042,1.7431365251541138,2

Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) Overheating
The three main components responsible for heating up your phone are the system-on-chip (SoC), the battery, and the screen.
It is normal for a phone to generate some heat, but how can you tell if it is overheating?
One way to determine if your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) is overheating is by placing the phone against your ear and cheeks, just as you would during a phone call. If it feels uncomfortably hot, it is overheating.
To fix overheating issues when using the device normally, do the following:
Fix Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) Overheating under Normal Use
If your phone only heats up while charging, skip to the next section.
Often, a processor and a bright screen pushing to maximum capacity are the primary causes of a smartphone heating up. Your phone gets hot when it uses the processor excessively.
To maintain optimal temperature on your phone and avoid overheating, your phone’s heat passes to the screen, dissipating the heat into the air and your hand.
The ideal solution to overheating and other issues is installing a firmware update. Manufacturers often release firmware updates that solve overheating and other problems. Hence, make sure to check for and download any available updates.
Sometimes, several firmware updates need to be installed sequentially. Therefore, ensure you’ve installed all available updates to solve your phone’s overheating issues.
Tips to Address Heating Problems in Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro)
Heating issues are common while performing certain activities on your smartphone.
However, some measures can help reduce overheating. Read on for tips after each activity to minimize this problem.
While gaming, your phone may heat up, which is quite normal. Try to take short breaks to allow your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) to cool down.
Avoiding bulky cases as a thicker case does not necessarily mean better fall protection. A mobile case with thicker corners could offer the best protection instead.
Always download apps from reputable developers and install them via the Play Store. Choose to update apps regularly to fix bugs and minimize overheating issues.
Extended Video Recording
Extended video recording periods can cause your phone to overheat and drain the phone battery quickly. Using the camera with the flash on can make the situation worse. So, it’s best to turn off the flash when it isn’t needed.
Running Resource-Hungry Tasks
Activities such as gaming, video editing, WiFi-Hotspot, screen mirroring, and streaming require more resources than others. Prudent use of these features can minimize overheating problems.
How to Fix Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) Overheating While Charging
Your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) may often heat up during charging due to the power provided by the charger. Fast chargers can even supply up to 240W of power!. Here are some tips to fix overheating during charging:
Updating the firmware of your smartphone is crucial as it can effectively resolve various issues. So, check for available updates and install them promptly and regularly.
This practice ensures your device operates smoothly and benefits from the latest improvements and bug fixes.
Remove Your Case
Removing the case from your phone can indeed help with heat dissipation. Cases, especially those made of non-breathable materials, can trap heat, potentially leading to overheating due to improper ventilation.
Heat can dissipate more effectively by removing the case, reducing the risk of thermal damage to the device’s components.
Using an original or compatible charger can significantly reduce overheating problems.
Reputable brands and smartphone-certified chargers precisely deliver the correct voltage and current.
Using unauthorized chargers can lead to higher voltage fluctuations, causing excessive heat generation and potentially damaging your device.
Don’t Game While Charging
All smartphones naturally generate heat when charged due to the electrical current flowing through them. However, playing games on a charging phone can intensify this heat production.
To prevent potential overheating and maintain the health of your device, it is advisable to refrain from gaming when your phone is charging.
Charge in a Cool Environment
Charging your phone in a cool environment is crucial for its battery health. High temperatures accelerate the degradation of lithium-ion batteries, leading to reduced capacity and shorter lifespan.
Exposure to direct sunlight or hot car interiors can cause the battery temperature to rise rapidly, impacting its performance and longevity.
Disable Fast Charging
Turning off fast charging can be helpful to mitigate overheating issues in smartphones. Fast charging generates more heat, which can strain the device’s battery and components.
Additionally, using older chargers with lower power output reduces the charging speed, allowing the device to cool down during charging.
If these tips do not help, consider visiting an authorized service center for diagnosis and repairs.
Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) Screen Issues: How to Fix Them
One potential issue when utilizing the Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) is a malfunctioning screen.
The screen serves as a fundamental aspect of smartphones, which implies that if it’s not operating efficiently, it could pose a significant issue.
Encountering a non-functional screen could be one of the most undesirable problems one could experience when using a brand-new device.
Below, I have provided some tips to help you troubleshoot and fix the most common screen issues.
Fix Screen Issues on the Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro)
Multiple factors can cause screen malfunctions. Use the following tips to address the issue at hand.
Restarting your phone is a basic troubleshooting step that can resolve numerous phone software-related issues.

When a phone screen is dirty, it can hinder touchscreen performance and negatively impact the user experience.
Dirt, dust, oil, grease, and liquid spills are common culprits. To clean your screen effectively, use a soft cloth.
It is essential to avoid using alcohol or other chemicals as they can potentially damage the oleophobic coating on the screen, which helps repel fingerprints and smudges.
By using a gentle cloth and avoiding harsh chemicals, you can maintain the cleanliness and functionality of your phone screen.
Screen protectors are essential accessories for mobile devices, as they shield delicate screens from scratches and damage.
However, screen protectors can wear out or damage over time, reducing touch responsiveness.
Replace worn-out or damaged screen protectors with new ones for optimal touch sensitivity.
Power Saving Mode
Your phone’s performance may be affected if the power-saving mode is enabled. This feature throttles down your device to conserve battery life.
Go to your phone’s settings and enable power-saving mode.
Note that this mode may be disabled automatically once your battery level reaches 15% or above.
Accidentally exposing your phone or device to water can cause water damage inside the screen and other components.
If you suspect your phone has been exposed to water, take these steps:
- Turn off your phone immediately.
- Put your phone in a bag of rice for at least 24 hours.

However, it is crucial to note that this method is not foolproof and may only sometimes be effective.
So, if it fails, seeking professional assistance from an authorized service center is the recommended course of action to ensure proper and thorough repair of water-damaged phones.
A damaged screen is one of the most common causes of an unresponsive screen. Check your phone for signs of cracks, dents, or discoloration.
Remove the case (if any) and scrutinize it under sunlight. Replace your phone’s screen if you spot any physical damage, such as cracks or dents.
I recommend bringing your phone to an authorized service center to get it fixed by a professional.
Authorized service centers have skilled technicians who can replace the screen with genuine parts, ensuring optimal performance and preserving your phone’s warranty. Avoid attempting DIY repairs, as it may void the warranty and further damage your device.
So, with these tips, you can troubleshoot and fix most screen issues on your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro). If the problem persists, contact Xiaomi support for assistance.
Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro): Solutions for Slow or Laggy User Interface
People often complain about the slow user interface on the Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro), which is a significant issue. Laggy UI causes the animations to stutter, and opening apps or performing any task on the phone becomes tiresome due to longer processing time.
Laggy UI can deteriorate the overall experience of the phone and make it difficult to use.
At times, the screen freezes, further frustrating the users.
Therefore, if you encounter any form of sluggish user interface on your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro), you can try the following solutions.
Fix Laggy UI in Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro)
Low Storage Space
Insufficient storage space is a common issue that can significantly impact a device’s performance. When storage is running low, several problems may arise.
Firstly, data corruption becomes more likely as the device struggles to allocate space for new files or updates. Secondly, low storage can force the operating system to delete unused apps or clear app caches, resulting in a slower user interface.
Additionally, limited storage hinders the device’s ability to smoothly run background processes and system updates. To alleviate this issue, it is advisable to uninstall unused third-party apps and transfer media files to an external device, such as a computer or cloud storage, to free up space and improve overall device performance.
Random Access Memory, abbreviated as RAM, is the device’s primary memory responsible for storing apps, documents, and media files like music, videos, photos, etc., for seamless accessibility.
The capacity of your phone’s RAM determines its multitasking ability. Presently, phones feature RAMs ranging from 1GB to 18 GB. However, most devices possess only 4 to 8GB of RAM, which may not suffice if several apps are open simultaneously.
Uninstalling redundant applications is an effective strategy to reduce RAM consumption. Installing more apps occupies more space, leaving less RAM capacity for the operating system to function correctly.
You can further optimize RAM usage by installing light versions of apps like Facebook Lite, Messenger Lite, Twitter Lite, and YouTube, among others.
Older versions of Android devices are susceptible to poor RAM management, making upgrading to the latest firmware essential.
A malware-infected phone can significantly affect its speed and performance. You can detect a potential malware attack via a virus scanner.
Several reliable and efficient virus scanner apps are available in the market. It would be best to use one of them to scan your phone and eliminate any malware slowing your device’s speed.
Outdated hardware can significantly impact the performance of a device, leading to UI lags. As technology advances, newer applications and phone software updates require more processing power and memory.
It can be sluggish if an old phone needs more resources to handle these demands. The ageing components, such as the processor and RAM, may need help to keep up with the increased workload, causing delays and lags in the user interface.
In such cases, upgrading to a new phone with more capable hardware becomes necessary to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
Following these solutions can solve the laggy user interface issue and improve your overall experience on your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro).
Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) Battery Drains Quickly: Tips to Fix it
Is your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) battery draining too fast? Several factors can contribute to the battery draining quickly, including minor firmware issues, app usage, or hardware issues such as a weak battery.
Tips to Fix Your Phone’s Poor Battery Life
Adjust Screen Brightness
High screen brightness is a major culprit in battery drain. If you frequently stream videos or browse the internet, your screen will consume much battery power. You should check your phone’s screen brightness settings and lower them if necessary.
Your phone can automatically adjust its brightness with the “Adaptive Brightness” feature. To enable it, go to Settings > Display > Brightness and turn on “Adaptive Brightness/Auto Brightness.”
Turn off WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS
Operating your mobile device’s WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS depletes the battery quickly. This is because these particular functionalities consume a lot of energy. Furthermore, numerous applications in your phone utilize these features for synchronizing and interacting with external devices.
Enabling these functions on your device increases the chances of reducing the battery life cycle. Therefore, it is essential to turn these features OFF when not in use and enable them ON only when necessary.
Buggy Firmware and Battery Life
After updating the Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) firmware, the phone’s battery life may be affected due to bugs in the new software. Sometimes, manufacturers release Android updates without fixing all the bugs.
To fix these bugs, a firmware upgrade or downgrade might be necessary. To upgrade the firmware, ensure you have the latest version available on your phone and update it if it’s not. If an update is unavailable, try factory resetting the phone.
If the issue persists, a firmware downgrade may be required, but it is not recommended to do it yourself as it can be complicated. Instead, visit an Authorised Service Center for support.
Old Battery and Battery Replacement
If your phone happens to be two or more years old, consider replacing its battery. Research conducted by Battery University has revealed that battery capacity decreases as much as 22% battery percentage in the first year of use.
As your device ages, battery-related issues will likely arise. Consequently, if your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) is over two years old, it’s probably best to replace the battery.
While it is possible to replace the battery yourself, it’s not necessarily an easy task. As such, I recommend replacing the battery with an authorized service center.
Apps and Battery Drainage
Regarding fast battery drain or battery consumption, the apps on your phone may also be the culprit, similar to the firmware. I recommend that it’s best to stick to downloading and installing apps exclusively from the Google Play Store.
Removing apps such as phone Cleaner App, RAM Booster App, Battery Booster App, Antivirus App, Mod Apps, and other ordinary apps is suggested. These apps don’t simply decrease your phone’s speed; they might even make it freeze or shut down!
Gaming and Screen Mirroring Tips
The processor consumes a considerable amount of resources while gaming. Despite being idle most of the time, it operates entirely during gameplay.
When using screen mirroring, monitoring your device’s battery usage is crucial. Avoid continuous screen mirroring to prevent draining your battery needlessly. Instead, opt for the “Handheld” mode, mirroring only the part of the screen you need.
If problems persist, such as sudden battery depletion, it could be attributed to hardware issues. Therefore, it is crucial to seek the assistance of an authorized service center for proper diagnosis.
Challenges with Cellular Network and Mobile Data on Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro)
The cellular network is an integral aspect of any smartphone. When it doesn’t function correctly, it can pose a significant challenge for the users. A lot of Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) users experience problems with their cellular network.
If you use a weak cellular network service, your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) might not maintain a steady connection or transmit data. This issue can lead to challenges with mobile data and call reception.
Solutions to Cellular Network & Mobile Data on Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro)
Fortunately, some simple fixes can remedy the situation, and listed below are some practical solutions to help.
Use Flight mode
This simple yet effective solution can fix your network issue.
Flight mode, or airplane mode, is a feature in mobile devices that disables all wireless connections, including Cellular and Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth.
By enabling Flight mode and then turning it off after a few minutes, you can often resolve phone network-related issues and restore normal functionality to your device.
To do this, Go to Notification Panel > Turn ON Airoplane mode for a few seconds, and Turn OFF.
Restart your device
If you’re still facing network issues even after trying Flight mode, a simple solution to consider is restarting your smartphone.
Restarting can help restore proper network connectivity and resolve any temporary glitches or conflicts that may be causing the problem.
If this also fails, then move to the next one.
Check daily bandwidth usage
I want to make a point for our Indian readers that exclusively applies to them. Indians receive a daily amount of maximum data transfer capability. Once you use this amount, your internet speed will reduce to 64 Kbps.
To avoid inconvenience, kindly ensure that your mobile data plan is active and that you have stayed within the daily bandwidth limit.
If you are experiencing minor connection issues with your mobile device, such as no network connection or problems with calls and texts, a straightforward solution is to remove and reinsert the SIM card. This action helps ensure proper contact and alignment, often resolving common connectivity problems.
Enable Data Roaming
To enable Data Roaming, open the Settings app on your device. Find the “Cellular” or “Mobile Data” section and look for the option to enable Data Roaming. Enabling this feature allows your device to connect to cellular networks while travelling abroad, ensuring you have access to mobile data services.
Mode of Network
The “Preferred network type” feature determines your device’s network mode. Mobile phones commonly offer multiple mobile networks, including 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G.
When you opt to use the 5G mode on your Android phone, and this network mode is unavailable in your current location, your phone will be unable to receive any proper signal. As a result, it is advisable to select the “Automatic” option.
Reset Network Settings
The name defines its task. Follow the simple steps mentioned below to reset the network settings.
1. Open the Settings app on your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro).
2. Scroll down and click on “System.”
3. Tap on “Reset options.”
4. Tap on “Reset WiFi, mobile, and Bluetooth.”
5. Tap on “Reset settings.”
If you can’t find “Reset options,” use the search button on the Settings app to look for it.
By employing these suggested solutions, you can troubleshoot cellular network connectivity issues and mobile data issues and get your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) back to a stable and reliable network connection.
None of the above measures worked?
Attempt installing the SIM card on a different phone. If the alternate device receives a signal, there is a problem with your phone’s SIM card slot.
If there isn’t any signal, the SIM card is damaged, or there is a cellular network problem in your region. Contact the Carrier to obtain a new SIM.
Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) Slow Charging: Possible Causes and Fixes
If your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) takes longer than usual to charge, there could be several reasons. Here are some factors that could be causing your slow charging issue and some tips on fixing them.
Fix Slow Charging on Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro)
One common reason for slow charging is using an incompatible charger. Check to make sure that the charger you are using is compatible with your phone.
Sometimes, a fast charger from a different brand may not work with your phone, leading to slow charging.
For instance, the Oneplus Nord(2020) can charge at 30W with the charger in the box, but using a 30W charger from MI will not charge Oneplus Nord at 30W.
If you’re using a compatible charger and your phone isn’t charging at high speed, it could be due to an improper connection.
Ensure that the charger is plugged into a socket correctly and that the USB cable connecting the charger and phone is firmly connected and not loose.
Sometimes, slow charging occurs when the phone does not detect all four contacts of the USB cable.
It is common for dust particles to accumulate inside the phone’s socket over time, and this can prevent fast charging.
To ensure all four contacts of the USB cable connect, use a non-conductive material such as a toothpick to clean out any dust in the phone’s socket.
Defective USB Cable
The cable is one of the most stressed components as it undergoes a lot of twisting, bending, and pulling, especially for earphones, headphones, and USB cables.
If you encounter slow charging issues with your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro), the problem could be a faulty USB cable because the wires within the USB cable tend to break, and the damage is not noticeable because of the cable’s outer covering.
To identify the problem, use another cable or borrow one from your friend. If the charging speed improves, you have found the culprit, and it’s time to purchase a new USB cable compatible with the charger.
However, please note that fast charging may only work with brand-issued cables.
For instance, if you use a 30W Oneplus charger and a Type C cable to charge Oneplus Nord, it will charge at normal speeds and won’t utilize the WRAP charging feature.
In most cases, the charger either works or does not, and slow charging is unlikely to occur due to a weakened charger.
However, electronics can sometimes malfunction, so trying a different charger to fix the issue is worth trying.
Overheating is another leading cause of slow charging. Although it’s normal for devices to heat a little during charging, if your phone gets too hot, the device’s software will reduce the charging speed to prevent it from overheating and catching fire.
Firmware issues causing slow charging
Slow charging on your phone could be an indication of buggy firmware. As the firmware manages various phone functions, it could result in problems such as slow charging.
To resolve firmware bugs, updating the firmware is essential. Navigate to the phone settings and initiate the update to fix any firmware issues.
In conclusion, slow charging issues on your Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) can occur for several reasons, such as using an incompatible charger, improper connection, and dust accumulation. Try the above tips to fix your slow charging issue.

In this guide, we will explore common solutions to help you overcome these challenges and get your apps working smoothly again.
Fix Apps Open Slowly on Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro)
A common issue with the Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) is slow app opening. This may be due to insufficient storage space in the internal memory, which is a prevalent cause.
It is advisable to leave 40% of the internal storage free. You can tackle this problem by:
– Uninstalling unused applications
– Deleting old media from WhatsApp
– Downloading and utilizing lite versions of applications from the Play Store
If none of the above work, a factory reset is the last resort to free up storage space.
Slow app openings on your phone may be due to insufficient free RAM for the operating system.
Uninstalling unnecessary apps and using the lite version available on the Play Store can help.

This problem is familiar with Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite (Redmi 6 Pro) and other Android smartphones. The following methods can resolve the issue.

Clear Play Store Cache

Clear Cache & App Data
Access your device’s Settings > Apps, find the app causing issues, remove its cache, and clear its app data.

"In today’s digital age, securing our sensitive data has become increasingly important. We store valuable information on our computers, from personal documents to corporate data, and safeguarding it from unauthorized access is paramount. One powerful tool designed to enhance data security is BitLocker. In this blog post, we will delve into what BitLocker is, how it works, and why it is a valuable asset for protecting your data.
What is BitLocker?
BitLocker, an integral part of Microsoft Windows operating systems, offers comprehensive disk encryption capabilities. Introduced with Windows Vista and available in subsequent versions, BitLocker provides a robust layer of protection for data stored on internal and external drives. Its primary purpose is to encrypt the entire contents of a drive, ensuring that even if the physical drive falls into the wrong hands, the data remains inaccessible without the proper authentication.
How does BitLocker work?
BitLocker utilizes a combination of software and hardware components to achieve its encryption capabilities. When enabled, it encrypts the entire operating system volume, including system files, user files, and temporary files, on a sector-by-sector basis. The encryption process converts the data into an unreadable format, rendering it useless without the decryption key.
To unlock the encrypted drive and gain access to the data, users must provide the correct authentication, such as a password, a smart card, or a USB key. The authentication process takes place during the system boot-up phase, ensuring that the drive is only accessible to authorized users.
BitLocker also supports various authentication modes, including TPM (Trusted Platform Module), which securely stores encryption keys, and TPM+PIN or TPM+USB configurations for enhanced security. Additionally, BitLocker can be managed and configured through Group Policy settings or the BitLocker Drive Encryption Control Panel.
Why use BitLocker?
- Enhanced Data Security: BitLocker’s strong encryption algorithms protect your data, safeguarding it from unauthorized access. Even if a drive is lost or stolen, the encryption ensures that the information remains secure.
- Seamless Integration: As a built-in feature of Windows operating systems, BitLocker seamlessly integrates with the Windows environment, providing a familiar user experience. Its compatibility with other Microsoft technologies simplifies implementation and management for organizations.
- Centralized Management: BitLocker offers centralized management capabilities, enabling system administrators to enforce encryption policies across an organization. This helps ensure consistent security practices and simplifies the recovery process in case of lost or forgotten encryption keys.
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Support: BitLocker leverages the security features of TPM, a hardware component embedded in many modern computers. TPM enhances encryption security by securely storing encryption keys and verifying the integrity of the system during boot-up.
BitLocker is a powerful disk encryption tool that provides an additional layer of security for your data. By encrypting the entire drive, it prevents unauthorized access to your files and protects sensitive information in case of device theft or loss. Its integration with Windows operating systems, centralized management capabilities, and support for TPM make it a valuable asset for individuals and organizations seeking to enhance data security. Consider utilizing BitLocker to keep your digital assets safe and secure in an increasingly connected world.",<urn:uuid:ba35c756-441d-4a07-89f0-bfa10c26ace8>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://devopspal.com/2023/06/an-introduction-to-bitlocker-securing-your-data/,2024-02-20T22:31:40Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.867268979549408,675,2.8476767539978027,3

"Its the end of an era, Microsoft have announced that the Xbox 360 Marketplace will close on July 29th, 2024. This means that it will no longer be possible to purchase games or DLC on the Xbox 360.
It is estimated that around 220 digital only games will disappear when the Xbox 360 Marketplace closes, presuming any games that are backwards compatible on the Xbox One / Series are still available to purchase on newer consoles.
Digiex has hosted a lot of Xbox 360 demos and arcade games for well over 15 years now, including some popular early releases before wide availability on Xbox Live, including the Resident Evil 5 Demo, Left 4 Dead Demo, and the Duke Nukem Forever Demo.

"- Scientists have detected phosphine in the clouds of Venus.
- Phosphine is a gas that can be produced by both biological and non-biological processes, but it is considered to be a potential biomarker for life.
- The researchers considered all possible explanations for the presence of phosphine on Venus, including both biological and non-biological sources.
- Biological processes are the most likely explanation for the presence of phosphine on Venus, but more research is needed to confirm.
- The discovery of phosphine on Venus is a significant step forward in the search for life beyond Earth.
Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and it is often called Earth’s twin because of its similar size and composition. However, Venus is a very different place from Earth. It has a dense atmosphere that is mostly made up of carbon dioxide, and the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead.
Because of its harsh environment, Venus has long been considered to be an unlikely place for life to exist. However, a new study published in the journal Nature Astronomy suggests that Venus may be home to aerial lifeforms that float in a thin slice of habitable atmosphere, surrounded by otherwise hellish conditions.
The study was led by Clara Sousa-Silva, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Sousa-Silva and her team used two different telescopes to detect phosphine in the clouds of Venus.
Phosphine is a colorless, flammable gas that has a garlic-like odor. It is produced by a variety of industrial processes, but it is also a byproduct of certain biological processes. On Earth, phosphine is produced by anaerobic bacteria, which are organisms that can live without oxygen.
Because of its association with life, phosphine is considered to be a potential biomarker for extraterrestrial life. A biomarker is a substance or characteristic that can be used to indicate the presence of life.
Sousa-Silva and her team considered all possible explanations for the presence of phosphine on Venus, including both biological and non-biological sources.
One non-biological source of phosphine is lightning. Lightning can produce phosphine through the interaction of nitrogen and phosphorus in the air. However, the researchers calculated that lightning could not produce enough phosphine to explain the amount that has been detected on Venus.
Another possible non-biological source of phosphine is volcanoes. Volcanoes can release phosphine into the atmosphere through the interaction of lava and water. However, the researchers found that there were not enough active volcanoes on Venus to produce the amount of phosphine that has been detected.
This leaves biological processes as the most likely explanation for the presence of phosphine on Venus. However, it is important to note that the detection of phosphine is not definitive proof of life. More research is needed to confirm that the phosphine on Venus is indeed produced by living organisms.
- Biological processes: Phosphine is produced by anaerobic bacteria on Earth, and it is possible that similar organisms exist in the clouds of Venus.
- Non-biological processes: Lightning and volcanoes can produce phosphine, but the researchers calculated that these processes could not produce enough phosphine to explain the amount that has been detected on Venus.
The discovery of phosphine on Venus is a significant step forward in the search for life beyond Earth. It suggests that life may be more common in the universe than we thought, and it raises the possibility that life can exist in even the most extreme environments.
More research is needed to confirm the source of the phosphine on Venus and to determine whether or not it is produced by living organisms. However, this discovery is a reminder that we are still so much we don’t know about our universe, and it gives us hope that we may not be alone.",<urn:uuid:c348ee71-2edb-486f-8423-115a16c7b280>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://digitimed.com/is-venus-hiding-aerial-aliens-in-its-clouds-mits-astonishing-new-discovery-unveiled/,2024-02-20T22:31:15Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9565741419792175,795,3.802525758743286,4

"The British team for the Motocross of Nations was unveiled and then two days later thrown into chaos with injuries to Ben Watson and Max Anstie.
Watson, who had been picked for the MX2 berth by Team Manager Mark Chamberlain, broke his wrist during warm-up for the MXGP of Italy and Anstie – who had the MX1 ride – was diagnosed at Imola with a partially collapsed and punctured left lung sustained a fortnight earlier at Lommel.
While Watson is definitely out, Anstie could recover in time to take his place alongside Shaun Simpson who will contest the Open class for Team GB but the injuries still represent a major headache for Chamberlain.
“Obviously it’s disappointing,” he said, “particularly for Ben because he’s definitely out and that’s a real shame for him but with Max there’s still a question mark so we need to look at that over the next couple of weeks.
“I spoke to Max on Sunday morning when he was still in hospital and he was in good spirits but he can’t fly for four weeks which rules him out of the GPs and they’ve got to constantly do scans to keep an eye on how it’s healing.
“If it heals when he is supposed to be in China then potentially he could be back on a bike but at this stage it’s too early to tell.”
Chamberlain refused to be drawn on possible replacements for Watson but he does have some breathing space and isn’t required to name his final selection until the Friday before the event at Assen in Holland on September 29.
“Losing any rider obviously makes things a lot more difficult but to potentially lose two in one weekend is a big blow,” he added. “I’m not going to rush into a decision straight away because we need to see how Max is and then look at how the other guys are getting on and then make a call.
“It’s the first time we’ve put a team out and the overall consensus was positive and then this happens!”

"This is a very long time wanted feature and really I don’t know why i didn’t posted yet. stupid.
Would be nice to have more option on the way GUI elements selection works.
if you drag into patch you select both nodes and links.
there could be a mode in which you can select just nodes.
The node selection mode could be activated by pressing a key during selection.
This feature is so useful when you want to delete some nodes in a patch where there are many links crossing behind without breaking everything.
so here is the new selection behavior to test in latest alphas:
- if nodes and links are in a selection only nodes are selected
- if only links are in a selection they are selected
- pressing ctrl selects both links and nodes (old default)
- pressing shift only selects links
bunch of nodes with connections;
if you repeat twice a selection (without deselecting by pressing mouse left in patch) , the second one seems to be influenced by the status of the previous
if the node is entirely or just partially inside the selection, seems to influence the bug behaviour.

"Disneyland Park was once home to four iconic mountains: Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, Matterhorn Bobsleds, and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. As Splash Mountain transforms into Tiana’s Bayou Adventure, guests say that two other Disneyland mountains aren’t operating fully.
Big Thunder Mountain Railroad
Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is located in Frontierland at Disneyland Park, Magic Kingdom Park, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Park (Paris). “Streak through a haunted gold mine aboard a speeding train on this thrilling coaster-style ride,” Disneyland Resort writes.
“Legend has it that after gold was discovered in the 1850s, eerie incidents took place in the mine. Trains would take off and race through tunnels… by themselves. As you enter the cursed cavern, your train speeds up along the rickety track. Shoot under a booming waterfall and dodge a falling boulder from an unexpected landslide as you swoop around sharp turns and drop into desolate canyons. On this rip-roaring adventure, you may learn that some legends turn out to be true…”
The Matterhorn Bobsleds attraction is exclusive to Fantasyland in Disneyland Park! “Hurtle through a snow-capped mountain on a speeding alpine sled while avoiding the clutches of the Abominable Snowman,” the official Disneyland Resort ride description reads.
“Climb into a 6-person bobsled and brace yourself against howling winds as you ascend 80 feet up into an icy cave. Take in the sweeping views at the summit and prepare for a thrilling, high-speed ride. Swoop in and out of shadowy caves and along jagged rocky ledges. Throttle through snowy chutes and around frozen precipices. Fly across bridges and under waterfalls before splashing down into an alpine lake. The real peril is not snow or sleet! Stories abound of a growling creature known as the Abominable Snowman—who will do anything and everything to protect his home. Do you have what it takes to find out if the legends are true?”
Disneyland Mountains Change
According to recent Disneyland Resort guests, water effects are missing on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Matterhorn Bobsleds.
“Noticed the water effects off for Thunder and Matterhorn,” u/Iggipolka wrote on Reddit on Friday. “Have they been on this week? Any idea why?”
Other Disney Parks guests confirmed issues with the special effects.
“For Matterhorn, if you’re referring to the waterfall, that was off over the weekend,” u/forlorn_hope28 replied. “Or at the least, it was running at just a trickle, enough to keep parts of the rock face damp, but not properly flowing.”
“For BTMRR, I noticed the water in the first lift hill was diverted to all the way to the left side,” they continued. “Not like normal where it flows from either side above the train, but literally to the left where I had never seen it before. In either case, no idea why they weren’t working properly, but just another addition to the list of things that aren’t at 100%.”

"Is there a way to detect that a sewer drain pipe has clogged and is in the process of backing up? I'm not looking for a) advice like ""don't put grease or tampons down the drain"" or b) here are some hints that things may not be right (like a gurgling toilet or strange smells). I've been Googling for products or techniques to know for sure that there's a clog but coming up with nothing.
I'm surprised in 2022 how primitive this is given how critical it is. A clog will essentially shut down your house until it's fixed but I can't find any way to know you're clogged until it's too late and you have sewage on your basement floor. In theory, even a sewage-proof webcam inside the pipe would be ok: I'd rather look at a pic of sewage once a day then have to clean it off the floor.
I know commercial septic systems have high-end monitoring gear. Anyone know of any way to do this for the residential market?

"OCI Artifacts Explained
The OCI (Open Containers Initiative) manages a few specifications and projects related to the storage, distribution, and execution of container images. If you’ve ever run a docker container, you’ve interacted with these specifications, whether you know it or not.
OCI registries are typically used for container images, but it’s actually possible (and even a good idea in some cases) to use them for storing and distributing other types of data. There are a couple techniques for doing this, and one of them is commonly referred to as “OCI Artifacts”. Even though they’re in relatively widespread usage, I’ve seen a lot of confusion recently around what an OCI Artifact actually is. Here’s my take:
OCI Artifacts are not a new specification, format, or API. They’re a set of somewhat-contradictory conventions for how to store things other than images inside an OCI registry.
This post explains what these conventions and contradictions are, why you might want to consider using them, and also explains some of the activity and proposals going on in the OCI right now.
What even is an OCI?
To fully understand what an OCI Artifact is, we first have to understand what an OCI image is. Let’s start with the confusing part — you’re probably not actually using OCI images! Yes, even if you run hundreds of thousands of containers pulled from an OCI-compliant registry into an OCI-compliant runtime, deployed across a thousand-node Kubernetes cluster, you’re probably not using OCI images. What? OK fine, this is a bit pedantic, but this entire blog post is pedantic. Let me explain.
First — Docker images and OCI images are only mostly the same thing. In the early days of the OCI, the most widespread container format was by far Docker. As vendors pushed for a neutral specification, reusing the Docker image manifest format made the most sense to start with. The only problem was that this format contained a bunch of hard- coded references to Docker the company.
The Docker manifest (known as Image Manifest 2 Schema Version 2) looks roughly like this:
If you’ve ever worked with Docker images, this should look pretty familiar. There’s some boilerplate at the top, a config
section, and a list of layers
. The OCI format could use it’s own blog post or series, so I won’t dive too far in here. The boilerplate is the important part to look at to understand what an OCI image is and why this isn’t one, specifically the mediaType
The first mediaType
field refers to the entire manifest. Here, we can see that it is set to application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json
with the docker
string still present. The OCI reserved some new mediaTypes
with IANA, those are:
If you’re paying close attention, you’ll see that there are only two mediaTypes
included here, but three earlier by Docker. I’ll explain that in a bit. Nothing else substantially changed in the format after the transition from Docker to OCI other than these strings.
Most registries added support for the new mediaTypes
over time, but tooling that wanted to remain portable needed to continue to support the old formats. This led to a cycle, which is still present somewhat today. Tooling worked fine so no one was begging for support for these new formats, meaning registries were slow to add support, meaning tooling continued to remain backward compatible with the old types, meaning you’re probably not actually using OCI images, you’re using Docker images.
So we now know what OCI images are, what are OCI Artifacts? The Artifacts initiative set out to make the registry format a bit more generic, to allow for users to store and distribute arbitrary files. We’ve already had blob storage and binary distribution systems for years, so why would we want to reuse a container format? Well, it turns out the container format has some really nice features that make it suitable for other environments (mostly the content addressable API).
It’s also widely supported by platform vendors, and finally happens to be the only real dependency to bring up a production Kubernetes environment. You need to host the k8s images themselves somewhere. While it is possible to run a registry in a Kubernetes cluster, that starts to bring in some chicken-and-egg problems.
So we have a pretty good API that’s widely supported and can reasonably be assumed to be available. Why not stick other things in here? Kubernetes-adjacent projects like Helm, TektonCD, OPA, and more started to pick up on this trend, allowing for configuration, charts and policy modules to be stored in an OCI registry. Other package managers followed suit too, like Homebrew and even WASM.
These other formats figured out ways to fit their data model into the OCI image manifest, mostly successfully. The manifest
gives you one config
blob and then a list of layer
blobs, but clients can choose to interpret these however they wish. Most seem to use just one layer
for all package data, but some make use of multiple.
Things mostly work out fine in this model, but if you have a single registry with different types of data inside of it, things can get confusing for clients. This is normally what mediaTypes
are for — you can indicate what type of data is contained in a blob. Clients read this before interpreting data and either accept or ignore the data they want. This works great for the layer fields, but the OCI image manifest does not actually allow users to set the manifest.mediaType
for the overall object.
Remember how we had three mediaTypes
in a docker image (one for the manifest, one for the config, and one for the layers), but OCI images only had two (one for the config and one for the layers)? This is due to backwards compatibility issues with older docker clients. The manifest.mediaType must either be the legacy docker one or unset. This means there’s no great place to indicate what is contained by the overall manifest, so most artifact types just don’t set this.
To try to improve on this model, the OCI Artifacts project set out to define some conventions here. They decided that the best place to indicate the type of the overall artifact would be the config.mediaType:
This isn’t ideal, but it’s the best option really available. That means a random artifact type might look like:
You can see that the config blob is set to a custom type to indicate the format for the entire object. That’s what an OCI artifact is! Something:
- other than an image
- stored in a registry
- that sets a custom type in the
Here’s the contradiction: not enough registries support this field for tooling to be able to rely on it. The OCI specification even recommends against using this if you care about portability:
Many registries still don’t even support OCI mediaTypes
at all, or have an allowlist preventing custom config.mediaType
values. This leads back to our circle of stale specifications — tools can’t rely on being able to set this field, so they just don’t. People either communicate information about what type of content is in each image out-of-band, or use other conventions/heuristics to figure out whether they understand how to work with the content of an image.
Tool authors can’t rely on this feature working, so they don’t technically use OCI Artifacts per the OCI definition, they just store arbitrary artifacts inside of OCI (or even Docker) manifests and work out how to fetch them some other way.
I hope this post explains things a bit more clearly. An OCI Artifact is not a new type, or a new specification registries and tools need to add support for. It’s a documented convention around how to use a specific field inside of a manifest to indicate what the manifest contains, that’s unfortunately not widely supported enough to be used yet. Some specifications rely on it (WASM, mostly), while the others don’t.
So what’s next? I do think that storing other things inside a registry is a great idea, and even maintain a bunch of tools that do this. I’d love to see some changes to the specification to make this easier. Requiring registries to allow other config.mediaTypes
might be one place to start. There are a few other proposals around completely new API versions floating around that seem useful. There are also some other proposed changes in flight around linking stored data together in ways not possible today.
These all seem great, but getting these rolled out widely enough to be useful to tooling will take years if it happens at the same pace as the last round of specification changes. Hopefully we can speed things up!",<urn:uuid:6eae41a3-7087-43b5-8a32-8cac0b8ac2a8>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://dlorenc.medium.com/oci-artifacts-explained-8f4a77945c13?source=author_recirc-----9b7b2a127473----0---------------------56481ed9_a40e_4ceb_85c9_5c63dcd966d2-------,2024-02-20T23:39:05Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9184831976890564,1942,2.250781774520874,2

The New Britannia
Big Government corrodes the integrity of a people, catastrophically.
The trick in this business is not to be right too early. A week ago I released my new book — the usual doom’n’gloom stuff — and, just as the sensible prudent moderate chaps were about to dismiss it as hysterical and alarmist, Standard & Poor’s went and downgraded the United States from its AAA rating for the first time in history. Obligingly enough they downgraded it to AA+, which happens to be the initials of my book: After America. Okay, there’s not a lot of “+” in that, but you can’t have everything.
But the news cycle moves on, and a day or two later, the news shows were filled with scenes of London ablaze, as gangs of feral youths trashed and looted their own neighborhoods. Several readers wrote to taunt me for not having anything to say on the London riots. As it happens, Chapter Five of my book is called “The New Britannia: The Depraved City.” You have to get up pretty early in the morning to beat me to Western civilization’s descent into barbarism. Anyone who’s read it will fully understand what’s happening on the streets of London. The downgrade and the riots are part of the same story: Big Government debauches not only a nation’s finances but its human capital, too.
As part of my promotional efforts, I chanced to find myself on a TV show the other day with an affable liberal who argued that what Obama needed to do was pass another trillion-dollar — or, better yet, multi-trillion — stimulus. I think not. The London rioters are the children of dependency, the progeny of Big Government: They have been marinated in “stimulus” their entire lives. There is literally nothing you can’t get Her Majesty’s Government to pay for. From page 205 of my book:
“A man of 21 with learning disabilities has been granted taxpayers’ money to fly to Amsterdam and have sex with a prostitute.”
Hey, why not? “He’s planning to do more than just have his end away,” explained his social worker. “Refusing to offer him this service would be a violation of his human rights.”
Why do they need a Dutch hooker? Just another hardworking foreigner doing the jobs Britons won’t do? Given the reputation of English womanhood, you’d have thought this would be the one gig that wouldn’t have to be outsourced overseas.
While the British Treasury is busy writing checks to Amsterdam prostitutes, one-fifth of children are raised in homes in which no adult works — in which the weekday ritual of rising, dressing, and leaving for gainful employment is entirely unknown. One tenth of the adult population has done not a day’s work since Tony Blair took office on May 1, 1997.
If you were born into such a household, you’ve been comprehensively “stimulated” into the dead-eyed zombies staggering about the streets this last week: pathetic inarticulate sub-humans unable even to grunt the minimal monosyllables to BBC interviewers desperate to appease their pathologies. C’mon, we’re not asking much: just a word or two about how it’s all the fault of government “cuts” like the leftie columnists argue. And yet even that is beyond these baying beasts. The great-grandparents of these brutes stood alone against a Fascist Europe in that dark year after the fall of France in 1940. Their grandparents were raised in one of the most peaceful and crime-free nations on the planet. Were those Englishmen of the mid-20th century to be magically transplanted to London today, they’d assume they were in some fantastical remote galaxy. If Charlton Heston was horrified to discover the Planet of the Apes was his own, Britons are beginning to realize that the remote desert island of Lord of the Flies is, in fact, located just off the coast of Europe in the north-east Atlantic. Within two generations of the Blitz and the Battle of Britain, a significant proportion of the once-free British people entrusted themselves to social rewiring by liberal compassionate Big Government and thereby rendered themselves paralytic and unemployable save for non-speaking parts in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. And even that would likely be too much like hard work.
Here’s another line from my book:
“In Britain, everything is policed except crime.”
Her Majesty’s cowed and craven politically correct constabulary stand around with their riot shields and Robocop gear as young rioters lob concrete through store windows to steal the electronic toys that provide their only non-narcotic or alcoholic amusement. I chanced to be in Piccadilly for the springtime riots when the police failed to stop the mob from smashing the windows of the Ritz and other upscale emporia, so it goes without saying that they wouldn’t lift a finger to protect less prestigious private property from thugs. Some of whom are as young as nine years old. And girls.
Yet a police force all but entirely useless when it comes to preventing crime or maintaining public order has time to police everything else. When Sam Brown observed en passant to a mounted policeman on Cornmarket Street in Oxford, “Do you know your horse is gay?”, he was surrounded within minutes by six officers and a fleet of patrol cars, handcuffed, tossed in the slammer overnight, and fined 80 pounds. Mr. Brown’s “homophobic comments,” explained a spokesmoron for Thames Valley Police, were “not only offensive to the policeman and his horse, but any members of the general public in the area.” The zealous crackdown on Sam Brown’s hippohomophobia has not been replicated in the present disturbances. Anyone who has so much as glanced at British policing policy over the last two decades would be hard pressed to argue which party on the streets of London, the thugs or the cops, is more irredeemably stupid.
This is the logical dead end of the Nanny State. When William Beveridge laid out his blueprint for the British welfare regime in 1942, his goal was the “abolition of want” to be accomplished by “co-operation between the State and the individual.” In attempting to insulate the citizenry from life’s vicissitudes, Sir William succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. As I write in my book: “Want has been all but abolished. Today, fewer and fewer Britons want to work, want to marry, want to raise children, want to lead a life of any purpose or dignity.” The United Kingdom has the highest drug use in Europe, the highest incidence of sexually transmitted disease, the highest number of single mothers, the highest abortion rate. Marriage is all but defunct, except for William and Kate, fellow toffs, upscale gays, and Muslims. From page 204:
“For Americans, the quickest way to understand modern Britain is to look at what LBJ’s Great Society did to the black family and imagine it applied to the general population”. I believe it is regarded as a sign of insanity to start quoting oneself, but at the risk of trying your patience I’ll try one more, because it’s the link between America’s downgraded debt and Britain’s downgraded citizenry:
“The evil of such a system is not the waste of money but the waste of people.”
Big Government means small citizens: It corrodes the integrity of a people, catastrophically. Within living memory, the city in flames on our TV screens every night governed a fifth of the earth’s surface and a quarter of its population. When you’re imperialists on that scale, there are bound to be a few mishaps along the way. But nothing the British Empire did to its subject peoples has been as total and catastrophic as what a post-great Britain did to its own.
There are lessons for all of us there.

"Semantic search is a fantastic technology, if used correctly. I am not talking about users of semantic search technology, I am talking about the technology vendors that make it part of a system
I was inspired to write this blog after reading Glen Cathey’s (The Boolean Black Belt) Article on Why Do So Many ATS Vendors Offer Poor Search Capability. The article made me think about search engines (google, yahoo, etc) and how semantic search is being used with them.
What is semantic search? To put is simple: semantic search can take, as input, a word like “Java” and offers up other related terms like “J2EE” or “Beans” (both are related to Java). This allows the user to type in a few terms but match many, many terms.
The matching terms are built into an “expert system” that is continually built over time. Many fancy names are given to these systems, based on how they are built, but basically they are sets of rules.
Semantic search is not AI (artificial intelligence). If you hear that, it probably started in a marketing department somewhere.
Companies that have built semantic search engines, while they have not created AI, have spent a tremendous amount of time and resources to build these sets of rules. The better engines can build rules on the fly from a new set of data, like resumes. This is very cool stuff.
Overall, I like semantic search. It has great potential, however, it has great weaknesses if used incorrectly. If built into the engine itself, semantic search can be very powerful, this is because semantic processing is done at the search engine side, without any limitations or constraints. However, if bolted onto a search engine, it can be more harmful than good.
Here is what I mean. I’ll try to keep my logic simple.
1. The Google search engine has a limit in how many terms can be submitted to it.
2. Semantic search, by it’s nature, creates permutations upon given terms. For example:
“Senior VP of Sales” can be “SVP Sales” or “Senior Vice President of Sales”
to translate that into a boolean expression you get
“senior vp of sales” OR “SVP sales” OR “senior vice president of sales”
3. After creating permutations upon several concepts, you are out of search terms.
I’m a big believe in laws (maybe not speed-limit laws), but more the “laws of the universe” type stuff. I like to understand and deconstruct the rules and see if each one stands alone, or, do I need to recheck my premises. In this spirit, just before the first sourceCon conference, I developed the Seven Laws of Internet Research. I felt there was too much emphasis on memorizing search strings and the latest search engines or sites, but not enough fundamental thought leadership on how to think about searching the Internet.
The first two laws are
1. The Law of Permutation
2. The Law of Completeness
The Law of Permutation simply states that when searching the Internet, as it is not a homogeneous source of data, you must describe what you are looking for in the language of the many vs. the language of the one. (YES, this is what Semantic search is doing).
The Law of Completeness states you must strive for completeness of search engine results in order to have the superior outcome
Big Question: What happens if semantic search is applied before you reach completeness of results?
Answer: Missing data. Competitors eat your lunch. If you are a sales person, it means missed sales leads, if you are a recruiter, it means missed resumes or passive candidates.
Does this mean that I am anti-semantic search? No way. I think it has great potential.
Here are my take-aways:
-Semantic search should be inside the search engine for optimal results
-Semantic search bolted onto a standard search engine is severely limited.
-Semantic search will cause data to be missed if applied before reaching completeness of possible results
-When combining a standard search engine and semantic search, it is best to apply the semantic processing AFTER completeness of data has been reached. In reality, this would not be semantic search, but semantic filtering.",<urn:uuid:f658538c-8f67-4064-b6db-bc5e5249f650>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://donatodiorio.com/tag/google/,2024-02-20T21:51:22Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9427379369735718,931,2.136065721511841,2
"Observers are keeping an eye on this year's ""Singles' Day"" or ""Double 11"" (双十一 shuāng shíyī), the massive online shopping festival that takes place every year around November 11th. Singles' Day was originally created by Jack Ma's Alibaba in 2009, which, along with Ant Group, were among the companies targeted by the Chinese government's Big Tech regulations this year. Wu Xiaolin and Ding Anhua believe that as criticisms of fintech firms have been increasing since 2020, it is important for China to remain rational and objective, cultivating a better understanding of the sector's innovation and development. Wu presents three key advantages of fintech firms. Firstly, they serve micro and small enterprises (小微企业 xiǎo wēi qǐyè), which are neglected by traditional financial institutions, at a lower cost. This inclusive service model contributes greatly to the development of China's real economy. Secondly, fintech companies have played a leadership role in meeting clients' needs and enhancing customer experience. They serve people who are ""unbanked"" (白户 bái hù) – those without accounts with banks or mobile money providers – which expands financial inclusion in the country. Thirdly, fintech companies are driving the digital transformation of the financial system. China is now leading the fintech sector globally, especially in mobile payment, consumer loans and credit, and digital wealth management. Fintech firms, however, have brought new challenges for policymakers, from platform monopolies, personal data mishandling, debt-fueled lifestyles to algorithmic bias. Furthermore, fintech firms could also pose new systemic risks to the financial system. Therefore, in order to mitigate these risks while still encouraging innovation, the authors recommend that China should implement ""macroprudential regulation.""
As of 13th November 2021, the Covid-19 pandemic has claimed over five million lives with over 252 million recorded cases worldwide. How China handled the pandemic remains an important issue domestically and internationally. Liu Wei and Liu Yuanwen focus on how China's grassroots governance played a big role in the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan in 2020. Even under normal conditions, grassroots neighborhood (社区 shèqū) and subdistrict (街道 jiēdào) communities have long faced the realities of heavy tasks, few resources, and little power. In the pandemic's aftermath, Wuhan demonstrated its ability to improve the efficiency of its administrative system, authority and responsibility structure, and grassroots mobilization, which allowed the city to accomplish extraordinary and difficult tasks. Regarding the first point, Wuhan continuously adjusted its administrative system as the epidemic developed: On January 20, 2020, the Wuhan Municipal Headquarters for COVID-19 Epidemic Prevention and Control (武汉疫情防控指挥部 wǔhàn yìqíng fáng kòng zhǐhuī bù) set up eight working groups, including emergency security, public communication, transportation, and medical treatment; on February 16, four new groups were established in Wuhan, including those responsible for hospital beds and the coordination with medical assistance teams from other regions; and on February 21, a new medical treatment group for non-new COVID-19 cases was set up. Secondly, Wuhan gradually improved its authority and responsibility structure. For example, a large number of Party cadres were sent down (下沉 xià chén) to the frontlines to fight the epidemic. However, due to the hierarchical administrative structure, grassroots staff were constrained in managing the more senior dispatched cadres, resulting in the confusion of having multiple leaders. In response, Wuhan decided to set up temporary Party branches and placed dispatched cadres under the command of community Party organizations. This reshaped organizational structure ensured that the tasks were efficiently executed. Finally, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee and municipal government published an open letter to CPC members encouraging cadres to play a leadership role in the process. Also, cadres at all levels from the discipline inspection and supervision organs were sent to oversee the work being done on the ground. The mobilization of the Party and its internal discipline made it possible for CPC members and cadres to be dispatched to the ground and fight the epidemic, considered the most important political mission. According to the authors, these factors led to the successful control and overcoming of the pandemic in Wuhan.
At the Glasgow climate summit, China has been the target of criticism, scapegoated for climate change. Wen Jiajun points out that a major reason behind the dramatic increase in China's carbon emissions is because it serves as the ""world's factory."" Developed countries relocate their manufacturing industries to developing countries, like China, and thereby externalize their carbon emissions and associated pollution. For example, 7 to 14 percent of China's carbon emissions come from producing goods for the US consumer market. With China producing goods for the world, the question of ""who really owns China's carbon emissions"" needs to be considered. At the same time, there is a huge geographic disparity between high-polluting countries and those affected by climate change. Wen points to the fact that in 2000, 28 percent of global carbon emissions came from North America, but only 0.09 percent from Central Africa, which has been experiencing severe climate-related disasters. Developed countries are home to only 20 percent of the world's population but account for 75 percent of the world's cumulative carbon emissions. The US is the largest cumulative and per-capita carbon emitter, yet it withdrew from all climate change agreements including Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, until February of this year. Despite being a victim of climate change like other developing countries, China has been fulfilling its emissions reduction commitments in recent years. It introduced the ""New Development Concept"" (新发展理念 xīn fāzhǎn lǐniàn) that proposes harmony between the natural enviroment and economic development, set the ""dual carbon"" peak and neutrality targets (双碳 shuāng tàn), and is developing new energy technologies and public transportation. According to Wen, although environmental NGOs have grown in recent years in China and improved public awareness, some of China's middle class still holds the US high-consumption lifestyle as a standard, while neglecting the climate catastrophes impacting vulnerable regions and populations in China. For example, the number of private car owners in China reached 244 million by the end of 2020, with an average annual increase of 13.6 percent over the past five years. Exploring the real possibilities of a low-carbon economy requires breaking away from the ""American dream"" aspiration and rethinking the type of development that China needs.
On November 6, Chinese e-sports team Edward Gaming (EDG) won the League of Legends (LoL) World Championship, which became an online sensation among millennials. Ma Zhonghong points out that although e-sports (电子竞技 diànzǐ jìngjì) – multiplayer video game competitions – was classified by the government as an official sport in 2003, it still carries the stigma of being a ""spiritual opium"" or an ""internet addiction"" targeting the country's young people. The classification has also been subject to great debate, with some arguing that e-sports is just ""competition"" or ""entertainment,"" while others believing that it is an ""intellectual"" sporting activity of the information age. Nevertheless, the e-sports industry has been developing rapidly. By 2020, the number of users reached 520 million and the market value exceeded US $15.6 billion. Ma found that e-sports players are mostly young men with middle-level education. For example, the average age of the 130 e-sports players in the LoL World Championship last year was 20.8 years old, and 82.3 percent were under 23 years old. Meanwhile, nearly half of the players have high school or technical secondary school (中专 zhōng zhuān) diplomas. The young age and relatively low level of education of these players, who are attracted by the industry's high salaries, have also raised public criticism. The average salary of China's 440,000 e-sports professional gamers exceeded US $1,720 per month in the first half of 2019, higher than the local average salary. Some well-known players can earn up to US $156,000 per year. In 2017, the Ministry of Education added ""electronic sports and management"" to the list of university majors, and 131 Chinese universities have offered degree programs so far. The author states that e-sports – as a new profession that appeals to youth and receives government recognition – still needs to be understood and accepted by Chinese society at large.
The sixth plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), held from November 8 to 11, adopted the third significant ""historical resolution"" (历史决议 lìshǐ juéyì). These official assessments of the Party's history address past achievements and future policies. Since its founding in 1921, the CPC has adopted two other important historical resolutions. Mao Zedong's ""Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party” (1945) was the theoretical outcome of the Yan'an Rectification Movement (延安整风运动 yán'ān zhěngfēng yùndòng) (1942-1945), criticizing the three ""leftist"" political lines and affirming Mao's position in the Party's history. The resolution was drafted and revised by Mao personally over a 15-month period. It was the first time that Mao Zedong Thought, as a theory of the sinicization of Marxism (马克思主义中国化 mǎkèsī zhǔyì zhōngguó huà), was clearly presented in the form of a Party document to guide the Chinese Revolution. In this resolution, the CPC carried out it's first ""inward self revolution"" (自我革命 zìwǒ gémìng) – describing the spirit and practice of the Party in renewing and improving itself. Adhering to the objective of ""clarity in ideology and unity among comrades"", the Resolution also laid the political, ideological, and organizational foundation for uniting the Party in the victorious war against Japanese aggression. Deng Xiaoping's ""Resolution on Certain Historical Issues of the Party since the Founding of the People's Republic of China"" (1981) provided a scientific summary of the major historical issues after the founding of New China. This included giving a very positive evaluation on the period of basic completion of socialist transformation (1949-1956) and highlighting the major mistakes of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). The Resolution factually evaluated the historical status of Mao and affirmed the significance of Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the Party, emphasizing that his theory should be distinguished from his mistakes during the later years. The Resolution also put forward, for the first time, the idea of the ""primary stage of socialism"" (社会主义初级阶段 shèhuì zhǔyì chūjí jiēduàn), raised questions about the form of and means to build socialism, and was foundational to later defining the path to socialism with Chinese characteristics. To this day, the two historical resolutions remain an important basis for the CPC – the world's largest political party with over 90 million members – to help build consensus regarding its own historical issues.

"To finance short-term expenses, there are few better tools than business lines of credit. This article looks at how they work and what makes them so useful.
How Business Lines of Credit Work
When a business sets up a line of credit, the business receives access to a certain amount of money. The business is only on the hook for repaying what it withdraws to make purchases, in addition to interest on the withdrawn amount. For instance, a business that uses $3,500 of a $7,000 line of credit to finance short-term purchases will need to repay a principal amount of $3,500. As the business pays the money back, the amount of available funds will regenerate accordingly. The payments will be due on a set schedule, often monthly. After the business has paid back $3,500 (plus applicable interest), it will have access to the full $7,000 again.
Why Business Lines of Credit Are Advantageous
Business lines of credit shine in many situation, especially when the goal is to finance short-term expenses. One reason is speed: Rather than wading through a lengthy loan application before making a purchase, the business can immediately withdraw funds from its line of credit. Another reason is that business lines of credit usually have lower interest rates than credit cards.
How to Get a Business Line of Credit
Before you can use a line of credit to finance short-term business costs, you’ll need to gain one through an application process. One option is to do so through a traditional bank, but an alternative lender may offer a faster application process.
Lines of credit can come in secured and unsecured variants. Businesses with strong credit histories are more likely to be able to access an unsecured agreement, but either option can help a business with its short-term finance goals.

"(MENAFN- Kashmir Observer)
IN the fourth ten years of the last century, Alexis Carrel, a French Surgeon, Nobel laureate and Sociologist bemoaned the absence of built-in and comprehensive“science of man”. Carrel went on to write an complete treatise“Man The Unknown” to circumscribe the lacunae, flaws and misgivings arising out of the unprecedented progress in Good (Material) sciences and the lag expert by Normative (Social) sciences. Carrel had definitely predicted that galloping progress in science and technological know-how, with small or no consideration to social sciences, endangered the entire society and posed worries like social chaos, hyper-consumerism, unchecked capitalism, massive scale poverty, crimes and social and worldwide paranoia. The predictions have turned correct and an asynchronous connection between materials and social sciences has thwarted our society and globe versus the issues and conundrums of all breeds. Our society, based mostly on and pushed by the ideas of Capitalist financial system as it is, has asymmetrically favoured sciences that consequence in increase of money and materials efficiency and ignoring social sciences to the place of neglect.
What picture emerges in our minds as we try out to imagine of social sciences? It is usually an graphic dominated by the graphics of armchair scholars, skimming through summary thoughts and specified to theories least pertinent to human life. These photos of a sociologist, which remove him farther away from the orbits actual social organization and challenge him into some summary room are the two insufficient and incorrect. If atoms are the constituents of issue, persons are the constituents of culture and phone for Sociological investigation and understanding as a great deal as atoms contact for scientific knowing. Society is neither the domain of biology nor physics, but rests on principles that are termed Sociological rules and by their nature get in touch with for Sociological knowledge. It is modern society and adult males living therein which variety the raison de etre of sciences, of all technological adventures and all other pursuits implied by the term“Positive Sciences”. In any scenario of Social disequilibrium, any episode of social catastrophe or any accident of social import, the material progress loses its well worth and that means. This would make the concern and relevance of social sciences an unavoidable phenomenon and any lag or lapse on this entrance involves the coup of civilization. In this context, exactly where social sciences rise to the event of embracing the overall civilization in its lap, what are the contours and tasks that Social Sciences and Humanities are intended to presume?
Social Researchers are auditors of modern society, which examine, not only the micro concerns in their quantitative component, but also study and scrutinise the qualitative balance of social superstructure on the full. Social Sciences and Humanities are indispensable in determining our relation to our have self, to culture and the bodily world at big. Any coverage making which isn’t going to incorporate insights and understandings from social science is bound to commit excessive and errors. It is by virtue of social sciences that a complete-scale knowing of culture is introduced in and procedures, remedial measures, initiatives are adopted appropriately. In absence of appropriate Sociological understanding, the remedial measures adopted and the procedures followed, not only conclude in fiasco but sometimes backfire in a lousy way.
The aforesaid support in plan creating is by no usually means the only or the main function assigned to Social Sciences. Their role in resolving social tensions, in retaining values in the experience of denuding modernity and their significance in stabilising establishments is well recognized and acknowledged. In a earth exactly where the challenges of identification, individuality, absence of this means and such are conspicuous, the job and responsibility of Social Sciences is augmented multi-fold. Having said that, the significance of Social Sciences is so clear that our policy makers, directors, educationists and governments really should have been proactive about the exact same. But the dismal state of social sciences is a induce of concern not only from an academic issue of see but from a social level of look at also. As we entrust our material nicely getting to researchers and technocrats, so is it compulsory to make Sociologists and Social experts the trustees of our social health, lest we find out our modern society in the throes of anarchy and problem.
There has been an additional component compounding the decline of social sciences which has to do with the typical tutorial orientations in our modern society. There has been an ascendancy in the amount of students opting for sciences for the earlier number of a long time and this fit has been adopted beneath the influence of two presumptions – a person is that mothers and fathers envisage their child’s instruction as some form of expense and wish of high returns. They see science and related educational fields as the fertile floor from an investment decision issue of see and hence direct their wards towards science. This alerts us to the further social malice which sees education not as signifies of enlightenment but a refined type of gamble where investments are manufactured in training with the prospect of bigger returns. There is a different misconception – and in truth a graver a person surrounding social sciences. Social sciences have appear to be viewed as a little something which are intellectually less vigorous and which do not involve educational excellence. Those opting for social sciences are getting covertly observed as lacking mental stamina and academic advantage in comparison to their scientific peers and this has catastrophically motivated the possibilities of pupils, who are pressured to choose for Sciences to meet their familial and group force. Each these tendencies are regressive which distort the truth to the effect of creating reduction of excellent manpower invested in social sciences. There is no relation of the buy of inequality among Good and Normative sciences, but they complement and supplement every single other in pursuance of the more substantial entire.
Yet another tragedy has strike the evolution of social sciences and that comes from the point that pupils beneath peer stress, pressure from family and other circles are discouraged to opt for social sciences as these are mistakenly witnessed as tutorial disciplines of lesser buy. The fever of engineering and clinical reports, accompanied by several other qualified programs has grabbed the tutorial horizon and a scant variety of students are noticed opting social sciences, though as the vast majority of students, most of them currently being sharp and vivid are lured in the direction of professional courses. The unwell-launched and irrational stereotype surrounding social sciences requirements to be lose off at the earliest and it wants to be borne in brain that at the apex of social hierarchy are social scientists, whose visions and insights shape and affect the entire culture.
The duty of tilting the educational bob in direction of social sciences is one thing incumbent on all the stakeholders – general public as very well as governments. In a modern society like ours, festering as it is with social diseases of all sorts, the urgency to take social sciences seriously gathers extra value and indispensability. Owning witnessed prevalent wars and violence, systemic exclusion of persons, humanitarian troubles of humongous get, the endeavor cannot be delayed.

We also have all installation instructions here. We are available 24/7 via phone if you run into any issues! (800) 406-5257
Q: Is it safe to tow with?
A: Absolutely! If anything, one might argue that it’s safer to tow with our module. With our module you can tow as you normally would. Make sure to use your trucks tow/haul mode when in tow!
Q: How much power will I actually gain?
A: On average we see gains of 30-90 hp to the wheels and up to 120 lb-ft of torque. Keep in mind these modules provide functional low to midrange power in the daily driving and towing RPM range. A dyno measures power at wide open throttle – it doesn’t measure daily driving improvements like rolling into the throttle and holding gears better. These modules make a difference in the 99% of driving situations when you aren’t at wide open throttle.
Q: Why should I get a module instead of a tuner?
A: Different strokes for different folks! If you are looking to turn your truck into race car, maybe a tuner is better suited for. Tuners focus on top end power. Our module focuses on the low to mid-range RPMs where most all of your driving is spent. Tuners flash your ECM, void your warranty, and produce additional wear and tear on your engine. The Dr. Performance Module is a safe way to gain power all without sacrificing your warranty.",<urn:uuid:4cdfcae6-86f8-400a-ba62-310124ce262d>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://drperformancerx.com/pages/faqs,2024-02-20T23:11:26Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.924864649772644,515,1.136955976486206,1
"Who would’ve thought that The Amazing Race Philippines: DryedMangoez Edition would make it to its 23rd season? I certainly didn’t. lol But here we are! Another brand-new season of your favorite not-real Amazing Race franchise!
After Clotho sends Houtarou flying back, Supana and Rinne charge toward her and grab her. That gives Houtarou time to uphenshin to SteamHopper and then deliver a Burning Fever attack that drives her away.
BTOB’s Lim Hyunsik (임현식) is one of my Ultimate Biases. Though he initially was just my bias in BTOB for his amazing vocals, it was his first solo song “Swimming” in 2017 that really grabbed my attention. Since then, I’ve grown to admire and respect Hyunsik as an artist and a person. And he’s become one of my favorite artists.
Well, this season is going downhill fast! Lol I’m gonna say right off the bat, the only way this season can be redeemed at this point is if Sandra makes it to the end as a Faithful and wins. Otherwise, eek!
ToQger has that perfect mix of legit drama and happy fun. A warmth and sincerity that not many other toku seasons have. It is a season that still resonates with me ten years later. And I am so thankful to everyone involved in the season for helping to bring it to such vivid life.
If there was a webseries that best exemplifies the drawbacks of the platform and format, it is Behind Cut (비하인드 컷). This BL series, like many a webseries, has a solid premise. But the limitations of the platform and format keep it from being a more well-put together series. Its story, execution and the performances of its promising cast are held back. And ultimately, while a quick watch, leaves you unsatisfied in the end.
Houtarou, Rinne and Hopper1 come back from Gotcha’ing Tricera Chemy. But they are surprised to see Renge acting a bit strange. Sabimaru says she’s been this way since yesterday. Mama Ichinose says based on her experience, Renge is in love.",<urn:uuid:e4ed328f-8dab-41a1-b3a0-692a63fa42cd>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://dryedmangoez.com,2024-02-20T22:37:08Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9648907780647278,495,0.6695809960365295,1
"“I thought of making myself a beautiful marionette. It must be wonderful, one that can dance, fence and turn somersaults.”
A group of friends participating in the school decathlon go out for fries and shakes after practice. They are jokingly competitive with each other and later go their separate ways. But one of them, Brandon, is attacked while walking through the park.
Meanwhile, Nick and Juliette are all dressed up to go to a dinner where Renard accepts an award. Wu and Hank are there too as they watch Renard give a speech. Afterwards, Nick gets the call about Brandon and since Hank didn’t bring his car, Renard offers to drive Juliette home.
Juliette walks to the front door and Renard watches her take the spare key from under the plant. She heads upstairs and gets in the shower. Renard sneaks into the house and up to the bedroom where he stares at her naked body through the glass. He tries controlling his urges as he takes a picture of Juliette and Nick from atop the dresser. Juliette hears something, gets out of the shower and notices the glass of the picture frame is broken, but back on the mantle.
Renard’s face is crawling. Literally. Trying to hold back his wolge, he almost runs into a man walking on the street. He gets out, punches him and drives off.
Next morning, Nick and Hank question Brandon’s friends, including Pierce and Jenny. They don’t get anything, but meet the Decathlon coach outside the home. Turns out he’s a Lowen and is very protective of his decathlon kids. They immediately suspect him.
Apparently, the Decathlon is serious stuff. If they win at Nationals, the Ivy Leagues will come to them. At the station, Sgt. Wu introduces Nick and Hank to the new intern, Ryan. He’s a big fan of them and has been following their careers since they rescued that little girl last year (in the pilot!?). Needless to say, he’s very excited.
Over in good ol’ Vienna, Austria, Adalind just happens to run into Renard’s brother, Eric. And with talk of restoring the Royal family, betrayals and Sean Renard, he takes her to his castle. They have a drink and she has him tell her about Renard’s past. Eric explains Sean’s a “half-Royal,” the son of his father’s mistress who was a Hexenbeist. To avoid all the drama, the Hexenbeist brought Renard to Portland on one of his father’s private jets.
Eric then suggests they put all their clothes to the floor, quite literally. But Adalind mentioning the Grimm seems to interest him more.
Back in Portland, Monroe is still taking care of the shop himself when Renard comes in looking for something to cure obsessive behavior. Monroe ties to question him to pinpoint the ailment and says he’ll have to research it and get back to him tomorrow. Renard refuses to leave a name or number.
Jenny calls Pierce. She’s guilty over not having forced Brandon to let her give him a ride home. They agree to meet at the bleachers at school. Jenny arrives first when she hears a very Filipino “Psst!” which leads her to her death.
Same attack as Brandon. But Nick finds a watch in her hand with the engraving “To Pierce, Love Mom.”
Nick and Hank go to Pierce’s home where he’s shooting hoops in the driveway. The show him the watch as his mother comes outside. They both wolge, but aren’t Lowen. They head back inside. Pierce is in bed with a headache. Mom leaves hot chocolate for him which he spills onto his pillow. He takes the pillowcase to the wash and when he opens the washing machine, sees the water blood red. Mom comes to usher him upstairs. But they then get a call from Coach who says after Brandon and Jenny’s murders, he’s pulling the school out of the competition. Pierce appears devastated.
At Aunt Marie’s trailer, Nick finds Pierce and mother are Genio Innocuo, first found on the Galapagos Islands. Apparently, Nick’s ancestors hung out with Darwin. The Genio Innocuo are shy, intelligent, and compassionate Wesen and are not violent, which made “dispatching of them quite easy,” the journal reads.
They decide to go to Coach’s house where they find him dead, attacked the same as the other two.
Pierce calls Nick and tells him he’s scared. Mom comes in and hangs the phone up. He runs to the laundry room. Mom tells him he doesn’t understand what’s happening and she’s sorry.
He accuses her of the murders and to prove it, pulls the clothes out of the washing machine. But it’s actually his clothes.
Mom continues to explain, she didn’t want anyone to hurt him. If she had known it would happen like this, she never would’ve done it. She was only trying to make him better than her and to give him the traits she never had.
He suddenly wolges, not into a Genio Innocuo, but into a Lowen. He goes after Mom. Nick and Hank arrive and Nick and Pierce fight all over the living room. To Hank’s shock, he finds Nick trying to knock Pierce unconscious. They check on the Mom who tells them she made him that way. Before he was even born, she altered his genetic material to make him both a Genio Innocuo and a Lowen, but he doesn’t know and the Lowen presents itself on its own.
Pierce manages to sneak out and they track him down to the water tower at Montogomery Park. He’s sitting, then standing on the edge, blaming himself. He wolges into a Genio Innocuo, then into the Lowen. The Lowen says he killed just to Pierce could be the best. Regular Pierce returns and decides to jump, but Nick saves him.
Back at the station, Renard laments that Pierce, the poor kid, will have a hard time in jail, being that he’s 18.
“You’re in my spot bitch.”
Some thugs want to show Pierce “who’s king of this jungle.” But, Pierce isn’t just some weak 18 year old kid. Looks like no one’s going to make him their bitch in prison, that’s for sure.
Back at the shop, Renard returns and Monroe tells him there’s a sort of “reverge Viagra” to take care of the physical effects of the ailment. But to take care of the emotional aspect, it’s more complicated. Both Renard and the object of obsession both have to go through treatment. So if Renard is willing is to bring the woman (or man!) in for consultation…
No, Renard says. Monroe, however, tells him if gone untreated, the symptoms will get worse and more dangerous. Not just for him, but for anyone standing between him and whoever he’s hung up on.
“This could get really gnarly.”
Indeed! I’m actually looking forward to seeing this part of the story get gnarly. Maybe Renard’s identity will soon be revealed to Nick? It was very creepy though, that whole scene with Renard creeping on Juliette. Icky too, yes?
The case of the week was great. It seems like we haven’t seen anyone under the age of 25 of Grimm in a long time, coincidentally enough, since they “saved the little girl” last year. Speaking of, I wonder what Ryan the intern will bring.
The case was cleverly written. There were a lot of suspect possibilities, but as soon as Adalind and Eric had that talk of half-brothers then cutting straight to the scene of Pierce and his Mother, I knew he must be some kind of multi-ethic or multi-Wesen kid.
Then I thought it would turn into a story of mixed-Wesen children, which would then possibly relate to Monroe and Rosalee. But it merely turned out to be Mother messing with her unborn baby’s DNA. I guess the race episode and bi-Wesen story will be saved for another day. I also like when they feature the nice Wesen. The non-violent ones. They even make a point to give them warm eyes. It’s very cool to see that even in the Wesen world, there are those who don’t want to eat the first human they see. The prison scene was also fun, and kinda hilarious. Being a Wesen will definitely come in handy to help keep from getting backdoored, if you know what I mean.",<urn:uuid:4ab33551-f1f3-401d-add5-212fefd986b3>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://dryedmangoez.com/2012/10/19/recap-grimm-episode-2-08-the-other-side/,2024-02-20T21:37:28Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9760816097259521,1929,0.8051785230636597,1

"Claim: A Facebook user claims Tuface prays for his wife as she battles cancer.
Verdict: FALSE! The image used in this claim is a recirculated photo from a 2015 cancer awareness shoot.
A Facebook User LoveDoctor Daniels, posted on his page that Annie Idibia, wife of Innocent Idibia, popularly known as TuFace, is battling cancer. In the post, Mr Daniels claims that TuFace is calling on Nigerians to pray for his wife as she is battling cancer. Mr Daniels also claims that Annie Idibia has not felt well for a long time. The post also contained a link with the narration, “cancer.facebook.com”.
The post featuring a frail picture of Annie has garnered 580,000 likes, 16,000 comments and 41 shares.
The virality of the post, the sympathy attracted, the sensitivity of the claim and the personalities involved made us at DUBAWA investigate it.
To verify the picture used, we ran a deep analysis using Google Lens and found out that it was a photo from a Breast cancer-inspired shoot in 2015 tagged “against all odds.” The shoot was done to create awareness about breast cancer and the importance of self-examination.
We also clicked on the link attached to the picture, which redirected us to a betting site. We discovered that its essence was to drive traffic to the betting site.
There is also no post by Tuface about the alleged illness of his wife. Ms Idibia further debunked the rumour in 2020.
The post claiming Annie Idibia has cancer is false. There is no statement from Tuface soliciting prayers for his wife.

"GM duckers! Wow, how stressful to write this first article! It’s going to be a looong and perilous adventure, full of unexpected events, encounters, good and bad ideas, initiatives… but most of all, laughter and great memes! I’m so excited!
Let’s calm down and start at the beginning. I’m Mark Duckerberg, yours truly, and with the help of Warren Duckett and M0therDucker, two crypto friends, I created the cryptocurrency Duckereum.
What’s all this about?
If you’ve been in the cryptosphere for a few years, you’ve seen the same thing I have. New projects are launched almost every day, by brilliant people full of talent, aiming to revolutionize their sector thanks to the blockchain and their token. Hmm.
The blockchain is an incredible invention that can also be used for self-deprecation, for laughter, for fun, without a super mega giga revolutionary project that will change the world forever.
That’s why Doge is there, and all the other meme tokens… you said?
We love Doge. And we so wish we could have been there at the beginning, to enjoy the memes and the light-hearted, fun, no-holds-barred, marketcap-free community spirit. Unfortunately, we were still chicks, and discovered the crypto world too late. And then, what a shock! Why do we have the feeling that all the tweets and discussions about Doge are only about its dollar value?
As for the other meme tokens, they simply do not deserve the name. If they are not pure scams, they all share the same ridiculous ambitions to increase their marketcap at all costs, using exaggerated incentives to buy (which are not financial advice, of course), competing to make deals with unscrupulous influencers who don’t hesitate to share anything as long as they get paid. What exactly is funny about that?
No, no, no… it’s time to make crypto fun again. We want to revive the light-hearted and oh-so-pleasant spirit of Doge. And that’s why we created Duckereum, which has no other purpose than to make people laugh, to bring joy, good, sincerity, and smiles to this crazy world! We don’t have anything to revolutionize, we don’t promise any return on investment (we even think you should invest your money in something else), we don’t have any deflationary mechanisms or deals with great scamme… influencers to make our currency increase in value.
We just want great memes. We’d love to see people competing with genius to make others laugh and bring joy to this sometimes very sad sphere.
But, all work deserves to be paid, doesn’t it? We can’t ask people to make fantastic memes for nothing. So here we are...
Okay, so what exactly is going to happen?
We’ve created Duckereum, which exists in 100 million tokens, and we’ve set aside 5 million of them (5% of the total supply) in a community wallet. Half of these tokens will be used to reward the winners of the meme contests that will be organized in the coming years, at a rate of 1 per week. The rewards are already fixed and will never change:
- Meme contest #1 to #25: 25,000 Duckereum for the winner
- Meme contest #26 to #75: 15,000 Duckereum for the winner
- Meme contest #76 to #150: 10,000 Duckereum for the winner
- Meme contest #151 to #250: 5,000 Duckereum for the winner
Each contest will have a set theme related to the news, and the Duckereum community (the Duckereum DAO for the serious guys reading) will vote for the funniest meme: the winner will receive some Duckereum. This is the super giga revolutionary project that is to threaten the established order of the American dollar and bring financial freedom to… uh, no. It won’t do any of that. But, at least, we should have some fun!
The second half of the tokens will be used for what the community has decided. All expenses, whatever they are, are scrupulously justified on a Google Sheets accessible to all.
And that’s it?
Yes, that’s all. Well, that’s all me, Warren and MD will do. But, we strongly encourage all the brilliant people who will join the Duckers’ community to create other utilities with Duckereum. A game? That would be great. A bot that sends tips? What the d*ck, when?! Because, even if our goal is to make crypto fun again, we didn’t skimp on security. Duckereum is an extremely simple smartcontract that lives on the Ethereum blockchain (don’t get me wrong), with no tax or complicated mechanisms, and renounced. The liquidity is locked many years. You are safe!
If you didn’t understand the last sentence, it means that you are still DeFi chicks, as we were. We are delighted that you are starting your adventure in this crazy world with us.
Each week, I will keep a diary on my personal Medium account, describing what happened during the last days. Yes, because Duckereum is going to be far too funny not to win people’s hearts, so someone has to tell the whole story...
Week by week, I will objectively detail what happened. So it’s up to the community to decide what the paper will say…

I am Mark Duckerberg, no one in particular. I discovered cryptocurrencies 2 years ago, and I lost all my money, because of unscrupulous people who scammed me. But, I won something: the meeting of the following two ducks.

Warren Duckett was there long before me, long before most of you. Bitcoin has changed his life, and he spends most of his time playing sports now, taking care of his family, and making investments.

"The Big Island of Hawaii has so much to offer! On just one island, you have erupting volcanoes, lush botanical gardens, amazing snorkeling, coffee plantations, and so much more!
To make the most of your trip, read on for tips on where to stay and what to do during your trip to the Big Island of Hawaii.
- Big Island of Hawaii: What You Need to Know Before You Go
- 5 Incredible Foods That You Need to Eat in Hawaii
- What to Pack for Hawaii: Everything You Need for an Amazing Adventure
Where to Stay
While the Big Island of Hawaii isn’t huge, it does take 1-2 hours to drive across the island. To avoid spending a lot of time driving, I recommend staying in three different areas during your stay: Waikoloa Village, Kailua-Kona, and Hilo.
While it can seem like a hassle to pack up your things and move to another location, you’ll be cutting a lot of driving time out of your trip. That’s time you can spend exploring the Big Island!
I recommend starting your trip at one of the resorts in the Waikoloa Village area.
Fly into the Kona International Airport at Keahole and pick up a rental car once you arrive.
TIP: If you’re going to Mauna Kea’s summit, you’ll need a four-wheel drive car.
After you get your rental car, time to head off to your resort! While staying in the Waikoloa Village area, you can:
1. Kick back & relax
Take advantage of the great beaches and pools at the resorts in this area. Get in the vacation mindset and recover from jet-lag. The Big Island isn’t known for its beaches, so take time to enjoy the beaches here.
2. Try paddle boarding, yoga, or hula dancing
The resorts usually offer fun activities for you to try. Ask at your resort’s front desk for a list of activities offered during your stay, like paddle boarding, yoga, or hula dancing!
3. Visit Mauna Kea
Mauna Kea is a dormant volcano with an amazing, free star gazing program. It’s located about halfway between Waikoloa Village and Hilo, so you can also visit Mauna Kea while staying in either area.
Read more about visiting Mauna Kea at Mauna Kea: Essential Guide for Your Visit.
For the next part of your trip, pack up your bags and head to Kailua-Kona! Once in Kailua-Kona, you can:
4. Snorkel in Kealakekua Bay by the Captain Cook Monument
Kealakekua Bay by the Captain Cook Monument is known for its amazing snorkeling – coral reefs, colorful fish, and the occasional eel and turtle! Captain Cook met his end here after trying to hold a Hawaiian chief for ransom.
TIP: I recommend going on a tour to snorkel in Kealakekua Bay. The only other way to get there is to hike three miles downhill with your snorkel equipment and then hike three miles back uphill after you’re done. There are inexpensive tours available on Trip Advisor.
We used Sea Quest for our snorkeling adventures and we were really happy with them. They gave us tips on where to find the best snorkeling spots and went out of their way so that we could see dolphins!
5. Night snorkel with manta rays
I have to admit – the idea of going snorkeling at night with manta rays freaked me out. But after multiple people told me that this was their favorite experience on the Big Island, I had to try it out. And I’m glad I did!
Several tour groups offer night snorkeling tours with manta rays on the Big Island. You’ll want to go on a tour that’s in the Kailua-Kona area by the Sheraton for the best experience.
You’ll float in the ocean while holding on to a board that has lots of lights attached to it. The lights attract plankton. And the plankton attract the manta rays. To get the plankton, the manta rays do flips underneath your board over and over again. It’s an amazing thing to see!!
6. Visit a coffee plantation
The weather, altitude, and soil make the Kailua-Kona area ideal for coffee-growing. We visited the Mountain Thunder Coffee Plantation while on the Big Island. They offer daily tours of their coffee-making process and are located within a cloud forest!
7. Visit the Kona Brewery
We loved the Kona Brewery. They had great pizza and craft brews for any beer drinkers in your group. You can go on a tour of the brewery at 10:30AM or 3PM any day of the week.
8. Eat shaved ice with ice cream
Shaved ice is similar to a snow cone, but with smaller shards of ice and lots more delicious juice. For the ultimate treat, get ice cream in the middle of your shaved ice. I’m serious. It’s delicious. You have to try it! Ask for it at Scandinavian Shave Ice.
9. Find white pineapple at a farmers’ market
We heard about white pineapple from several locals on the Big Island. They told us it was sweeter than regular pineapple and less acidic. And so our hunt for white pineapple began…
We found white pineapple at the Kona Farmers’ Market. The pineapple was definitely white inside! It still tasted like pineapple, but how pineapple tastes when it’s perfectly ripe (which is hard to find!). It was still acidic, but not quite as acidic as regular pineapple.
TIP: Our white pineapple was really expensive. We didn’t try to haggle the price down, but I recommend you give it a try.
10. Go diving
Some members of our group went diving on the Big Island and had a great experience with Jack’s Diving Locker. If you’re on the fence, they offer an introductory diving class in a pool so you can try it out before deciding whether to dive in the ocean.
TIP: You’ll risk decompression sickness if you fly or drive to high altitudes right after diving, so be careful to avoid high altitude areas (like the coffee plantations and Mauna Kea) after diving.
11. Attend a luau
Next stop on your trip is Hilo for volcanoes and more outdoor adventures! In Hilo, you can:
12. See volcanoes!
On the Hilo side of the island, you can visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and see an active lava lake, lava tubes, and steam vents. You can even take a boat or helicopter tour to see the lava up close!
Find out everything you need to know about visiting volcanoes on the Big Island here.
13. Walk through the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden
The Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden has an amazing variety of plant life and beautiful views of the ocean.
A few things to know:
- Admission is $18 for adults, $5 for ages 6 to 16, and free for ages 5 and below.
- There is a very long, steep ramp at the entrance to the garden. It’s a long, steep journey down to enter the garden and a long, steep journey up to exit the garden.
- Many of the plants aren’t native to Hawaii. The plants are still amazing to see; however, don’t be surprised that many of the plants are from other areas of the world.
14. Visit Akaka Falls
Akaka Falls is a spectacular waterfall. The waterfall is very close to a paved parking lot, so very little walking is involved to see this view!
The entrance fee is $5 per car or $1 per person for pedestrians. The parking lot can be a little crowded, but you won’t have to wait long for someone to leave and open up a spot.
15. Visit Rainbow Falls in Wailuku River State Park
Rainbow Falls is well-named – you can often see a rainbow in the waterfall’s spray around 10AM in the morning on sunny days. When we went, it was cloudy, so we unfortunately didn’t get to see a rainbow. But the waterfall was still beautiful without the rainbow!
Like Akaka Falls, Rainbow Falls is close to a paved parking lot, so very little walking is required. And there’s no entrance fee!
I hope these tips help you to make the most of your trip to the Big Island of Hawaii! Before you set off to Hawaii, check out Big Island of Hawaii: What You Need to Know Before You Go.

"What are the best blinds to purchase for your home offices or study spaces? You can believe that it makes no difference or that any blind will do. But, the Venetian blinds you select might have a significant impact on the room’s overall comfort, helping or hurting your productivity.
For generations, people all around the world have used Venetian blinds to cover the windows of their homes and places of business. Between 1100 and 1500, Venetian blinds have come from Persia (current-day Iran). Venetian blinds are still favored today because of their usefulness, toughness, elegance, and classic design. We examine some of their amazing qualities below.
Adaptability and Command
Venetian blinds are great for controlling light and maintaining privacy. It is simple to adjust the blade angles to let in more or less light. You can also fully raise them to allow a continuous stream of sunlight to enter the room through the windows.
Venetian blinds are simple to open and close, making it simple to control privacy. These blinds can provide you with the privacy you need, whether you wish to close your windows at night, have neighbors close by, are near a public footpath, or for other reasons.
You can remove Venetian blinds from the windows to fully clean them. To keep them fresh and stain-free, some blinds require specific cleaning solutions, while curtains need to be vacuumed and washed. With Venetian blinds, maintaining their best appearance only requires a quick wipe-down with a moist cloth or microfiber cloth. If they are damaged, they are also simple to fix. It is so that individual slats and other blind components, such as the motor that raises and lowers the slats and opens and closes them, can be simply replaced.
Durable and Reliable
High-quality Venetian blinds are quite resilient. They can resist years of exposure to moisture and sunlight when made of high-density polymer or well-treated wood, and they will remain sturdy and preserve their lovely appearance. Venetian blinds are less susceptible to damage from kids than other window coverings are.
Some Venetian blinds at Country won’t split or warp. It makes them an excellent option for people who need window coverings in areas where there is a lot of natural light coming in or where condensation may build as a result of temperature changes or being in a moist environment like the kitchen or bathroom.
Aluminium Venetian blinds are extremely economical when compared with other blinds. As they can be tailored to be any shade and are available in a selection of finishes, you don’t have to shred your budget to give your home a beautiful finish.
Venetian blinds are highly adaptable and work well in a range of architectural styles, from modern offices to country residences. Simply pick a material and finish that you like. You can mount them on a variety of window sizes and types as well. It is possible to size and cut Venetian blinds to fit practically any type of window.
Lower Heat in the summer
Venetian blinds can provide benevolent cooling during the warmest months of the year. In addition to making you drowsy and causing concentration problems, the summer can cause your computer and other electronic gadgets to overheat. You can simply tilt Venetian blinds to let the breeze flow through while preventing the room from overheating and preventing heat from collecting and stagnating in the space. So the next time you’re working on your study and becoming hot and sweaty, open your window, leave the door slightly ajar, and let the draught move through the space to help you cool off and improve your focus.
Venetian Blinds Avoid Glare
You can change Venetian blinds throughout the day to prevent glare for optimal productivity thanks to its simple-to-operate design. Light glare can harm your electronics and furniture in addition to being distracting when it bounces off of surfaces like computer screens. The greatest options for keeping your workstation and improving studying are blinds that are simple to adjust to the changing weather throughout the day while letting in some natural light.

"Snake Plants are a popular beginner houseplant known for being easy to take care of. This succulent thrives with very little maintenance, minimal watering, and can handle indirect or direct sunlight. But like any living thing, Snake Plants are still susceptible to the elements.
Snake Plants are notable for their striking pointy green leaves. If you notice those leaves aren’t as pointy or green as when you first bought them, there might be a problem. Soft or discolored leaves are usually one of the first signs that a plant is dying.
You’ve given your plant water, sunlight, a good pot–all the things a plant needs to live. So, why is my Snake Plant dying?
A dying Snake Plant is usually caused by two issues: overwatering or extreme temperature fluctuations.
What Does an Overwatered Snake Plant Look Like?
Snake Plants are native to West Africa, which makes them suited to dry, hot conditions. As a succulent, Snake Plants naturally store water in their leaves. This means that a Snake Plant can usually go 1-2 weeks without watering.
A Snake Plant doesn’t look like your typical succulent, so they’re commonly overwatered. Sometimes you might not realize you’ve overwatered your Snake Plant until it’s too late.
Read on for some tell-tale signs of overwatering.
Brown Rotting Roots
When a plant doesn’t have proper drainage and receives too much water, an ailment called root rot can occur. This is when the roots sit in water for so long they start to turn brown and mushy.
When the soil stays overly wet for long periods, fungi such as pythium, fusarium, and phytophthora begin to grow. This fungus spreads to the roots which causes them to rot.
Eventually, these rotted roots will prevent nutrients from traveling up to the plant. What comes next is the leaves begin to turn soft and mushy. This is due to excess water in the leaves which starts to break down the leaf’s cellular structure.
The natural result of mushy leaves is that your Snake Plant will actually start to droop or tip. Oftentimes the base of the leaves will start to crinkle and fold first due to the excess water. This will be pretty easy to notice since the Snake Plant’s leaves should be growing straight up.
Can a Snake Plant Recover From Overwatering?
If your Snake Plant has gotten to the point where it’s drooping, the overwatering problem is pretty serious. You’ll need to act quickly to save your Snake Plant from dying.
Here’s what to do:
- Move your Snake Plant to a sunny area of your home. Direct sunlight will help this excess moisture evaporate naturally. Do not use methods such as a hair dryer to dry out your soil, as this can damage the plant even more!
- Remove the plant from the soil and assess its roots. When the roots are dry, it’ll be easier to determine the extent of the root rot.
- Prune any slimy brown roots to try and tame the root rot.
- Repot the Snake Plant with fresh soil.
The extent of the root rot will determine if the Snake Plant will recover. If the root system is completely rotten, the plant is unlikely to bounce back.
How Do You Tell If a Snake Plant is Overwatered or Underwatered?
Overwatering is certainly a more common issue, but underwatering will also harm your Snake Plant. What makes things tricky is that both conditions have overlapping symptoms.
If you forget to water your Snake Plant for longer than 2 weeks, you may notice:
- Wrinkled leaves
- Brown dry tips
- Dry soil
While wrinkled leaves are a symptom of both overwatering and underwatering, the differences are easy to spot. With overwatering, wrinkled leaves appear soft and mushy. With underwatering, wrinkled leaves appear dehydrated and dry.
If you’re unsure if the problem is underwatering or overwatering, the easiest solution is to actually remove your plant from its pot. Then, check the soil below the surface and feel if it is too dry or too wet.
How Do Temperature Fluctuations Harm Snake Plants?
We know that Snake Plants are best suited for warm, dry environments. That’s why we keep Snake Plants as indoor plants—in a warm house where we can control the elements. In places like the Southern U.S., Snake Plants can thrive outdoors because the environment closely resembles their natural habitat.
Since the Snake Plant is grown to live in warm environments, it can react poorly to cold conditions. A Snake Plant should be housed in temperatures from 50°F to 75°F (or 10°C to 23°C). An environment colder than 50°F (10°C) can make your Snake Plant go into shock, go dormant, and possibly die.
Can My Snake Plant Get Too Cold?
It’s possible for a Snake Plant to get cold enough to die. When your plant is exposed to extended periods of cold, it can damage the cell structure of the leaf. This prevents water and nutrients from flowing to all parts of the plant. This is possible if you leave your Snake Plant outside, or if it’s placed by a cold window for too long.
Your plant can suffer from the cold even by watering it with cold water. When the roots sense cold water, your plant may go dormant, thinking that winter has arrived. At this point, your plant may not suffer damage, but it will stop growing and may become stunted.
Symptoms of Cold Damage in a Snake Plant
It can take up to 4 weeks for the symptoms of cold damage to show, but when they do the first sign is usually curling leaves. This curling happens because the leaf’s cell structure has been damaged by the cold. The Snake Plant can no longer stand firm and will droop or curl.
White or light colored spots are a common result of leaves that have suffered frost damage. This is caused when the water inside the leaves freezes and expands. The cell bursts and the results are an unsightly white spot on your leaf. Sometimes, the entire leaf turns white as a result. This is unlikely to happen to an indoor Snake Plant but very possible for a plant left outside.
Is My Snake Plant Getting Too Much Sun?
While the cold is certainly a concern, on the opposite end of the spectrum Snake Plants can also suffer from too much sun.
Snake Plants can adapt to a wide variety of lighting situations, from indirect sunlight, to shade, to full-on direct sunlight. But just because they are succulents, doesn’t mean that they are immune to the sun’s heat.
A common symptom of too much sun is leaf burn. This is just like a sunburn for humans, and will show up in plants as a dark brown dry spot. If you notice leaf burn on your Snake Plant, move it to a shadier area of the house, or diffuse the sunlight with a sheer curtain.
How Do You Fix Brown Tips on Snake Plants?
If you’ve underwatered your Snake Plant, it’s common for the tips of the leaves to turn brown. Even if you return to a more regular watering schedule, those brown tips will not reverse themselves. They will stay there until the leaf itself dies and is replaced by a new one.
Brown tips can ruin the look of your plant, and make it seem unhealthy even when it isn’t. If you want, you can cut these brown tips off to get rid of them. This won’t hurt the plant, but it can affect the shape of the leaf.
When you trim the leaf, try to follow its natural shape. Avoid cutting too much into the healthy leaf tissue. To prevent the transfer of any plant diseases, you should always sterilize plant scissors with alcohol before and after using them.
Should I Cut Off Dying Snake Plant Leaves?
Pruning a Snake Plant is common practice to keep the leaves a uniform height. So, it’s certainly ok to cut off any dead leaves.
To do this, cut your leaf at the base, right at the soil line. It’s best to cut with a knife rather than scissors, so you can be precise. Avoid cutting any healthy neighboring leaves.
While cutting off leaves may cause your plant to look patchy, don’t fret! New growth will fill up this space in no time.
While Snake Plants are an easy beginner plant, they are not invincible. These succulents are native to dry and hot environments, which makes them susceptible to overwatering and temperature fluctuations. So if your Snake Plant is dying, these are the first two issues you should investigate.
The signs of an overwatered Snake Plant are brown, rotting roots and mushy or drooping leaves. If your Snake Plant has been exposed to cold temperatures below 50°F (10°C), it may show signs of stress like leaves with white spots or curling leaves.
If you can find the right balance of watering, and provide a warm environment, your Snake Plant is bound to be happy and healthy!",<urn:uuid:80d85804-c2ed-4fb8-9d07-ef1411ae88c9>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://eatsleepgarden.com/why-is-my-snake-plant-dying/,2024-02-20T21:50:14Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9356845617294312,1934,3.284313678741455,3

"Do you have a small business? Do you think that you are too small to be targeted by hackers? Or maybe don’t have anything that a hacker would want? They probably don’t even know about your small business, right?
Well, a cybersecurity firm Barracuda Networks, thinks otherwise. Their report analyzed millions of emails from thousands of organizations. And they found that small companies have a lot to worry about.
Researchers found somewhat alarming statistics. Employees at small companies saw 3.5 times more social engineering attacks than those at bigger ones. This data clearly shows that small businesses are more likely to fall victim to a cyberattack just from the sheer number of attacks against them.
There are many reasons why hackers see small businesses as an easier target, and why attacks on smaller businesses by hackers who are out to score a quick illicit buck became more frequent.
When you’re running a small business, it’s often a balancing act of where to invest your cash. You may know that cybersecurity is important, or even thought about outsourcing cybersecurity, but it may not be high enough on your list. So, at the end of the month, your cash runs out, and cybersecurity gets moved to the “next month” list.
Small business owners often cut costs way too much on things they know way too little about, and IT security is usually one of them. They may buy an antivirus service subscription and think that’s enough to completely cover them. But with the expansion of technology to the cloud, antivirus software became just a small layer of modern IT security solutions. To be adequately protected from cyberattacks you may need several more.
Hackers are well aware of it and see small businesses as an easier target. They understand that they can do less work and still get a payout, compared to trying to hack into a bigger company.
Every business, even a small online 1-person shop, has data that’s worth scoring. Credit card info, social security numbers, tax ID numbers, and email login credentials are all valuable. Cybercriminals can sell them on Dark Web forums. From there, other criminals may use them for identity theft, wire fraud, or other illegal schemes.
Here are some of the data that hackers will gladly go after:
Many smaller companies provide services to larger companies. Services like digital marketing, website management, accounting, etc. If a hacker breaches the network of a smaller business, they will most likely attempt to breach a bigger one as well.
Most vendors are digitally connected to their clients’ IT systems. Such type of relationship can enable a multi-company breach. While hackers don’t need such connection to hack a business, it is a nice bonus for them, they can kill two birds with one stone.
Ransomware has been one of the fastest-growing types of cyberattacks in the last decade. So far in 2022, 71% of organizations surveyed experienced one or multiple ransomware attacks. And the percentage of victims that pay the ransom has also been increasing. An average of 63% of companies that have suffered a ransomware attack paid their attackers in hopes of getting rid of the ransomware and decrypting their files.
Even if a hacker can’t get as much money from a small business as they could get from a larger organization, it’s still worth it. Breaching smaller companies is faster and easier than larger ones.
When victims pay the ransom, it motivates more cybercriminals to join in. And those newer hackers with less experience in ransomware attacks will often go after smaller, easier-to-breach businesses.
Another thing that is usually pretty low on the list of priorities for a small business owner is cybersecurity training. We’re talking about proper repeated employee cybersecurity awareness training.
Training employees on how to spot phishing attacks and how to properly protect their personal as well as business data often isn’t explained to them. This leaves even most high-tech networks vulnerable to one of the biggest dangers, human error.
In most types of cyberattacks, the hacker needs some degree of cooperation from a victim. Just like the classical vampire needs the unsuspecting victim to invite them into their house. Usually, it is done through “phishing emails” or their more modern counterparts “smishing messages”.
A phishing email by itself can’t usually do anything. It needs the victim to either open a file attachment or click a link that will take them to a malicious website. Thus, launching the attack.
Phishing attacks caused over 80% of all data breaches.
Teaching your employees how to spot these hacking attempts can significantly increase your cybersecurity. Security awareness training is as important as having a proper antivirus or a firewall setup.

"Sport occupies an unusual place in society. It’s simultaneously public and private – something we do for our own personal health, but also a multibillion-dollar industry; both political and apolitical, accessible and exclusive.
This is also why sport straddles such interesting territory when it comes to both the climate and nature crises.
Champions for Earth, an organisation of athletes promoting environmental action, was formed for exactly this reason.
“Climate change affects us all, and in pursuing solutions we must bring as many people together as possible,” their mission statement reads. “We see sport as a piece of that puzzle: unifying people across race, age, gender, sex, religion and disability.”
But, sport, as a sector, is also a major contributor to the damage being done to our planet: from the greenhouse gases emitted from transporting equipment, athletes and fans all over the world, to the harm done to ecosystems by venue construction, high-density events and poor waste management.
Sport is both a ‘victim’ and contributor to climate change
Though it’s impossible to accurately calculate sport’s contribution to global warming and biodiversity loss, some have compared its carbon footprint to that of a country the size of Spain.
Unlike many other industries, however, sport is also often situated on the frontlines of the climate emergency.
We saw this at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, as athletes passed out and faced serious health problems due to the excessive heat. This was clearer still at the Beijing Winter Olympics a few months later, as the Games became the first in history to rely almost entirely on artificial snow.
In the months since the Olympics, we’ve seen more races and competitions cancelled, relocated and postponed because of the direct effects of climate change.
A recent report from Badvertising argued that many of the major sponsors for winter sports were directly melting the snow necessary for events to take place. Britain’s most successful Winter Olympian Lizzy Yarnold said these deals were “like winter sport nailing the lid on its own coffin.”
“Sport is not just a victim of [climate] change, but an important contributor too,” writes author David Goldblatt in Rapid Transition Alliance’s report into the relationship between sport and climate change.
So how then can sport be used to tackle the environmental issues we’re collectively facing?
Athletes have a ‘unique perspective’
Hannah Mills is the most successful female sailor in Olympic history. After decades spent competing and training on coastlines around the world, the 34-year-old is acutely aware of both the gravity of the climate crisis and the impact major sporting events can have on the planet.
“There’s a big environmental footprint with sport,” Mills says, “so that on the one hand needs to be addressed, by reducing things like emissions and everything we possibly can.”
Her passion for environmentalism stems from a lifelong relationship with the outdoors.
“It’s one big playground that we’re lucky enough to get to use in so many different ways,” she says, “and through sailing you spend so much time outside on the ocean, which is a real privilege… you always have an appreciation for nature and just how vast the ocean is.”
Sport as a tool for finding local solutions
It was what Mills saw at her second Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro that crystallised for her the severity of our plastic pollution problem.
“I’d never seen anywhere where it was quite so stark,” Mills explains, “everywhere we’d sailed before you’d see the odd piece of plastic floating around, and I wouldn’t necessarily think too much of it. But in Rio… it became too much to ignore.”
Rio’s plastic pollution problem is also a good example of how localised issues – that need localised solutions – sometimes get lost when common environmental issues are considered on a global scale.
Decades of inadequate infrastructure and a lack of funding for waste management have caused the carpets of plastic waste that cover the otherwise beautiful coastline around Rio. But when that messaging gets oversimplified into general conversations about avoiding single-use plastics, rather than tackling the root causes of the specific crisis playing out in Rio, it’s clear to see why this leads to a lack of meaningful action.
This is where Mills feels sport has the opportunity to enact more meaningful change.
“We get this unique perspective and this unique impact as athletes or as sporting events to tell stories – and people, for whatever reason, listen and look up to athletes.”
Mills works with SailGP as the strategist for the Emirates Great Britain team, an international sailing competition that takes place across a season of grand prix events around the world. Similarly to the work being done by Extreme E, SailGP runs outreach initiatives in each racing location – not just to ensure the competition is sustainable, but in an effort to leave a lasting positive legacy.
“A huge part of the climate change narrative is that in every location there will be different solutions that are effective,” says Mills, “it’s about understanding that it’s not a one-size-fits-all.
“Yes, we all need to come together globally in terms of emissions. But actually, in terms of restoring and protecting nature, it’s very location-dependent as to what’s working,” she explains.
Some of SailGP’s local impact projects have included introducing “ecological anchoring” in an effort to preserve and restore seagrass beds off the coast of Saint-Tropez, developing large-scale solar farms in England, and planting native poplar trees in southern Italy.
Bringing the political to the apolitical?
When athletes, coaches or commentators raise issues like the urgent need to address the climate crisis, a common criticism is that this is seen as making a political point within a space that is ostensibly neutral.
There are separate conversations to be had about whether environmentalism should be considered political or whether sport has ever been remotely apolitical – but that’s perhaps best left for another time.
Sometimes climate action is seen as sufficiently apolitical to feature in sport, such as Reading FC’s fantastic collaboration with Reading University – incorporating the climate stripes into their kit.
— Ed Hawkins (@ed_hawkins) July 25, 2022
“I can really see the argument both ways,” Mills says, explaining that “in the field of play” people’s focus should perhaps be entirely on the sport and the competition.
“But I think there’s such an opportunity around athletes in the build-up to big events and in interviews during big events where you can really use your platform.”
For ultramarathon runner Damian Hall, however, sport and climate action are directly entwined. His latest book is even titled ‘We Can’t Run Away From This.’ He also co-founded The Green Runners, a community of running enthusiasts putting the planet first.
Hall recently won the 268-mile (430km) Spine Race – affectionately dubbed ‘Britain’s most brutal race’ – in a gruelling 84 hours and 36 minutes, setting a new men’s course record in the process.
For spectators tracking the runners online, Hall’s profile showed him holding a Just Stop Oil banner – which he later unfurled upon crossing the finish line.

— Christopher Whitby (@commanderwhitby) January 19, 2023
“This all just feels so urgent,” Hall explains, “my sport is very niche, but there are moments where it might get a little bit of publicity… I guess I’m just desperate and trying to use those moments.”
It was the 2019 Extinction Rebellion protests in London that spurred the father-of-two down this path, catching his attention with their colourful and vibrant nature before driving home the severity of the climate crisis.
“We’ve all seen headlines about polar bears and melting glaciers for years, but it was difficult sometimes to connect that to your life. So those protests made me start to realise how urgent things were and how governments really weren’t acting,” Hall says.
“I also started questioning myself as an athlete,” he continues, “as an elite ultramarathon runner I would fly to on average probably three big, international races a year – in fact in 2019 I flew five times return and hadn’t really given that significant thought.”
Cutting down on flights and picking ethical sponsors
Now, Hall hasn’t flown for three years – opting for domestic races and international events accessible by greener modes of transport. He’s part of a small but growing field of athletes turning down opportunities to compete abroad. Despite having a list of events he’d always wanted to do – such as one on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean – he says he now “can’t justify that to myself.”
One of Great Britain’s leading junior athletes, Innes FitzGerald, recently made headlines after declining to compete in Australia because of the environmental impact of travelling halfway around the world.
“The reality of the travel fills me with deep concern,” she said in a letter to British Athletics. “I was just nine when the COP21 Paris climate agreement was signed. Now, eight years on, global emissions have been steadily increasing, sending us on a path to climate catastrophe.”
However, Hall hasn’t written off flying entirely.
“I don’t think I should have to sacrifice my entire career,” he says, explaining that there are a handful of key races – largely in the US – that he still hopes to do.
It’s also through his sponsors where Hall feels he can help effect real change. He’s meticulous about the companies he partners with, turning down sponsorships and funding when organisations aren’t engaging meaningfully with environmental issues.
“I thought it would make me kind of unpopular, but it’s actually sort of had the opposite effect,” he explains, “I’ve found some companies have approached me because they want to work with me because of my ethics.”
Though Hall is extremely humble about his impact, the kind of companies he deals with are sometimes major sportswear manufacturers and suppliers.
“It’s nudging for systemic change that is going to have the most impact.”",<urn:uuid:4fcfb300-b3cc-4052-a04a-f7fa028e40c2>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://ecodaily.org/featured/sport-is-both-a-climate-victim-and-villain-these-champions-show-theres-another-way/,2024-02-20T21:51:11Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9655871391296387,2310,3.284682273864746,3
"THE THREE O’CLOCK PRAYER (JOHN 19:27-30) The Three O’clock Prayer is a verbal icon or summary of the Marianist spirit. Simple and unassuming as may be, this prayer not only captures the deepest memories of the Christian faith, but it also conveys the particular spirit that continues to inspire the members of the Family of Mary. It recalls the death of Jesus Christ as it is rendered in John 19:27-30. Daily the Marianists pause at 3:00 p.m. to recall their alliance with Jesus and Mary and to renew their dedication with this prayer: Lord Jesus, we gather in spirit at the foot of the cross with your Mother and the disciple whom you loved. We ask your pardon for our sins, which are the cause of your death. We thank you for having thought of us in that hour of salvation and for giving us Mary as our Mother. Holy Virgin, take us under your protection and open us to the action of the Holy Spirit. St. John, obtain for us the grace of taking Mary into our lives as, you did, and of assisting her in her mission. May the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit be glorified in all places through the Immaculate Virgin Mary. Amen. The upper half of the bas-relief establishes the connection between the Three O'Clock Prayer and the crucifixion scene. The huddled figures on the lower half represent Mary and St. John, and all those who ""gathered in spirit at the foot of the cross"" to commemorate Christ's death.

"In the State-of-the-Union, President Obama said, “Our deficits–cut by more than half.”
Looking at the federal deficit as a percent of GDP, we can say that the deficit is much lower than 4 years ago.
The deficit was an unusually large proportion of the GDP during the Great Recession (Dec. 2007-June 2009). It included more than $800 billion for stimulus spending and assorted bailout packages. With little effort because the special spending ended, we appear to have just returned to normal.
Deficits will probably increase again because of rising interest rates and the baby boomers. Higher interest rates mean the government has to pay more to borrow. Meanwhile, the baby boomer generation will collect historic highs from Social Security and Medicare.
AS A RESULT…
This is what the CBO projects:
I wonder whether saying we have halved the deficit returns us to fractal mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. Yes, we can look at the coast of Great Britain from afar and see a lovely uninterrupted curving line. But move in to a closer view and the hazardous jagged zigs and zags start to appear.
Sources and Resources: Discussing “Pinocchios” from the President’s State-of-the-Union address, the Washington Post cited the deficit halving quote. For the facts behind the quote and the source of my graphs, I recommend the new CBO report (above graphs) on the deficit. Finally, I do suggest looking at “Mixing Vice and Virtue: Combining the Immediacy Effect and the Diversification Heuristic.” Much better than its title, the paper’s video examples provide insight about our Netflix queues, the subprime mortgage crisis and our ballooning federal debt.",<urn:uuid:997ade7b-e010-4c0d-bc73-e89e7fddc9a9>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://econlife.com/2014/01/the-federal-deficit-remains-large/,2024-02-20T22:26:48Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.927698016166687,370,2.0994982719421387,2

How to Plan a Home Solar Electric System
Given the tons of benefits it affords you — solar energy is the future.
So you will be making the right decision if you choose to power your home with solar energy. However, powering your home with solar energy will require some amount of planning if everything is to go just the way you want it.
Thankfully, we know a thing or two about the nuts and bolts of getting solar energy to your abode.
Determine Your Home’s Energy Efficiency
This is the first step to take when you are looking to install solar energy because it is a key part of your plan. The aim is to determine if you need to upgrade the energy efficiency of your home. Take time to figure your total electric usage. This will help you decide if you need a home solar system. Here’s how you can determine the energy efficiency of your home:
- Carry out a home energy audit which should help you see how you expend energy so you can decide if you are losing electricity unnecessarily.
- Take a look at your appliances. You might need to eliminate the use of some or just replace others with high-efficiency models. You also want to ensure that you are using energy-efficient lighting.
- Do you use a cooling and heating system? If weatherizing your home feasible? If not, what are the options you have? HVAC systems consume a lot of energy in case you didn’t know.
The next step in planning a home solar system is to examine your home’s solar potential. Specifically, how power will be generated from the sites available. Luckily, there are lots of tools that can enable you to gauge the solar potential of your home. You must do this because not all homes are suitable for solar, and your home might be one of those homes.
Another option is to engage the services of a professional solar installer to help you with this. Gauging your home’s solar potential will require you to ascertain the following:
Your roof: Does it need to be replaced? If yes, then how soon do you need to do this? Solar panels need sturdy roofs. You will want to consider the age of your roof and whether or not it will need to be replaced. If you think that you will need to replace your roof in the next couple of years, you will need to go ahead and do that before you attach rooftop solar.
Shade trees: Are there any around your home? Shade trees will reduce the amount of light that solar panels receive. So it’s important to take a look at where you plan to put your solar system.
Your Local Home Owners Association: Will they permit a solar system in your home? What are the stipulations guiding solar panel systems in your neighborhood?
What Are the Options for Using Solar
Nowadays, there are several options that will allow you to enjoy solar energy in your home — even if you do not want to rent or purchase a rooftop system. Here are the available options:
- Shared solar: In this scenario, people can share solar energy using virtual net metering.
- Solar leases: Here, you can lease a solar system if you can’t afford one.
- Solarize program: This program allows you to get a discount system or participate in one.
- Switch energy suppliers to get green energy (if you’re in a deregulated state).
- Power purchase agreement: This involves a third party agreement wherein you get solar energy from a party that places the equipment on your home.
Do Your Research
The next step is to find out where you can get the best service when it’s time to install a home solar system. It’s vital to do your research about the experts in solar-generated power near you. There are no cutting corners here. Only the best will do when you are looking to invest in solar power. So do your research. Always ask for proof of certification from the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners.
Bear the following questions in mind when you are at this stage:
- How much does the outfit know about local building permits and interconnections?
- Can you get references from other people?
- What is their warranty like?
It also makes sense to ensure that the company does not have any liens or active judgments. Check the Better Business Bureau or your state’s electricity board for this information.
There are lots of solar financing options and incentives (like tax credits, for example) available to those looking to get a home solar system. Try to understand as much as possible about the incentives that are available to you.
You can get as much information as you want about available incentives from the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency.
Making Your Decision
This is where you decide if you are to get a professional service or just go the DIY route. The latter option is certainly a possibility. All you need is to do some more research on the kind of solar PV tools you need, the size of panels to install, and how to install them.
Whatever your decision, be sure to stay on the right side of the local laws.
By following the steps described above on planning a home solar system, you’ll be able to get your home powered with solar energy in no time.

6. Channel SEO
YouTube SEO is a set of concrete, actionable steps that you can do to improve your YouTube videos to rank better in search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing, as well as inside the YouTube platform via YouTube search engine optimization and recommended video (or related video) optimization.
SEO strategies for YouTube are increasingly being implemented by brands. You’d certainly want to be at the top of the search results for the largest video platform on the internet, wouldn’t you?

In order to maximize the number of views that the videos you upload to YouTube, it’s essential to optimize your videos for search engines. So when people search terms related to the content on your YouTube channel, your videos show up in those search engine results. Search engines give excellent content exposure, especially when you’re first starting out on YouTube. The majority of your traffic is probably going to come from Google search engine or Bing search engine.
Here are the main SEO elements that contribute to ranking in search engines.
Do you think Youtube SEO starts when you upload a video? No, it actually starts before you even record your video.
The first step is that you do a little research on the competition and discover good relevant keywords. While doing research, keep an eye on anyone else who has made the same video, their video title, the video thumbnail they use, and most importantly, what their targeted keyword is.
A personal perspective, more flashy B roll shots, or just a unique flare that offers new or different value to your target audience to help your video stand out. This will help to bring something new to the table even if the video you want already exists.
Next step, you need to find relevant keywords – the youtube keyword research.
Good keywords are keywords that don’t have a lot of competition but are heavily searched. To find these, can use the keyword Explorer tool with Ahrefs to see how your potential keywords rank, as well as see their competition, search volume, and optimization strengths and even copy competitor keywords.
In Keyword Research you should divide them into two categories, your primary keyword and your related keywords. Your primary keyword is the main keyword you’re hoping to rank for and should be the strongest keyword with the best score. All your other keywords are your related keywords that will support the main target keyword by being variations of that keyword.
You should incorporate it in your video by saying it at least once. And it’s even great if you can incorporate other keywords as well.
Google has developed the technology to listen to what’s being said in your video. Therefore, by including the main keyword or other relevant keywords in your video that you discovered during your research, you’re actually considerably enhancing your video’s SEO.
Multiple usages of a video will communicate to the algorithm that your video is primarily focused on that keyword. In fact, this is the most efficient strategy to rank your videos in search results, which is why you must do keyword research before recording in order to significantly improve your video’s SEO.
Your thumbnails are the first impression prospective viewers get of your content, making them perhaps one of the most significant aspects of your video’s SEO. If your video thumbnails are mediocre, you will not get clicks. And if you don’t get clicks, you won’t be ranked in search results for long.
A great thumbnail often comprises of two essential parts.
Action, emotion, suspense, or a preview of what the viewer may anticipate finding out are often the elements in thumbnail photos that attract the greatest attention. Images of people’s faces in close-up that exhibit a great deal of emotion tend to get more clicks. However, if your video incorporates sports, travel, or pranks, you will likely need a picture with more activity.
These thumbnails should leave the visitor wanting to know what occurs next to or tempt them to explore further.
If you’re creating a how-to or product review video, your thumbnail should highlight the product, food, item, or thing that your viewers can expect to learn more about. Therefore, before shooting your YouTube video, consider the thumbnail. If possible, schedule time during your session to take a photo specifically for it. This will always be more fascinating than just taking a still from your video.
Thumbnails are often rather small, particularly on mobile devices. Therefore, it is recommended to use text that is large and simple to read. Remember that less is more, and limit your material to as few words as feasible. Two to four words are optimal. Pro-tip. Capitalized and bold fonts are easy to read on thumbnail images.
The title of your video is the second line of defense when it comes to getting clicks, and it’s also crucial for ranking and search. You might think of the combination of your video title and thumbnail as your elevator pitch. The concept behind an elevator pitch is that you have exactly 30 seconds to hook anybody you’re selling to in an elevator. However, you only have around three seconds on YouTube. Unfortunately, you cannot engage a viewer if your video does not appear in search results.
Now, for example, the target keyword is the best SEO agency Kochi. To ensure that we rank high for this keyword, we should place it at the beginning of the YouTube video titles. By adding your target keyword at the beginning of your video, you’re letting YouTube know what your video is about and significantly boosting your SEO.
Your video title should pique the viewer’s curiosity and encourage them to watch your video. It is exactly like a teaser trailer for a film. You want it to be detailed so that viewers understand the purpose of your video. You should also be precise since deceiving viewers with clickbait names that promise something entirely different from the actual content of your video will drastically harm your SEO.
This will certainly result in a significant decline in views within the first 10 seconds, as viewers will immediately recognize that the video does not match the title. YouTube will note this in your video’s statistics, and as a result, your video will no longer rank for those keywords. So always make sure your title conveys the right content.
And finally, one more SEO suggestion regarding your titles. You should ensure that your title has between 20 and 70 characters. This is due to the fact that anything fewer than 20 characters may not be descriptive enough for both prospective viewers and the YouTube algorithm, and anything greater than 70 characters is likely to be shortened, making it more difficult to read. Now that you are aware of these SEO tactics, your video’s elevator pitch is certain to take off.
Similar to a newspaper, your video’s descriptions should provide viewers with details about your video. Similar to a newspaper, your video descriptions should provide viewers with information. However, it is also capable of much more. It tells the YouTube algorithm what your video is about so that it can show it to prospective viewers in search results and recommended videos. So let’s go through some crucial SEO tactics you can use to boost the description of your video.
First up, let’s talk length. YouTube permits video descriptions of up to 5,000 characters. However, many new YouTubers do not take advantage of this. Given that the video description is the greatest portion where text may be used, lengthier descriptions are usually preferable. If possible, strive for between 150 and 500 words since the more text you provide here, the more information you provide on YouTube about your video.
Similar to the script of your video, your video’s description is another chance to optimize your SEO by using keywords. Try to integrate as many of your video’s keywords as naturally as possible into the video description. This will improve your SEO while maintaining a pleasant reading experience. It is essential to keep in mind, however, that the video description section is not the place for a lengthy list of keywords. This is really against YouTube’s community standards and makes your description appears like a rubbish heap. Place these keywords instead in the Tags section.
Keep in mind that the beginning of your video description will be shown in search engine results. Therefore it is essential that the first few phrases be powerful and include your target keyword. Again, attempt to insert your keyword naturally, without it sounding forced. Next, let’s discuss what YouTube refers to as below the fold, which is the portion of your video description that becomes visible when a user clicks the Show More button.
The space below the fold contains the bulk of your description, but it is also a chance to provide links to direct visitors. Links to items you may be reviewing, other social media profiles, affiliate links, and more are always welcome. Lastly, you should use YouTube’s new hashtags at the end of your video description to improve your SEO.
Again, you should ensure that they are related to the subject of your video. YouTube will then show these hashtags above the title of your video. You may now put more than three hashtags in your video description, but YouTube will only display up to three hashtags above the title. Keep in mind that if you add more than 15 hashtags to the description of your video, the YouTube algorithm will really disregard them entirely.
What do you believe this to be, Instagram or something? It’s also worth mentioning that you may use hashtags directly in your video’s title, but we wouldn’t advocate doing so since it looks awkward and is sometimes frowned upon on YouTube. So, there you have it: every description of SEO advice imaginable.
Adding chapters to your YouTube videos may significantly boost the user experience and, therefore, the brand experience of your audience. Particularly if you have lengthier videos, we believe it is a good idea to have chapters. Let’s see how we can do this.
Adding chapters to YouTube videos is a simple process. You only need to provide the description, and then you will state the chapter’s title. Therefore, we may just state chapter one. Then, after you have this information, you will just input the chapter’s beginning timestamp. So, chapter one may begin at zero minutes and five seconds, for example, and this would be repeated for each chapter. And you should ensure that the timestamp follows the chapter’s title.
Subtitles are often regarded as a type of accessibility, which is certainly a positive trait, but they also serve as a sort of hidden SEO. And if you’ve already conducted keyword research and vocally incorporated it into your video, your subtitles will be chock-full of all those excellent keywords, allowing YouTube to better offer you to viewers who are searching for similar subjects. Currently, YouTube automatically generates subtitles for your videos.
First, the automatic subtitles don’t always get all the words right, resulting in sometimes-confusing word jumbles. This may have a negative impact on your video since it may provide YouTube’s algorithm with incorrect keywords and position you in irrelevant search results.
Second, the automatic subtitles have not yet mastered proper grammar. The majority of the time, they end up as run-on sentences, where you cannot tell where one phrase ends, and another starts since there are no periods or capital letters. Therefore, utilizing correctly designed subtitles and captions might make them simpler to read for those who need them.
#3 Thirdly, often, if the audio quality of a video is poor, the automatic subtitles won’t add anything for that area, resulting in missing subtitles for large sections of the video.
Now let’s go through a few quick tips on how you can improve your channel’s SEO.
First is the name of your channel. If you already have an established channel name, this may come as a surprise, but your channel name might be a wonderful spot to include a keyword or two. The next step is channel keywords. Now, you may have believed that keywords were exclusively for your videos, but they can also be utilized for your whole channel.
In YouTube Studio, you may input channel keywords by clicking Settings and choosing the Channel tab. You may include as many keywords here that are related to the content of your channel.
The About Page of your channel is a useful but often overlooked location to add keywords. Your About Page section is an excellent spot to promote your channel to your audience by describing the benefits they may expect from subscribing. But it’s much better if you can fill it with relevant keywords, so don’t leave this part blank.
If you want to attract a larger audience on YouTube, you should connect your website with your social media accounts and enter contact information for all of these in the channel’s basic details section, which will display channel art in the right-hand corner.
If you provide a service or product via the channel, it will increase the trustworthiness of your brand in the eyes of the intended audience and boost the overall value of your brand.
Playlist descriptions are sometimes disregarded, yet they are another hidden SEO layer where keywords may be included. To add a playlist description in YouTube Studio, choose the Playlist tab. Click the pencil symbol while hovering over the playlist you want to write a description to. Once on your playlist’s page, click the pencil symbol next to the absence of a description to make one, and don’t forget to incorporate keywords organically.
Your YouTube channel trailer is a promo for your YouTube channel. It is a 60-second or less video that shows viewers what they can expect from your YouTube channel. A compelling YouTube Channel Trailer will persuade prospective subscribers to subscribe and see further videos on your channel.
YouTube Channel trailers are essential for SEO. The video informs viewers about the material they can expect to see on your channel and may be used to connect with individuals who are interested in viewing similar videos.
The featured video is mostly used for returning subscribers. YouTube’s homepage contains popular videos, which may be a terrific way to expose your video to millions of people. YouTube’s featured videos can help your video rank higher when someone searches for relevant keywords.
Regular Community Posts are essential for YouTube SEO since they indicate to Google that you are actively engaged with the platform. This is a chance to reach out to other creators and brands with your audience, even if you have fewer subscribers.
On YouTube, user engagement may not seem to be SEO, but it is. Because YouTube likes it when people continue to watch and interact with your videos on the platform. If the algorithm observes that viewers are binge-watching, commenting, and liking your videos, it will be more likely to promote your material to them in related videos or search results.
#1 YouTube’s objective is to keep users on the site longer; thus, it is to your best advantage to make longer videos. It is well acknowledged that videos longer than 10 minutes tend to do better in search. In order to suit YouTube’s algorithm, you should create lengthier videos. Just make sure you keep them entertaining to watch, or you can lose people.
#2 End screens. End screens are links that appear in the last 20 seconds of a video and enable viewers to continue binge-watching. YouTube enables you to include more videos, playlists, a Subscribe button, and connections to other channels and affiliate websites to which you may choose to direct visitors.
However, bear in mind that YouTube prefers to retain users on the platform. Therefore, we propose placing a Subscribe button beside one or two more videos. Also, remember that you may choose to have YouTube automatically determine which of your videos is optimal for your audience. Consider using this as one of your available video options.
#3 Next, to the end screens, are cards. Cards, unlike end screens, may appear at any time throughout a video. Similarly, it is possible to add a card for a video, playlist, channel, or affiliate website. Now cards are most effective when you bring the user’s attention to them by naming them or pointing to them in your video.
As they might become annoying for your viewers, restrict yourself to no more than three cards for each video. Also, you do not want to divert visitors away from the opening of your video. Therefore, put cards in the latter portion of your video or when they are very relevant.
#4 And finally, CTA’s. Similar to keywords, you should include call-to-actions in your videos to encourage viewers to interact with your material by commenting, liking, or subscribing. User engagement is a key measure used by YouTube’s algorithm to determine whether or not your material is good. If your comments and likes section pops up often, YouTube will be more likely to promote your videos in similar videos and search results.
You may include calls-to-action by posing a question that viewers can respond to in the comments, requesting that they like a video, or proposing that they subscribe to your channel if they like your material. As a result, people will feel as though they are supporting you. Some YouTubers choose to place this at the beginning of their videos, while others prefer to place it towards the conclusion.
Try a mix of all strategies to determine what works best.
Here are some free SEO tools for budget-conscious YouTubers.
Keywords Everywhere is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that provides YouTube search analytics, trend charts, and tag data for free. Note, however, that certain services are only available for a fee, although they do offer pay-as-you-go options that may be more economical for you.
You may use Google Trends to see if a certain topic is trending on Google, and you can also filter it for YouTube searches. In addition, you may compare it to other terms to see which is better, as well as scroll down to view geographic statistics and other keywords that are relevant.
You may evaluate keywords or video titles by putting them into YouTube’s search box and seeing what related search queries show. Additionally, you may use the search results to discover popular video titles. So there you have it: three free SEO tools that are simply waiting for you to avoid spending money on them.
Remember that all of the above elements help YouTube identify what your video is about. YouTube – Their first game is relevancy. Your file name should contain your primary keyword; your video content should have your main keyword, your description and video tags should include your related keywords and keyphrases, etc.
Once you publish your youtube video, share it on relevant platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Reddit and other video sharing platforms.
However, a word of warning about Reddit: DO NOT spam there. You will be expelled from that group. Instead of attempting to control a discussion, you should establish rapport, interact with others, and contribute to it. Do not act as an insurance salesperson at a Reddit party.
In addition, you do not have to use all of these sites. You should focus on the channels you’re already utilizing and spend more time developing YouTube content as opposed to acquiring new Snapchat followers.
Twitter is the lone exception to this rule. Google indexes tweets, so if you tweet a link to your YouTube video, Google will instantly notice and record the connection. Bringing a Twitter user to a Google platform is similar to giving Google a pat on the back.
Show to YouTube that you’re not merely releasing your Youtube video and walking away but that you’re actively promoting it. But do not jut waste countless hours distributing this link. Get in, get around, and return to creating content!
Utilizing YouTube analytics and tracking important data is a fundamental method for increasing your YouTube videos’ ranking. By monitoring YouTube video analytics, you may have a deeper understanding of how viewers see your videos, how they discover your videos, and how engaged they are with the video.
YouTube provides several perspectives on gathered data, which enables you to expand your channel gradually by optimizing each video.
Key YouTube analytics metrics you must follow to enhance your channel and videos:
Your greatest chance of achieving success on YouTube is to understand the engagement metrics of your videos. Each time you create a video, testing different factors helps you determine the most effective methods to communicate with your audience.
You must execute a plan that involves testing and assessing new methods to communicate with your audience, enhance your call-to-actions, and maintain your audience’s retention as high as possible.
Some indicators are more important than others, but data as a whole should never be neglected since new possibilities may arise unexpectedly.
We believe you realize at this time that relevance and engagement are critical. First, you must do keyword research. You must produce relevant videos that directly address people’s most pressing concerns. You must produce the material. You must include your keyword anywhere possible. Ensure that it is created in one sense for search engines and in another for relevance to your customer avatar.
Therefore, the opening 20 seconds of your video should be very engaging and captivating. It makes a bold promise about what the video will include, then delivers on that promise in the video.
Now that you are aware of all YouTube SEO best practices, keep in mind that being a YouTuber may be tedious. So remember to take frequent rests and deep breaths. Seriously, you do not want to exhaust yourself. Moreover, don’t forget to continue learning since YouTube is always evolving.

"Individuals search is one of the most well known subjects on the web, drawing a great deal of enthusiasm with individuals needing to research individuals of intrigue or only inquisitive about their companions, neighbors, potential accomplices or individuals they may despise.

"The ability of 10-11-year -old children to identify basic tastes and their liking towards unfamiliar foods
The involvement of children in sensory evaluation and consumer research continues to increase and has become crucial in the food industry, as children sensory perceptions differ from adults. Research on basic taste sensitivity in children provides contradictory results, with most of the studies not considering the familiarity aspect of the food samples. Familiarity can lead children to memories of the food which are able to influence their taste perception and liking. This study aims to investigate the ability of 10 to 11-year old children in identifying sweetness, saltiness, sourness, and bitterness in unfamiliar food samples. The taste identification data was collected from 98 children using 19 food samples representing the four basic tastes of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. For each food sample, the children evaluated their familiarity, the basic taste(s) they perceived using the check-all-that-apply (CATA) method and scored their liking. Their basic taste identification ability was investigated by comparing their results to trained panellists as a reference. The food samples were unfamiliar to most of the children (never tasted by 85% of the children on average). Correspondence Analysis (CA) showed that children were able to identify the basic tastes of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter in the unfamiliar foods, with a high congruency to the trained panellists. However, children’s identification ability was lower when combinations of dominant basic tastes occurred. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated a positive correlation between the presence of sweet taste and the children’s liking while sour and bitter tastes showed the opposite.",<urn:uuid:f34d30ed-07f5-4b6e-b2cf-1b92f5e78c74>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://edulia.eu/?publication=the-ability-of-10-11-year-old-children-to-identify-basic-tastes-and-their-liking-towards-unfamiliar-foods-73,2024-02-20T22:45:44Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.95967036485672,334,3.540315628051758,4

"The database that our software is based on offers two main choices to users: mechanical/plumbing or electrical. Within these trade-based databases there are categories and subcategories for all commonly-used items, making it easy for users to find what they need for a job.
The great thing about a well-maintained and industry-specific estimating database is that it saves you time and effort simultaneously. There’s no need to waste time searching through lists of irrelevant items like you would have to in a generic database. Without knowing the specific code or name of an item, you can easily find each one in a logical place by clicking through headings and groups.
Our database is also set up with assemblies (also commonly referred to as kits or composites) which serve as shortcuts whenever you need to add a combination of multiple items into your project. These can be custom built based on what you usually use in your business.
We’ve selected the product ranges in our database very carefully over the years. Commonly requested manufacturers and suppliers have been added as required. This has brought us to the point where we have a fantastic range to choose from and an unrivalled level of detail for each item. This includes up-to-date prices and accurate average labour times for every single item, a rare advantage offered by very few providers.

"Is the term ‘compassionate economy’ an oxymoron?
When people think about the economy, they usually think of decisions about investment, markets, or numbers on electronic charts. Maybe they have an image of people – probably suited men – in a boardroom taking decisions about closing factories or increasing the CEO’s pay. Or they picture frantic shouting and hand waving on the stock exchange floor.
Compassion is not usually part of such images and connotations.
Yet how we provide for each other and distribute resources – the essence of economy – is a terrain in sore need of compassion. Decisions taken about pay, prices, investment, and about what ‘counts’ have consequences far beyond the rooms they were taken in. These decisions shape what sort of economy prevails, and this in turn, shapes whether people and planet flourish and thrive or struggle to survive.
So far, the result of those decisions has generated an economy that is not only not working for enough people, but is pushing the planet beyond what she can handle. There is ample evidence that the way things are operating today needs to change: from the warnings of scientists that acting to address environmental breakdown is beyond urgent, to communities across the globe who all-too often face precariousness and struggle navigating the impact of decisions taken elsewhere. The 2022 UN Human Development Report describes ‘three volatile and interacting strands: the destabilizing planetary pressures and inequalities of the Anthropocene, the pursuit of sweeping societal transformations to ease those pressures and the widespread and intensifying polarization’.
It is the economy, not the world, that lacks compassion
There is a fear that humanity has lost its way, and that people crave the wrong things. This implies that the existential crisis facing the world emerges from people writ large. Looking at these crises, some call for a shift in people’s values. The assumption then seems to be that if people change, one-by-one, then things will get better, things will not be so dangerous, and our planet will not be so precariously close to being pushed beyond her limits.
What this calculation doesn’t take account of is the swathes of evidence that people’s values are already largely aligned with what humanity and the planet need (see here for a collection of research and here). Instead, it is the economy that is misaligned. Poll after poll of public opinion indicates that people, around the world, want the post-Covid world to be one where health and the planet are elevated above goals such as economic growth. These polls are underscored by rich participatory deliberations such as Citizens Assemblies. And these articulations of what humans want and most value are, in turn, reinforced by the findings of psychologists, sociologists, neuroscientists, and scholars in development and human need.
Distilling the messages from these diverse quarters leads to a picture of what people need: trust and cooperation in relationships; security and sufficiency in work and income; purpose and dignity in how time is spent; and presence in healthy environments.
But what has happened is not so much that people’s values have gone awry, but the way the economy has been designed – dependent on growth and its success largely measured by GDP – is like a heavy cloak laying across these values, masking and undermining them. So these human needs – familiar across cultures, locations and politics – are inhibited, at best, by an economy which is constructed with 20th century thinking, which judges itself against measures that contain many perverse incentives, and which treats people and the planet as mere factors of production.
So is it surprising that people, faced with an economy so misaligned to their needs, reach for coping mechanisms – at the shopping mall, the gym, the pill box or the ballot box?
Is it surprising that people, with their profound and ingrained need to belong and avoid shame, grasp for control of their image, as economic hierarchies so harshly translate into social hierarchies?
Is it surprising that in a world of rapid change, sound bites, twitter bubbles, and insecurity about the future, that people look to steady their own identities and hold onto what they know?
Can economic change and compassion chime together?
So, it is not necessarily that people have lost their compassion, but that the economy of today, built up over several decades, has trampled over people’s values.
Nor is it that people make bad choices as individuals, but they are constrained by their contexts and circumstances from building the lives they want to live.
What could – needs to – emerge instead?
What is needed is an economy fit for the 21st century, designed with compassion (as in understanding others’ needs and working to deliver them), not extraction at its heart, and thus aligned with what people and planet need.
This compassionate economy would speak to the common core messages contained in a diversity of voices calling for a different sort of economy: encapsulated by the idea of a wellbeing economy. Whether regenerative economics, solidarity economics, doughnut economics, buen vivir, degrowth, participatory economics, economies for the common good, and so on, they all add brushstrokes to a beautiful and rich alternative vision to the economy of today that sucks so much life out of people and planet.
When it comes to individual businesses, the idea of compassion entails that instead of
giving back what we’ve received, we need to give first…We need companies set up with the purpose of returning to the integrity of humanity and caring for our planet…Allowing the profit-motive to be supreme is unbalanced: it tips the scales against humanity and the planet. We need to find a new role for business in which…it also builds a healthier society.
Getting there is going to involve a plethora of changes: in business models, tax systems, product design, pricing mechanisms, distribution of paid work, valuing of unpaid work, procurement, planning, metrics, bureaucratic systems, governmental budgeting and so on. A 1000+ piece jigsaw puzzle.
Clustering the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle into four corners ‘4Ps’ (Purpose, Prevention, Predistribution, and People Powered) can help make sense of the task of system change:
- Purpose: This is about realigning the goal of the economy and the entities that comprise it with the needs of people and planet. Think of the gathering momentum of the ‘Beyond GDP’ movement or the fact that over half of OECD countries have multidimensional wellbeing frameworks. Outcomes budgeting – that look at what is being achieved, rather than just what is being spent and done – is another example.
- Prevention: Tackling things at their root cause is better than constantly putting sticking plasters on the damage done. This is about asking why a problem emerged? And keep asking ‘Why?’ until the upstream drivers are understood and then designing and delivering action there. The more circular an economy, the less need for beach clean ups; the more people can earn enough to live on, the less need for food banks and tax credits to top up wages; and so on.
- Predistribution: This is about getting the economy to do more of the heavy lifting, so less government intervention is necessary to redistribute between rich and poor. Businesses whose mission is something other than short term profit are vital; wage ratios, Living Wages, community wealth building, and flourishing local enterprises also fit near this corner.
- People Powered: Putting people at the forefront of shaping economic systems is the only antidote to an economy designed by and for a narrow group who do very well out of the current state-of-affairs. Who is at the table when budgets are designed? When economic strategies are written? When policies are prioritised?
Tangible examples of each of these pieces of the jigsaw are not hard to find: for Purpose look at New Zealand’s wellbeing budget or Scotland’s National Performance Framework. For Prevention businesses moving to 4-day weeks or six-hour days and the Government of the State of Victoria embedding early intervention show changes are entirely do-able. For Predistribution, there are worker cooperatives such as the global engineering firm Arup, and in the UK businesses such as John Lewis and GoApe where workers are partners and the purpose of the enterprise is to deliver benefits for them. The community wealth building efforts of towns such as Preston in north England or Cleveland in the US show how to keep money circulating locally. Participatory budgeting is happening from New York to Brazil and citizens assemblies being used in France, Scotland, Ireland and beyond to bring deliberative conversations to the heart of government decision making and make it just a little more people powered.
Compassion means upstream economic change
Perhaps it is time to stop blaming people for bad choices or the wrong values, and instead view their situation through compassionate lenses. Doing so will bring firmly into view the structures of the economy that shape and constrain choices.

A young woman from Norway, 24-year-old Marte Deborah Dalelv, naively thought she could do the same in Dubai, but was shocked to learn that what passes for ""rape"" in Norway is criminal conduct for women in Dubai. The courts in Dubai didn't agree that her story constitutes rape, and sentenced her instead to 16 months in prison for fornication and drinking alcohol. This case was first widely publicized here in Norway, and now CNN reports it as well. It beautifully showcases the entitlement of feminist women to have all their regretted sex prosecuted as rape. And it also predictably brought the manginas of Norwegian politics out of the woodwork, who vehemently protest this verdict while they are perfectly happy to imprison men for false rape in Norway. In short, this case highlights all the reasons why I became an MRA: Normal male sexuality makes us all rapists in the eyes of the law, and the entire system here conspires to promote this misandry.
One side of a story is almost never accurate, and here we only have the woman's story quoted. Even so, Marte's story does not add up to rape even if she is telling nothing but the truth. She describes only token resistance in going to the man's hotel room before willingly going to bed with him, and then blacks out and implies no resistance at all until she has her regrets the next morning as she wakes up naked. There is no violence; only drunkenness and regret. The case could hardly be more stereotypical of regretted drunken sex redefined in retrospect as rape thanks to feminist rape law -- minus the feminist law. The accused rapist is just a normal, persistent man, behaving like I have done many times and any of us would. Only with perverse, misandristic laws can this be rape, and I am pleased that Dubai rejects the hateful precepts of feminist rape law that Marte thought she could get away with.
Marte Deborah Dalelv was at worst taken advantage of while drunk and careless, like any normal man would do, but she was not raped. I am happy that she is now experiencing a backlash for her hateful attitude that she is entitled to have men imprisoned for our normal male sexuality.
Remember also that admitting it was not rape amounts to confessing to the crimes she is convicted of, so she has a powerful incentive to remain a false accuser, even as she probably understands by now that she made a foolish mistake by calling the police.
In Norway a woman is never at fault for her actions, no matter how irresponsible. If a woman has any sexual regret at all, for any reason whatsoever, a man is always guilty of rape. Kudos to Dubai for standing up to this feminist ideal. While I am no fan of the sex-hostile moralism of Sharia law, their system is clearly superior to ours and admirably equitable. I don't agree with criminalizing fornication. But if we must have so repressive laws, it is much fairer to hold the woman responsible along with the man in cases of regretted sex (and in this case the man was sentenced to prison as well, just not for rape). Sharia law is the lesser of two evils. Rather than institutionalizing false victimhood like feminist law does, it holds both sexes accountable to rigid moral standards. I would take excessive moralism over excessive misandry any day. Thus, as an MRA, I applaud Dubai and I welcome Islamization of Europe too, over feminism at any rate.",<urn:uuid:f4e4a3fc-3e98-4a2d-96ac-d5970249ecde>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://eivindberge.blogspot.com/2013/07/feminist-rape-gets-reality-check-in.html?showComment=1374658306793,2024-02-20T22:39:12Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9733587503433228,768,1.133303165435791,1
"Children orphaned by AIDS in Uganda: Can they thrive under orphanage care?
University of Bergen
HIV and AIDS, orphaned children, orphanage care, thriving, Uganda
Care for orphaned children is one of the major challenges facing AIDS-affected communities. Usually orphaned children are cared for by extended families; alternative living arrangements may include orphanages and child-headed households. This study focuses on orphanage care to (1) identify coping strategies used by orphaned children to deal with various challenges and (2) explore ways in which orphanages contribute to orphaned children’s wellbeing. Twelve children living in an externally-funded, family-style orphanage were interviewed. Staff members from the same orphanage and from two other organizations caring for orphaned children (six in total) were interviewed. Challenges faced by the children included mourning the loss of parents, longing to meet relatives and stigmatization of HIV positive children. The children coped by drawing on their faith, making friends and by avoiding and ignoring. The children’s basic needs were well provided for by the orphanage but there was a gap in psychosocial support. Connections with relatives were lacking for several children.",<urn:uuid:ac43c255-6f47-45d9-8a3b-019a61ac38bb>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://ejournals.bib.uni-wuppertal.de/index.php/sws/article/view/458,2024-02-20T22:58:31Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9749061465263367,244,2.7808048725128174,3
"This research comparatively ranks OECD countries’ statutory policies of leave, early childhood education and care (ECEC), and flexible work arrangement, in terms of their levels of supportiveness and gender equality based on the Supportiveness and Gender Equality Indices. Among 33 countries, Sweden ranks 1st based on both Indices, while the United States ranks 30th for Supportiveness and 29th for Gender Equality. Mexico, Switzerland, and Turkey rank last for both Indices. Four types of policy regimes are identified. Among them, state-oriented caring regimes that challenge gendered opposition of paid work and unpaid care work through policy provisions are more likely to address work-family conflict, promote gender equality, and enhance child well-being. To better support working parents, leave would best be well paid and equally shared between fathers and mothers motivated by incentives; an entitlement to ECEC and flexibility has to be granted before or at the end of well-paid leave.",<urn:uuid:477e2fe5-dccc-4617-9ee0-92a4af90ee38>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://ejournals.bib.uni-wuppertal.de/index.php/sws/article/view/539,2024-02-20T21:57:53Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9680196046829224,190,2.3679206371307373,2
"On May 5, 2017, an injunction on City of St. Louis Ordinance No. 70078 was lifted raising the minimum wage in the City of St. Louis to $10 per hour. However in the waning hours of the Missouri 2017 legislative session, the Missouri General Assembly passed House Bill 1194, which prevents Missouri cities from establishing minimum age rates higher than the minimum wage set by the state.
Governor Greitens has announced that this legislation will proceed without his signature and will go into effect on August 28, 2017, preempting and nullifying any local law currently in place. Under this new law, the St. Louis City’s current $10 per hour minimum wage will revert back to the statewide minimum wage of $7.70 an hour.
Despite this impending law, covered employers must continue to comply with the $10 per hour minimum wage ordinance until the new law’s effective date: August 28, 2017. This also raises an interesting dilemma for employers who will have to decide whether to reduce the pay of its employees whose wages were increased to $10 per hour when Ordinance No. 70078 took effect in May. Under Missouri law, if an employer decides to reduce an employee’s wages, the employer must provide a 30-day advance written notice of the reduction in wages. Any company or corporation who violates this requirement shall pay $50 per affected employee, which can be recovered through court action.",<urn:uuid:e6cfc305-1d43-4601-8934-a52e6653af9b>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://elawlines.com/2017/07/07/new-legislation-renders-new-city-st-louis-minimum-wage-increase-short-lived,2024-02-20T21:49:18Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9585968255996704,291,1.8599138259887695,2

"3 Methods To Improve Your SEO Performance With User Personas
Digital marketing is a rapidly changing environment. New tricks and tips come up regularly while trends change. Among the tactics that turned out to be highly beneficial is the utilization of user personas.
If you have been in marketing for a while, then you have probably heard the term ""user persona"" before. It is a term that is not solely used in marketing but also in business, design, and other areas as well. Putting it plainly, a persona is a fictional character that represents your users. It also contains information valuable for marketing, sales, and technology.
In this article, we dig into the benefits of user personas in SEO performance. Read below to find out what they are, how to create, and how to implement these personas in your digital marketing strategy.
What Are User Personas?
The first step of our journey is to explain the term ""user persona."" The predominant definition of the term refers to it as the representative of your user. To define, a user persona is the archetypical user that represents a wider group of users. Hence, it contains characteristics, goals, and behaviors that are common among your users.
Typically, a buyer persona takes the form of a two-page document. In this document, you can find a detailed description of a representative user of your services. To make it clear, this description contains valuable insights into your customers that help you optimize your services and processes. Even though user personas differ per industry, some of the most common sections are the following.
In this section, the demographic information is presented. The most commonly seen information includes age, occupation, status, and location.
In certain cases, the character plays an important role in the buyer's behavior. Thus, some industries include personality traits such as friendliness, smartness, and flexibility.
What motivates the presented user in general? Could it be social recognition? Maybe power? In any case, this can be used to transfer your message effectively.
The general goals of the user are listed in bullet points. An example can be to reduce time in using something or even change a habit.
Frustrations of the user are also presented in bullet points. This is your chance to see the problem your service might solve.
Here you describe the familiarity of the user with technology. What devices does the buyer use? How familiar are they with the technology of your services?
A short bio includes the above-mentioned information in a paragraph. By writing a story about the user, you give life to the data you collected.
How To Create User Personas
Now that we have a better understanding of what a user persona is, let's make one for our business, shall we?
The process of creating user personas can be challenging. It requires a process of gathering and filtering information. However, this has to be done in a way that the gathered information creates a pattern of behavior towards your service. In this way, you will create the image of your users and act accordingly.
To shed more light on this, the steps of persona development are the following.
1. Collect Information
The initial and most important step of the process is data collection. To achieve the most accurate results, you need solid user persona research. This can be done in several ways and methods depending on the industry. Some of the most common are:
- Field Research
2. Filter Information
By default, the gathered raw data are of low value without proper filtering and visualization. Hence, in this stage, you might consider analyzing the information you obtained from your research. During your analysis, focus on patterns that explain certain behavior. In this way, you will be able to proceed to persona creation and understand your audience.
3. Create Personas
In this final step, you will put the analysis and persona ideas into action. To explain, you can use the filtered gathered information to create a visualization of the described user. This can be done in one to two pages. Make sure to include at least the sections we presented above.
Implementing Buyer Personas In Your SEO Strategy
Now that you have created your own user personas, it is time for action! The implementation phase can also be tricky, but if you follow the general SEO tips, then you will succeed.
As we previously mentioned, business personas are the representation of your main target groups. They contain valuable insights that will help you transfer your message successfully. By definition, these valuable insights can be applied to your SEO efforts in three different ways.
Tailor Your SEO Efforts To Your Personas
Tailoring your SEO efforts to your personas should be in the initial phases of your strategic marketing plan. While building your plan, you might want to consider the audience you are addressing. Let's not forget that this audience includes your potential customers.
Hence, take into consideration the personas you have created before you start building your plan. In this way, you will manage to optimize your SEO efforts and achieve the best possible performance.
To enhance even more your SEO initiatives, consider creating digital and non-digital user persona examples. In detail:
- Digital persona
A digital persona represents your online customer. So, it explains their buying journey and overall behavior towards your services. It offers valuable insights to help you optimize your website and increase your revenue.
- Non-digital persona
This persona goes beyond the boundaries of technology. It provides you with information regarding the real-life customer. Even if you offer only online services, this persona can still help you with information about general buying behavior and motivations.
Optimize Keyword Research
If you have been in marketing for a long time, then you know the value of solid keyword research. It is the compass of an SEO marketer. To clarify, keyword research is the process of searching and finding valuable keywords to target with your content. Ranking high on these keywords will often offer valuable organic traffic and potential leads.
Generally, keyword research is developed in three stages. These are brainstorming, filtering, and implementation. Let's dive deeper into the stages below and explain how buyer personas help in each one.
Brainstorming is the initial stage of keyword research. In this phase, the marketing team gathers together to decide on which keywords or search queries they should focus. The decision is usually the outcome of a thorough competitor analysis and market research. Hence, it is important to use every information on users to decide which keywords to target.
The importance of customer personas in the brainstorming phase is vital. In order to decide which keywords to target, you need to know what your target group is searching for. To put it plainly, you need to understand who your users are. These insights are presented in a user persona. Therefore, by applying user persona keywords in the brainstorming phase of your keyword research, you ensure the accuracy of search queries decided.
Now that you have your excel filled with valuable keywords, you need to filter them. Find patterns and categorize them accordingly. In this way, you will be able to decide which marketing initiatives should target which keywords.
Buyer personas are vital in the filtering process as well. The insights provided on your users can define which categories of keywords are important for your success. That said, you can sort keywords to target different personas effectively. For example, some users might be looking for tips and strategies or how-to guides on X topic. Also, other users might be looking for reviews, comparisons, or the best tools to do the X thing.
As you can understand, you can group keywords based on the buyer's journey (awareness stage, consideration stage, purchase stage).
You have uncovered the important keywords and filtered them according to the insights of your user personas. Now it is time to put them to action. In this final stage, you implement the keywords into your content marketing strategy. This is also the beginning of your marketing funnel for conversions on your website.
Can user personas affect the implementation phase? Well, yes but indirectly. Since you have created the landing pages for your target group, you might want to see how they work right? That is when the personas come into play. The insights you collected in the personas will guide you in creating your marketing funnels and testing the effectiveness of your content.
Hence, they will help you optimize your content, decrease the bounce rate, and increase conversions.
Alongside keyword research, link building is also vital for your SEO performance. To define, link building is the initiative you make to gather valuable backlinks to your website. To achieve this goal, you need a solid link building strategy.
How can user personas help with link building? Well, similarly to keyword research, you need to know who your potential customer is before you plan your effort. What do they like? Which blogs are they interested in? These are some of the typical questions to be answered prior to your link building initiatives. To clarify, developing user personas may increase your SEO performance by assisting in guest posting and link baiting.
One of the most effective ways of link building is guest posting. During guest posting, you are looking for websites that have a “write for us” section. Then you add your content and get a link from it directing to your website.
User personas arrive to optimize the guest posting process. Since you know who your users are, then you can find what they are interested in and write about it. The more precise and representative the persona is, the more likely it is to generate organic traffic to your website.
Also, have in mind that posting on other websites will help you increase your thought leadership and your circle of influence. For more tips on that, make sure to read our latest article on how to become an influencer.
The second most efficient link building tactic is to create a link bait. Basically, you do not always have to guest-post to get backlinks. If you already have content on your site, you can find relevant content on other websites as well. Then you implement an email outreach campaign asking for a link back to your article.
The importance of a user persona in this tactic is the relevance of content. Knowing what your users read, search, and discuss online will help you approach the right content. Additionally, if the insights can guide you to the perfect fit of blogs, then you can see to which other websites these blogs are linking to. These insights combined can help your link building strategy to reach its potential.
And remember, creating contextual links is very valuable for your SEO performance.
User personas are valuable assets for your business. They are the mirror of your customers. Both the insights and the visualization can eventually be beneficial in several aspects of your business. They include demographics, interests, motivations, and much more information about your users.
In terms of SEO performance, personas can have a large impact. That's how content marketers influence purchase decisions.
Let's not forget that the users are the core of your services. You want the specific target group that needs your services to find you online. What is better guidance in this than knowing exactly who your users are?
To recap, user personas are invaluable in SEO in three ways. Initially, you might consider tailoring all your SEO efforts around your personas to increase efficiency. Next, you need to take into consideration the user insights for successful keyword research and link building. When this information is combined with the proper SEO tactics, then you will meet your ranking goals while targeting your most valuable potential buyers.",<urn:uuid:25f22f3d-e50f-4afc-b1bf-90b1a50f6007>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://elearningindustry.com/advertise/elearning-marketing-resources/blog/ways-to-improve-your-seo-strategy-performance-with-user-personas,2024-02-20T23:13:18Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.933682382106781,2374,1.9334664344787598,2

New Administrative Capital, Monday, August 1st, 2023: Mr. Waleid Gamal El-Dien, the Chairman of the General Authority for the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), has witnessed the signing ceremony for an allocation contract between Elsewedy Industrial Development (SD), a subsidiary of ELSEWEDY ELECTRIC (EE), and Mienta the French brand. The contract pertains to the establishment of Mienta’s third factory and warehouse, which will cover a total area of 20,000 square meters in the “Industria Sokhna” project.
Eng. Mohamed AlKammah, CEO, Elsewedy Industrial Development (SD), together with, Nicolas Bouris, Managing Director, Mienta, have signed the agreement, in the presence of Mr. Mohamed Hussein, General Manager, Mienta. Endeavoring to become an export hub in the MENA region, Mienta will invest up to USD 5 million to establish its third factory for small electric home appliances and a warehouse in 2024.
Waleid Gamal El-Dien, Chairman of the General Authority for the Suez Canal Economic Zone, expressed his delight with the unceasing efforts of Elsewedy Industrial Development (SD) to attract foreign investments within SCZONE. This highlights the trust that foreign investors have in Egypt’s favorable investment environment.
Eng. Mohamed AlKammah – CEO, Elsewedy Industrial Development (SD), stated: “It’s our pleasure to form a partnership with one of the leading companies that have consistently shown success in the Egyptian market. As part of our ongoing dedication to supporting manufacturers, we have been working diligently to develop and operate sustainable and integrated industrial cities across a total of nine industrial cities in Egypt and Africa.”
Underscoring SD’s commitment to supporting the state’s plan to develop and promote SCOZNE, AlKammah elaborated: “Elsewedy Industrial Development is developing its mega project in the region, known as ‘SOKHNA360’. This expansive integrated industrial city covers a notable area of 10 million square meters and provides a comprehensive range of smart services and essential facilities. The project is strategically divided into an industrial zone, a logistics zone, a residential zone, social activities, a university, and a technical academy. This remarkable project offers investors the opportunity to capitalize on the commercial advantages of its prime location, which serves as a major gateway for global trade. As a result, it attracts both local and foreign investments, bolstered by the various investment incentives provided by the area.”
Nicolas Bouris, Managing Director of Mienta, commented: “We are thrilled to announce our latest venture in the ‘Industria Sokhna’ in SCZONE, as we embark on the establishment of our third factory in Egypt, building upon the achievements of our previous successful projects. This initiative aligns perfectly with our objective to position ourselves as a key player in the thriving maritime center of the entire region. Coinciding with the French brand’s tenth anniversary celebration in Egypt this year, this project marks a significant milestone in our journey towards further growth and expansion.”
He added: “The factory is projected to achieve its maximum capacity of 650,000 appliances by 2025. Additionally, the site encompasses a warehouse equipped with storage capabilities for more than 200 containers. The presence of ‘Industria Sokhna’ serves as a remarkable opportunity for foreign investors, such as Mienta, as it provides us with a distinct advantage in terms of expedited delivery dates for our neighboring markets.”
It is worth mentioning that the establishment of Mienta’s new factory will significantly expand its product range to include 60 diverse items, encompassing kitchen and cooking utensils, as well as household appliances. Previously, local production was limited to only 35 products, while the rest had to be imported. Moreover, the inauguration of the new factory will create 250 employment opportunities for Egyptian youth.",<urn:uuid:4af78f45-9460-4cb6-abf7-e1ec07e44068>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://elsewedydevelopment.com/with-investments-of-usd-5-million-and-250-job-opportunities-in-sokhna/,2024-02-20T21:33:45Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9360184669494629,970,0.8236819505691528,1
"An essential part of growing your business includes continuously coming up with ways to ensure a steady influx of new contacts to your email list. Given that your email list degrades by an average of 22.5% every year, this is no cakewalk. The degradation happens for a variety of reasons- your customers opt-out of your communications, they change companies, abandon the address using which they signed up for your communications, and the like. The point of saying this is, more often than not, the decay of your email list is out of your control. But, adding new contacts and making sure that your list is growing continuously- now, that’s something that’s entirely within your powers.
For the uninitiated, chalking out an effective email acquisition strategy can be quite overwhelming. To help you gain familiarity thus, we’ve compiled this article that will walk you through a host of inventive and reliable email acquisition tactics. Before we dive into that, however, let us first understand why building an email list is so vital in the first place.
Importance of Building an Email List
When it comes to acquiring new customers, email is 40 times more effective than Facebook or Twitter. Hence, it can be rightfully said that a growing email list translates directly to the growth of your business. The following reasons shed light on the importance of building an email list.
Increases Your Reach
In 2020, the total number of global email users stood at a staggering 4 billion. By 2025, this figure is expected to swell further up to 4.6 billion. Even though roughly 1 in every 6 emails ends up in spam, the resultant reach is still head and shoulders above what other marketing platforms would be able to provide you. You’ll be hard-pressed to find any other channel that has such an extensive user base. Therefore, the more effort you put into building your email list, the more visibility and reach your business will obtain.
Gives You Absolute Control
While social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are great platforms for building an audience, at the end of the day, the data regarding these contacts remain with the platforms themselves. On the other hand, when you’re amassing contacts on an email list, you have all the important data points at your disposal, such as name, contact number, and email address. Subsequently, this allows you to exercise absolute control over the direction you want your email marketing campaigns to take. Moreover, third-party platforms often levy certain restrictions that greatly dictate how you interact with your customers. This is not the case with email.
Lets You Send Personalized Messages
Email marketing does not just let you reach a large number of prospects, it also enables you to send personalized messages their way. It doesn’t matter how many contacts are on your list, email allows you to personalize your communications at scale. This is made possible by email list segmentation which lets you divide your customers into separate segments based on various parameters such as gender, location, ethnicity, age, occupation, buying history, and position on the sales funnel.
Take a look at this personalized product recommendation email from Honey. We don’t know about you, but we find ignoring emails like these very difficult!
Drives Traffic To Other Channels
Many businesses out there start building their email lists even before they start developing their products. And the reason for that is pretty simple- email campaigns are largely responsible for driving traffic to a business’ website as well as all other relevant channels. Needless to say, an extensive list correlates to greater traffic and engagement for your products and services.
Email Acquisition Best Practices You Need To Implement Now
Acquiring the email addresses of prospective clients is a rather tricky affair. You need to be creative and smart with your approach and put in a lot of hard yards to ensure that your plans are executed to perfection.
Make Your Email Content Unique and Compelling
Now, this might be the oldest trick in the book, but it continues to be as evergreen as ever. When your email’s content is engaging, informative, and insightful, it encourages your existing subscribers to forward your emails to their contacts. As a result, this helps you rope in scores of new subscribers, all without spending any additional penny (well, you do spend your creativity, but can’t really put a price on that now, can we?)
Avocode’s engaging newsletter is a brilliant example of how one can leverage content to captivate the imagination of their subscribers.
Use a Single Opt-in
The single opt-in subscription process is the email acquisition technique of choice among many marketers because of its low failure rates. The underlying reason behind that is pretty simple. The less friction in the subscription process, the less will be the number of disgruntled subscribers. Besides enhancing the customer experience, using a single opt-in also paves the path for a faster list growth. Typically, it also facilitates higher conversions since all the customers are required to do over here to sign up for your communications is provide their email addresses. There are no additional steps.
Use a Double Opt-in
Going a step ahead of single opt-in, in a double opt-in subscription process, the subscriber has to confirm their consent twice before they get added to your contact list. After they provide their email address, an email is sent their way asking them to confirm their subscription. Now, double opt-in might experience higher failure rates than single opt-in but at the same time, it also ensures that the quality of your list is top-notch. Everyone who has been added to your list on the back of a double opt-in process is certainly looking forward to interacting and engaging with your content.
Avoid Buying Lists Like The Plague
In a bid to quickly grow their email list, marketers sometimes fall prey to the temptation of purchasing one. Now, this is something that you should avoid at all costs. Buying an email list is problematic on multiple levels:
- It violates the rules of consent stipulated under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a privacy act prevalent throughout Europe that regulates how digital marketers can utilize customer data. Purchasing email lists is non-compliant with GDPR.
- It damages your sender reputation and brand identity.
- The quality of leads of a list that is up for sale is substandard and inauthentic.
- It hampers your email deliverability rates.
Create a Gated Offer
Also known as “lead magnets,” this practice involves providing a resource such as an ebook, cheat sheet, white paper, or checklist in exchange for the customer’s email address. Typically, these resources are hosted on the business’ landing page. Bear in mind that these resources must provide some value to the customer and must be relevant to them. That said, be flexible with your gated offers because there’s no guarantee they will work their charm every single time. At times, you might also need to provide your visitors with some free bonus content or peddle some of your high-performing content pieces as “upgrades” at the time of their sign-up.
Host an Online Contest on Social Media
What’s a better way of grabbing your audience’s eyeballs than organizing a free giveaway on your social media platforms? All they have to do to participate is provide their email address. Some contests even require their participants to tag a couple of their contacts in the comment section to be eligible. Social media handles can be leveraged in various other ways as well. For example, you could take the hero image or the landing page of your email newsletter and make it the display picture on your social media platforms. This instigates the curiosity of your social media audience and incentivizes them to submit their email address to sign up for your newsletter.
Collect Feedback From Your Visitors
Asking your visitors to provide feedback on items pertaining to their interests is a great way to acquire their email addresses. You could do so by either using a simple form or a live chat tool wherein visitors can enter their name and contact information along with their feedback. Alternatively, you can employ these mechanisms to collect their queries as well and subsequently follow up with them on their provided email addresses.
How Can You Maintain Your Email List?
Along with acquiring new addresses, it is equally important that you work dedicatedly towards preventing the decay of your existing list as well. Here are a couple of practices in that direction.
Create Multiple Buyer Personas
Customers these days no longer respond to generic marketing and promotional emails. To grab their attention, you need to intercept them with targeted and personalized messaging. An excellent way of going about this is by segmenting the contacts on your email list into different buyer personas on the basis of their interests and preferences. Engaging different segments of your audience with different, customized messages minimizes the likelihood of them unsubscribing from your email list. As a matter of fact, marketers using segmented campaigns reported having registered a 760% increase in their revenue.
This email from Spotify is a good example of a targeted email. Sending you a song recommendation based on the artists and genres you frequently listen to is assured to reduce the likelihood of subscribers opting out of your communications.
Don’t Give Up on Your Old List
If there’s a certain segment of your customers who haven’t responded to your communications in a while, don’t give up on them just yet. Use whatever data you have regarding their profile to craft and send compelling re-engagement emails their way. If you feel that they’ve outgrown the nature of communications they had signed up for initially, reach out to them again and give them the choice of subscribing to a more curated and targeted list. Remember, acquiring a new customer can cost you five times than retaining an existing one. So, do make sure that you try out every single trick in your book to re-engage your old, disengaged customers before you consider removing them altogether from your list.
Wondering how you should go about your re-engagement emails? Draw some inspirations from this example by Animoto.
Use Preference Centers
Preference centers allow your subscribers to explicitly specify their areas of interest, thereby enabling you to send targeted messages their way. Take a look at this email from Penguin Random House.
It asks the subscribers to specify their genres of interest so that Penguin can send them book recommendations accordingly. Not many will unsubscribe from a newsletter that provides them with curated recommendations, will they?
As you might have already realized, to increase your business’ email list, you need to implement multiple strategies before settling in on a select few that you think work best for your business. And while this entire process can be a touch taxing, the rich dividends that it yields, in the long run, make all the hard yards absolutely worth it.",<urn:uuid:78b7b0fe-c335-425c-ab50-6fb521583541>,CC-MAIN-2024-10,https://email.uplers.com/blog/email-acquisition-best-practices/?noamp=mobile,2024-02-20T23:10:31Z,s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947473347.0/warc/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00000.warc.gz,en,0.9507678747177124,2248,1.140783667564392,1

"LP Wartorn – Destroy All Monsters
SOLID BLACK VINYL, LIMITED TO 200 COPIES.
32 song discography including all the studio recordings (1991-1993) of this high speed thrashing Hardcore brigade from the U.K. Take the best elements and impact of the craziest Japanese, American and British fast-core, blend them all together with some breakneck tempo changes and you get an approximate picture of the aggression they were able to deliver. This is so fast and unpredictable that at times it even oozes of an early pioneering attempt of what some US bands of the time were already labelling as Power Violence, e.g. think of Infest, Neanderthal, Crossed Out or No Comment… Here’s a short biography to introduce them more specifically:
„Formed in late 1990 by SORE THROAT vocalist Rich ?Militia? Walker after the spontaneous combustion of both bands he was playing in (SORE THROAT and WARFEAR), WARTORN began with only one aim, to create a mix of Japanese style HC such as GUDON, SYSTEMATIC DEATH and GAUZE and the ultra-fast attack of America?s SIEGE and YOUTH KORPX. Joining him in this new band were long time comrade Ian The Merciless of local 80?s Death Metal legends QUOTHROS on vocals and Dutch lunatic drummer Lennaert Roomer. Early rehearsals also included DISASTER?s guitar player Browny on bass. And with this embryonic line up the band recorded the raw and primitive ?Last among Equals? demo tape on a battered 4 track recorder in early 1991. Pretty soon after Browny moved on to concentrate on DISASTER full time, so the ex-bassist of WARFEAR was brought in and an additional vocalist called Mel. With this line up the band began playing live aiming to make peoples ears bleed in the local scene with their unrelenting high velocity assaults, much to the dismay of the fashion following local peers as WARTORN?s music stood out like a sore thumb in a sea of pretentious Black Flag acolytes. In 1992 the band recorded tracks for the ?Trapped In A tooth gear? Sampler LP and a split EP with Rich & Lennaerts other band NAILBOMB (The original, not the band who stole their name after playing a show with them). As with all bands, the inevitable musical differences cropped up, the bassist was becoming increasingly bewildered by the fast progressing style which just kept on getting faster, and Mel the vocalist just disappeared after one gig never to be seen again. Parting ways with the bass player in late 1992 WARTORN replaced him with Big Jim Rushby (Of IRONSIDE/IRON MONKEY) and began teaching him the tracks for a new EP. Eventually in early 1993 WARTORN entered Fulton St Studios and in three hours laid down 11 brand new songs and a cover of Madball?s ?Get Out?. Further gigging with the likes of Voorhees and Chaos UK followed before the band played their final show in the summer of 1994 before Lennaert and Jim both moved to different parts of the country thus rendering the band inactive only a few months before the second EP ?Banzai? was released on the guitar player of DROPDEAD?s label over a year after it was recorded?“
