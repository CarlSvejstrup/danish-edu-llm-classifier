"This project is solving the Asteroid Watchers challenge. Description
AROs are essentially created by combining a telescope with a smartphone. If the telescope has drive motors can be controlled via a standard protocol, it is controlled by the SkyWatch app on the smartphone. Telescopes with no drive motors of their own need to have these and a controlling Arduino added. We plan to create or adopt a small reference / demo model of this an a open source hardware and software sub-project, where the smartphone controls the Arduino to operate this telescope's stepper motors.
All AROs, their location and capabilities are registered in the Global ARO Co-Ordinator (GAROC) database.
Basic Variant: This version allows the ARO owner to build the hardware and get it up and running and connected into the SkyWatch network. The focus here is to get various simple, low-power home-built and commonly sourced telescopes into the network, for maximum global participation. The system caters for telescopes that are driven with standard controller protocols, and also simple telescopes that have stepper motors driving it via an Arduino. We will create or adopt a reference model of this latter type.
The basic ARO receives messages in via an app running on a smartphone which controls the telescope. this is a one-way communications system: the ARO does not communication back out. This allows for manual (ie eyeball) observation only. The ARO owner is separately messaged via email and SMS that their ARO is activated. The ARO emits a warning sound and flashes for the time that it is tracking, as directed by the GAROC.
Once owners have got these basic AROs up and running, many might decide to extend their capability.
Extended Capability Variants: An ARO can be upgraded to more advanced variants. All these variants are capable of two way communication between them and the GAROC (the Global ARO Controller). As each extra sensor is added to an ARO and its Arduino is reprogrammed to control its additional capability, the relevant configuration information is sent out to the GAROC. The ARO modules give the ARO the extended capabilities, such as to return image data, to operate in a very remote location, and to send back its own position, a zone map to show its zone of capture, and its current visibility in real-time. This results in smarter AROs, and images of the sky can be transmitted from them. The modules providing the additional capabilities are ...
Camera module: Takes snapshots or motion video and transmits these back to an image server.
SkyZone module: ARO reports its viewable zone, ie reducing what it can see due to hills, trees, buildings etc
ImageQuality module: ARO reports realtime visibility. An image map/snapshot is taken by a camera mounted to look through the telescope. The pixels of the image are read, in a similar way to how our TechSpace webcams work out the brightness of our camera images. This module will need the addition of a more powerful processing node, eg a PC, Raspberry Pi, or BeagleBone etc to perform the processing.
Remote ARO: Communicates via SMS, wifi, RF etc, and is especially suited for power via solar/batteries. This allows the ARO to be located remotely, eg out in the country, for city-dwelling owners of AROs.
Local grid module: subnetwork of AROC, each controlling a grid of AROs. These AROCs will provide staged storage of volumes of image data. The nodes could be the same PC, Raspberry Pi, or BeagleBone (the likely preferred open-source option) as above, as per the owner's preference, but all running Linux.
All hardware and software components of this system will be open source.

"What Is Florida State Law on Travel Time?
If you’re wondering about the details of Florida state law on travel time, you’re not alone. Many employees have questions about whether travel time should be compensated, especially when it comes to work-related activities. Florida’s laws, closely aligned with federal guidelines, ensure fair treatment for employees and provide clear instructions for employers regarding compensable travel time.
This article will explore how travel time is handled under Florida law, when it’s compensable, and what employees need to know to avoid potential disputes.
Understanding Travel Time and Compensation Under Florida Law
In Florida, not all travel time is considered compensable. The state follows the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) guidelines, which outline the circumstances under which employees must be paid for their travel time.
Commuting vs. Work-Related Travel
A crucial distinction in Florida law is between regular commuting and work-related travel. Generally, commuting—traveling from your home to your primary work location—is not considered work time and does not require compensation. However, if travel is an essential part of your job, such as traveling between job sites or attending meetings, it is considered work-related travel and must be compensated.
Overtime and Travel Time
Florida follows federal overtime laws, which require employees to be compensated at a rate of one and a half times their regular pay for any hours worked over 40 in a week. Travel time that is considered work time under Florida law counts toward the total hours worked for the week. If these hours exceed 40, employees may be eligible for overtime pay.
When it comes to overnight travel, Florida law follows FLSA rules, which state that travel during normal work hours must be compensated, even if the travel happens on a day the employee doesn’t usually work, such as a weekend.
For example, if you are required to travel on a Saturday between 10 AM and 2 PM for a work conference, those four hours are considered compensable, even though they fall outside your regular work schedule.
Employee Rights and Compensation for Travel Time
Employees should be aware of their rights regarding travel time compensation under Florida law. If your employer requires you to travel for work purposes, whether it’s attending a seminar, traveling between job sites, or visiting clients, that time must be compensated.
If an employer does not pay for work-related travel, it could be a violation of wage laws, and employees may take legal action to recover unpaid wages.
Training and Work Conferences
If your employer requires you to attend training sessions, workshops, or conferences, the time spent traveling to and from these events is also considered work time and must be compensated.
Common Exceptions to Travel Time Compensation
While Florida law generally follows federal rules for compensable travel time, there are some exceptions where travel time may not require payment:
- Commuting: Travel from home to your regular work location is not compensable.
- Personal Errands During a Business Trip: If you take personal time during a business trip (e.g., sightseeing), this time is not compensable.
- Travel Outside Normal Working Hours: If travel occurs outside regular work hours and you are not actively engaged in work, it may not need to be compensated.
Employer Obligations and Record-Keeping
Employers in Florida are required to follow both state and federal regulations concerning travel time. They must clearly define which travel activities are compensable and maintain accurate records of work-related travel time.
Employees who believe they are not being compensated for work-related travel should address the issue with their employer or seek legal advice if necessary.
Legal Recourse for Unpaid Travel Time
If you believe your employer is not paying you appropriately for compensable travel time, you can file a wage claim under the FLSA. In some cases, employees may be entitled to back pay, penalties, and damages for unpaid travel time.
FAQs on Florida Travel Time Law
Is commuting time compensable in Florida?
No, commuting from your home to your regular work location is not considered compensable under Florida law.
When should an employee be compensated for travel time?
Employees should be compensated for any travel directly related to their job duties, such as traveling between work sites or attending meetings and conferences.
Does travel time count toward overtime?
Yes, if the travel time is compensable, it counts toward the total hours worked. If those hours exceed 40 in a week, overtime laws apply.
Is overnight travel compensable?
Yes, employees must be compensated for travel during regular working hours, even if it occurs on weekends or outside their regular workdays.
Can I file a complaint if my employer doesn’t pay for travel time?
Yes, employees can file a wage claim under the FLSA if they believe they have not been properly compensated for travel time.
In summary, Florida state law on travel time requires employers to compensate employees for work-related travel, but not for regular commuting. Understanding the difference between commuting and work-related travel is crucial for both employers and employees to avoid disputes. If you believe you’re not being compensated for travel time as required, consulting with a labor attorney may be your best course of action.",0.9476781487464905,1083,1.7915176153182983
"It’s a fact: mushrooms are notoriously tricky to identify. It’s possible to have two mushrooms that look similar to the eye, but are fundamentally different at a genetic level. So, for as long as humans have been benefiting from mushrooms as food and medicine, we’ve relied on experts to verify their correct identity. Mycologists (mushroom scientists) have been steadily building our body of knowledge on how to distinguish each unique type of mushroom. One of the best ways turns out to be DNA testing.
New Chapter’s LifeShield™ products give you mushroom strains that are identity assured. Every strain - from Reishi to Maitake to Turkey Tail - is carefully qualified and confirmed. This includes identification through mushroom DNA testing. We established a new gold standard in mushroom identification: taking the time to test each strain at the DNA level, then crosscheck and confirm the results with robust databases. Every batch is also tested against an established chemical fingerprint for that mushroom

"Life of a Sand Grain
THE LIFE OF A SAND GRAIN by Carl Bowser (Sept. 2018)
They surround you almost anywhere you are in Arizona. They cling to your shoes, they end up in pockets and pant cuffs, they provide a little crunch to that clam chowder you made, they color the water of streams tumbling through mountain canyons, and they wash back and forth in the waves on the shore of an ocean or lake. They are found most anywhere, and are very common. Yes, it’s the common sand grain. Scientifically defined as mineral grains that range in size from 4.8 mm (very coarse) to 0.4mm (very fine grained), sand grains not only vary greatly in size and shape, but they also vary greatly in their mineral composition. But the queen of sand grains is made up of common quartz (SiO2). If each, single grain of sand could talk, oh what a story it could tell!
Over the years, geologists have learned to read some quartz grain’s stories, but they are really stories of aggregates of grains, not individuals. Some general rules guide the shape, size, and variety of quartz grains (and other less common ones that we will talk about later). Typically, coarser sands are more angular in shape and tend to have more different neighbors (different minerals such as feldspar or iron/magnesium minerals like amphibole). As the sand makes it way to the sea, be it from a glacier, a sand storm, or more likely by river, it gets more rounded by abrasion against other grains and in the process, gets smaller and smaller. The wind and rivers are excellent sorting media and as each grain works its way to the sea, they not only become smaller and more rounded, but grains of similar size tend to sort together. Just like the grains of sand settling in a glass of water, the coarser (and heavier) grains sink faster than the smaller, lighter ones. (Try it yourself, using some sandy soil from your yard).
Thus, heterogeneity becomes a measure of the age of accumulated sand grains. Young accumulations of sand are coarser, more angular, and less well sorted, and as the grains “age” they get smaller, more rounded, and much better sorted. We describe the age of sand accumulations by their maturity, that is, how long the grains have been subject to the processes of grain erosion, transport distance, and current (or wind) sorting. The next time you are near a river pick up a handful of sand and examine it carefully. If you have one, use a hand lens or jeweler’s loupe to look closer at the grains and notice their size, rounding, and how many different kinds there are. Put some in a small plastic bag to save for later. The next time you are at the beach, get a sample from the shoreline, and another sample from the wind-blown dunes that lie higher and inland from the beach. Compare all three samples and pay special attention to the differences within and among the samples. Heck, why stop there? Do as I have, and book travel around the world to collect sand samples from the sand dunes of Namibia, Egypt, Australia, and the western U.S. and all the exotic, vacation worthy beaches of the world. I guarantee that no two samples will be the same, be they river, beach, or dune sands.
So where do these quartz grains come from? The answer comes from the very beginning of our planet’s history well over four billion years ago. Water on the early planet gathered at its surface to form its first oceans. These oceans presumably covered a large portion of the planet. Deeper, below the planet’s solidified crust lies molten material that would later solidify to become rocks as they cooled nearer the earth’s surface. These early rocks crystallized to form rocks low in silica content and higher in iron, magnesium, and aluminum, but gradually, through continued melting, re-solidifying and remelting, quartz would begin to appear in some of these rocks as products of igneous differentiation. As they evolved to form more silica rich, lower-density rocks, these, quartz-bearing rocks, then formed higher standing (floating) masses that then, ultimately emerged above the ocean’s surface to form dry land (islands, and later, continents). From these less dense highlands the first grains of quartz appeared, but still locked within the rocks. Upon exposure to crashing waves, rain, and ever present tectonic movements these rocks were broken down into their constituent minerals, and, thus, the first, sedimentary quartz grains were born. Along with their birth, the quartz fragments were joined by other rock grains composed of dark minerals (principally pyroxenes and amphibole), K-feldspar, and plagioclase were also freed, and these, main “characters” began the long and storied histories in their race to the sea to form the first (perhaps of many) sand accumulations (sedimentary rocks).
But these other minerals have a disadvantage compared to quartz, and it would have consequences. Amphiboles, plagioclase and K-feldspar grains are much more chemically active and suffer from a property that quartz doesn’t, they have easy parting zones (cleavage). Thus, as they travel the path to the sea they are not only rounded and diminished in size like quartz, but they break into smaller sized particles when they split and cleave. Poor amphibole degrades so rapidly that it’s of little consequence to all but the most immature of sand deposits. Of the two feldspars, plagioclase is the most vulnerable, and quickly diminishes in size and abundance or is weathered into other minerals. Consequently, the quartz to plagioclase ratio of sediments increase as the sands mature (age). Eventually, the K-feldspar succumbs to these processes as well, so the more evolved sediment is characterized by higher quartz to plagioclase AND K-feldspar ratios. In the world of sedimentary rocks, you might consider quartz to be the teflon of the minerals, at least relative to its other mineral companions. Today we find these mature sands (sand dunes and beach sands) mostly as quartz rich, well rounded, and better sorted. Of course, there are exceptions, but that is another story I’ll have to save for a later time.
On our dynamic earth these unconsolidated sands ultimately become hardened with burial and increased temperature and turn into sandstones, or even their metamorphic equivalent, quartzite, and so began the long, slow process of burial, uplift and re-exposure to the elements of weathering and erosion as these rocks follow the rock cycle and, again, appear at the earth’s surface. Sadly, the quartz grain, comfortably embedded with its neighboring sand grains in what it thought was its final resting place, again finds itself freed, and involved in the process of moving, again, down a stream or carried by the wind. Thus, is born a multi-cycled grain, rounded and sorted, and with even fewer other contaminant minerals, a nearly pure quartz sand. From here the story gets muddled as it is currently impossible to count the number of times a given quartz grain has made this trip. My former colleague, Bob Dott, (memorialized in last month’s blog) once addressed the problem, but, at the time, the available tools were crude, and definitive conclusions were hard to make. On rare occasions, a quartz grain remained welded to it former companion from an earlier cycle, and we might be able to conclude that it is a two-cycle grain, but recognizing cycles beyond two remains a challenge. Single, or wedded, these grains don’t reveal their histories easily, but if only they could, what stories each could tell!
Fortunately, there may be tools on the horizon to help answer the question of grain “cyclicity”. Another of these Teflon-like (resistant) minerals, zircon (ZrO2), is also highly resistant to weathering, perhaps even more than quartz, but much lower in abundance. It’s presence in sediments is important, but it requires more exacting techniques to separate them for analysis. Internally these zircons show rings, onion-skin like, and reveal the growth history of each grain. Even better these grains carry trace amounts of uranium and lead isotopes that enable us to determine its geologic age. By implication each zircon reveals its source age and history, and, thus, the ages of the rocks eroding to form these sedimentary rocks, river sands, etc. Sediments typically contains many zircon grains of different ages, and a plot of their abundance looks like a histogram with many peaks, each with different heights (abundance) and age. Careful geologic mapping, zircon dating and rock examination can tell us more about the life of these sand grains. Pioneering work on the ages of zircons in sediments is being done here at the University of Arizona Geosciences, in the lab of Dr. George Gehrels and his colleagues.
In the meantime, individual quartz grains continue their trips to the sea and back, taking their own, sweet time, some faster, some slower, and sadly, each grain is unable to remember its specific paths to the sea (and back). These nearly indestructible grains grow older and older, keeping their secrets until the next advance in science helps crack their narrative. “All right, you guys! Which one of you is the oldest? Which of you has made this trip before?. [Silence].
Hopefully you remembered about the sand grains I asked you to collect earlier. If you did, take them out and look at them again, this time even more carefully. They may have a much more interesting story to tell than you ever imagined. Earth’s clocks, but without hands.
Figure 1: Colorado River sand near Lees Ferry. Note the mix of different angularities, including some very well rounded grains (probably from eroded sandstones that have a wind-blown source, and likely from nearby sands like the Navajo sandstone.
Figure 2. Nanny Goat Beach, Sapelo Island, Georgia. Very fine grained, nearly pure quartz sands transported along the beaches from Connecticut to Georgia. Despite their long transport distance the grains are still highly angular, but also free of feldspars. Mineralogically more mature, but texturally still very immature.
Figure 3. St. Peter sandstone (Ordovician age), Dane County, Wisconsin. A very well sorted sand both texturally and mineralogically. My best candidate for a “polycyclic” sandstone.
Figure 4. Wisconsin River near its confluence with the Mississippi River. A heterogeneous mix of mature and immature sands both mineralogically and texturally. The very well rounded grains are unmistakably derived from the Ordovician, St. Peter sandstone, along with a mix of less mature grains derived from Pleistocene glacial material, derived miles upstream.",0.9597853422164917,2344,3.534467935562134

"There have been some stronger arguments for ‘no’ in the last day. The Herald posted a formidable editorial to say that
“The Herald backs Scotland staying within the UK at this stage. But fudge this process, stitch it up and fail to deliver far-reading further devolution, and make no mistake – you wil be guaranteeing another referendum – one that you will lose, and deserve to lose.”
They complain – fairly – that
“in promoting its manifesto for Scottish independence, a Panglossian emphasis on the best-case scenario has at times strained its credibility. … the case for independence has been built upon a string of ideal outcomes. Even the other party in this great divorce, the Government at Westminster, would, it is assumed, act at all times during separation in accordance with the Scottish Government’s wishes.”
David Webster also asked me particularly to mention a negative argument by Carol Craig in the Scottish Review. Her best point is that:
“If Scotland gains independence then for decades most of its political and intellectual resources will be channelled into becoming another, largely inadequate, European state.”
I don’t agree about the inadequacy. I do agree that it will take time, and resources.
There has also been, however, a chorus of negative, scaremongering comments. Supermarket prices will go up; Scotland can’t afford the NHS (stuff and nonsense); it will not be able to run a finance industry without a lender of last resort (doesn’t anyone remember the building societies, built on mutualism and secured loans?) This has been the weakness of the No campaign all the way through, made worse in the last week by carpet-baggers from London who imagine that Scottish voters haven’t thought about anything in a two year campaign.
With a day to go, I’m still undecided. The ‘yes’ campaign wins out on principles and on process. I’ve loved the energy, intelligence and civic sense of the ‘yes’ campaign – a far cry from the way it’s painted by people who’ve not been around to hear the arguments. The ‘no’ campaign wins on practicality, but not on much else.",0.9516766667366028,472,1.1717629432678223

"I have been participating in the Mask-erade Classes this week. I have really enjoyed learning so many new techniques and encourage you to try some of these things to. My card today is for my Day 3 homework, but also for the Friday Mashup Challenge and the Addicted to Stamps Challenge. The sketch was perfect for my card and I had to use watercoloring in my homework. The anything goes challenge at Addicted to Stamps made it a win-win. Today's card is used by masking my flowers with rubber cement. I hope you enjoy my card!
This week's Mashup! Challenge is:
- Create a project with ""Watercoloring"".
- Create a project using ""the Sketch"".
- or Mash it Up! and create a ""Watercolored Project using the Sketch"".
My card features one of my all time favorite flower stamps, Regarding Dahlias by Stampin' Up! (Retiring June 2nd!) It always inks so nicely, gives a beautiful result and lasting impression! I stamped the first flower in the corner. I then stamped the flower on masking paper, cut it out and used it to mask the first stamped flower. I stamped two more flowers after applying the mask. I painted rubber cement over the dahlias and let them dry for several hours. I came back and decided to us my Tim Holtz distress inks for the watercoloring. I used three different shades of ink. Peacock Feathers, Peeled Paint and Broken China. I added a little water to the inks and let it all run together.
I am very happy with the way my card turned out. It is my first attempt at this new skill and plan to keep practicing! I used my fingers to rub off all the rubber cement. It was like being in Elementary School again! I still love the smell of rubber cement! I mounted the finished panel on black card stock and mounted it on white.
Thanks for stopping by today! Please leave a comment if you have time! It means so much to me to hear from you!

"Why do you think you get along so well, and are so attracted to, Leos?
Oh dear, no. When I point out that I have a thing for Leos, it’s an observation based on evidence, not a preference based on superstition.
It just happens to be the case that a large cluster of my inner-circle was born in mid-August. They’re Leos. I have no problem calling them that for poetic effect, but beyond the silly harmlessness of a little mythical characterization, I draw the line at taking any of that zodiac nonsense seriously.
Astrology is total bullshit. You guys all know that, right?
There is no causal link between our individual personalities and the relative position of celestial bodies, nor are there any rational conclusions to be drawn about interpersonal compatibility based on astrological birth signs.
If you read your horoscope for a laugh, fine, but if you consult a star chart before making life decisions, then you’re straight up fucking retarded.

"An archive photo of an Egyptian mummy - Reuters
By Tom Perry
CAIRO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Archaeologists in Egypt believe they have discovered the remains of a previously unknown pharaoh who reigned more than 3,600 years ago.
The skeleton of King Senebkay were uncovered at South Abydos in Sohag province, about 500 km (300 miles) south of Cairo, by a University of Pennsylvania expedition working with the government, the Egyptian antiquities ministry said.
Never before heard of in ancient Egyptian history, King Senebkay's name was found inscribed in hieroglyphics written inside a royal cartouche - an oval with a horizontal line at one end signalling a royal name, the ministry said in a statement.
Photographs released with the statement showed what appeared to be a heavily damaged sarcophagus in a burial chamber with no roof. Its stone walls were decorated with painted images.
The photos also showed the pharaoh's skeleton laid out on a white sheet. ""He was originally mummified but his body was pulled apart by ancient tomb robbers,"" said the caption.
""No funerary furniture was found in the tomb, confirming it had been robbed in the ancient pharaonic ages,"" the statement said, quoting Ali al-Asfar, an antiquities ministry official.
In the statement written in Arabic, Joseph Wegner, head of the expedition, added: ""The modesty of the size of the tomb points to the decline of economic conditions in this period"".
The statement dates King Senebkay's rule to 1650 BC during a time known as the second intermediate period when central authority collapsed and small kingdoms sprung up between the end of the Middle Kingdom and the start of the New Kingdom.

"The faith of the Christ-God is a living paradox in the Asiatic world. Christianity has long survived in Asia’s periphery, especially in the Near East and to a lesser extent in India, but it has never thrived in Asia’s heart, the Orient.
Generally speaking , the farther east one moves across the Eurasian continent away from Constantinople to Beijing, the more mystical and relative philosophy and theology become. The absolute and ridged dynamics of evil versus good and the rationality of the Abrahamic religions fade away in the face of subjective, Vedic traditions. Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Islam naturally then fit as oil to Vedic water.
When Christianity comes to the Vedic world, it presents a monotheistic, good-evil dichotomy that is completely foreign to the natives of the Orient. Therefore when many Buddhists, Hindus, Taoists, Shintoists, and Confucianists are confronted by Jesus, He does not fit into their historical paradigms.
Regardless of the temporary irrelevance of Christianity in the East, other than as a means of American political elites to con conservatives into supporting a third invasion of Iraq, the coming future of Christianity is to move eastward and take root in Beijing, instead of Rome. Twenty-first-century Christianity will be dominated by the Oriental peoples, with China serving as its political sword, much like France under Charlemagne. With the demographic time bomb inevitably going to burst in Europe at present course, the demographic time bomb of Christianity bursting to take over China is also inevitable—curiously enough, almost at the same time in the mid-late twenty-first century.
Presenting Christianity to the Oriental peoples has always been a very difficult issue, given that the Christian faith has been carried by the standards of European powers. Christianity has always had a long presence in the Orient, especially China, since the mid-600s. But in the late 900s, Emperor Wuzong, in a spirit of what could be considered hyper-Chinese nativism, expelled Buddhist, Christian, and Zoroastrian teachings and initiated a massive persecution of Christians that nearly exterminated Christianity altogether in the East. Under the Mongols, interestingly enough, Christianity returned to China and much of the rest of the Orient though the free-moving economic zone of the Mongol Empire.
Christianity has always had a difficult presence in East Asia, especially China and Japan. In China, the difficulty came in Christ’s Gospel’s clashing with the words of Confucius, whose philosophy was similar to Christianity in that man worships the God of the heavens. The only problem is that for the Chinese, heaven was transcendent to earth, whereas heaven and earth are two separate entities in Christian teaching. Therefore the message of Christ turned into a force of insurrection against the Mandate of Heaven that guided the state, since Christ was the King of all kings. A similar story is true in Japan, where the Shogunates were always suspicious of Christianity because it undermined the supremacy of Shogun rule by divine authority.
In the modern age, now that Maoism has decimated China’s ancient identity and traditions with atheism, Christianity is making a new stunning emergence in the nation that has historically rejected it, as the Gospel of Jesus Christ brings deeper meaning and faith to a people perhaps even more wed to materialistic philosophy than the Americans.
In South Korea, Christianity is exploding and is now the single largest religion in the Republic of Korea. Much of this conversion came after the Second World War, when the United States sacrificed its blood to protect the Republic from the communists of the north. The United States then needed a powerful force on the Korean peninsula loyal to its interests and consequently, after fifty years of economic support coupled with intense missionary activity, South Korea is now Asia’s leading Christian country.
A tragically opposite story exists in Japan. After the war, the Japanese mythology of the god-emperor was over and the Japanese were searching for something new to believe in. Rather than following the advice and model of General MacArthur to convert the Japanese to Christianity, America instead gave them a different god to worship: capitalism. Granted, it helped Japan rapidly modernize so Sony, Toshiba, Honda, and Toyota could own the American economy, but Christianity has been utterly stagnant in a nation that worships the god-dollar rather than the god-emperor or the one true God.
If current conversion rates continue, the center of Christianity in the twenty-second century is going be Beijing and Seoul, rather than Rome or Westminster, with perhaps a sort of interregnum period where Moscow serves as the Third Rome. Japan’s future is uncertain, but if what happened to Rome happens to China and South Korea, a Christian Orient is quite likely. So if the West cannot resolve the Islamic question in the twenty-first century, imagine what an empowered, militarized Christian China could accomplish.
According to Sacred Tradition, Christianity was introduced to India by St. Thomas the Apostle in 52 AD in Kerala; hence they are now known as St. Thomas Christians. India was already partially Christianized before Scandinavia, Russia, and the British Isles ever had significant populations of Christians.
Christ from an Indian perspective must be viewed though the Hindu worldview. According to Hindu thought, every human being possesses some element of the divine inside of him. Some people learn to manifest it more, but some do not, and it is not necessarily the duty of an ecclesiastical body or school of thought to claim a monopoly on the exact means and path to moksha (enlightenment).
Therefore, for Christians to arrive in India and claim that Jesus Christ is the one true God-Man stands in stark contrast to the pantheistic views of Hindu society. This presets a conundrum of how Hindus view Jesus. For when a Christian emerges to declare that Jesus Christ is God, the Hindu is inclined to say, “Well yes, of course.” This is a very similar dilemma that Christians encountered in their interactions with Roman and Nordic pagans, where worshiping the Christ-God was allowed next to the worship of the old gods.
To the Hindus, however, the teachings of Jesus Christ can and do resonate with Indian society. The tempered notions of Jesus as an enlightened teacher automatically give Indians an inclined ear, given the history and prevalence of many different enlightened teachers who have populated India’s historical landscape. Remember, it was India which produced the Buddha and which in turn gave us the Dali Lama. This legacy of producing deep religious figures is a major part of India’s identity.
The presence of Hinduism presents a difficult conundrum for Christian evangelization in India. By presenting Christ as God to the Hindus, the Christian is already affirming the reality of Hinduism. Only by establishing the supremacy of Christ as a chosen prophet can the Hindu come to reject Hinduism and become a Christian. However, despite these challenges and centuries where Christianity has occupied a low position in Indian society, India is becoming one of the fastest-converting Christian nations.
To be an Arab Christian is to be condemned as a persecuted minority, yet such Christians are a gateway to the past. Many mainstream Arabs are Christian, and Christians have historically been in many elite positions of power, most notably in Ba’athist regimes. Yet, amongst the commoners, many still find themselves on the periphery of society, due to their loyalty to ancient historical groups. Most noteworthy of these are the Copts of Egypt, the Assyrians of Iraq and Syria, the Kurds, and the Maronites of Lebanon.
Arabs were some of the first peoples to encounter Jesus, see His miracles, and even watch Him crucified and resurrected from the dead. The growth of Christianity in the Arab world was perhaps one of the most organic growths of the Faith. There were not many great expeditions of evangelism inside the Arab world, as the Faith took off very naturally. The violent arrival of Islam onto the Arab scene has dealt a very damaging blow to the Christian identity of Arabs, but yet, to this day, many Christian Arabs are direct descendants from the first generation of Christians who walked with Christ Himself.
To many of these Arab and even non-Arab groups, often times being a Christian is a way to keep the ancient folkish traditions alive in the face of jihadist Islam, which seeks to undermine folkish traditions and blend all peoples into a universalist identity of the ummah. The sad reality regarding Arab Christianity is that it is on the verge of extermination. In 1948, the Holy Land was 18% Christian, and now it is only 2%. The dual problem of a rising jihadist Islam and hostile Israeli policies forces Arab Christians to either depart or stay and be persecuted. Without a vibrant Christian Europe or United States to stand as a bulwark against a rising Islamism or force the hand of Israel to be more tolerant, Christianity’s future in its home region looks bleak.
Notwithstanding Jesus’s fulfillment of their own prophecy, Christ for the Hebrews has been one of the most difficult encounters in the Christian faith. To an extent it has already been decided, when in Matthew 27:24-25 the Jewish mob declared, “His blood be on us and on our children!” The Jews had then rejected their promised Messiah and therefore condemned themselves to spiritual exile. That being said, this does not render it impossible for Jews to become Christians.
For the Jew that becomes a Christian, he is meeting the fulfillment of the God of his ancestors that was never fully revealed to him. The prophets gave the Jews glimpses, but even the patriarchs and prophets in the Old Testament did not clearly know the Messiah, but rather believed on the promise of the Messiah. So the Hebrew that comes to Christ is receiving the fulfillment of his patrimony.
Sadly, most Hebrews stand in fulfillment of the Jewish mob’s pledge and take great pride in scorning Jesus. To the majority of Jews, Jesus is a renegade, the most dangerous false Messiah to ever curse the Jewish people. By rejecting the divinity of Jesus Christ, the breach with Christianity is complete.
When the Hebrews were exiled and began to live amongst Christians in Christian lands, the Talmud was constructed in order to provide Jews with the ways and means to be Jewish while not being in the Holy Land. This required Jews to develop a coherent doctrine regarding Jesus Christ and the Christians. The Babylonian Talmud provides this, cursing Jesus as a practitioner of witchcraft, reviling Mary as a fornicatress and whore. Though it affirms Jesus’s crucifixion, it asserts that He deserved it as a criminal who is now burning in hell in His own excrement. There is no other religion where Jesus is treated with such hostility. Though Islam does not treat Christians with much dignity, it does regard Jesus Christ as a prophet, and the Koran pays great honor to the Virgin Mother.
Jesus to the Hebrews, then, is either the greatest fulfillment of history or their greatest enemy, because Jesus Christ presently, just as He did in His era, poses the greatest threat to Jewish earthly power. The Jews have turned their history, symbols, heritage, and so forth into such an idol that they cannot and could not recognize Jesus when He came to them. Therefore Christianity becomes the most heinous of all enemies to the Jews, because it is the perversion of their faith and must consequently be treated with the greatest resistance.
Unlike European paganism, in which the paradigms of Christianity made it much easier to present the Christ as a fulfillment of Greek philosophical thought or a stronger chieftain than Odin, the Jesus of the Orient is much more confrontational. To an extent He is yet to resonate with Oriental thought patterns and folkways. He is an outside figure with an outside message, mainly identified with the political power of the white-man. This notwithstanding, in due time we can await a Christianized Orient as the Gospel goes forth.",0.9585059881210327,2450,2.682129383087158

"There are a lot of ways to damage your credit score, from falling for a credit card scam to just being unlucky with the recent economy. This article will give you some tips on how you can improve your situation.
If your credit does not allow you to obtain new credit, getting a secured one is much easier and will help fix your credit. Most likely, you will not have a problem obtaining this type of card, but you must add funds to the account before you make any purchases to assure the bank that you will pay. If you get a new card and use it responsibly, it will help to improve your credit score.
Make sure that you are never using more than 50% of your credit card’s limit. If your credit card balances exceed 50% of their limits, it will lower your credit score, so spread your debt over multiple cards, or better, pay down the balances.
Maintaining a respectable credit score will enable you to obtain lower interest rates. By doing this your monthly payments will be easier to afford and your bill will be paid off faster. Paying your outstanding balances on time is the best way to keep your credit in check, and to obtain lower interest rates.
Getting an installment account can help you earn money and provide a boost to your credit. Make sure that you are able to afford the payments on any installment accounts that you open. You can quickly improve your score by successfully managing these accounts.
Make sure you check out any credit counseling agency you consider using. While many counselors are reputable and exist to offer real help, some do have ulterior motives. Some are not legitimate. You should always find out if a credit counselor is the real thing.
Credit Card Companies
Call and request lower limits on your cards from the credit card companies. This is likely to keep you from overusing credit, which can be a financial burden. It also lets credit card companies know that you are responsible, and this makes them more likely to extend credit to you as time goes on.
If you are doing hardcore credit score repair, you need to scrutinize your report for negative entries. The item may be essentially correct, but there may be an error someplace. If the date or amount, or some other thing is incorrect it may be possible to get the entire item removed.
Sign up with a credit union if you need to get a new credit line and are having a hard time. These credit unions can probably give you better credit options in the long run.
If you wish to repair your credit, you’ll have to stop spending more than you earn. This is nothing short of a lifestyle overhaul. For a while, the easy availability of credit encouraged people to buy more than they could afford. We now must pay for that. You should look at what you can afford to spend, before using credit for purchases.
As part of your credit score repair process, it is a good idea to terminate all of your credit cards except one. Making one monthly payment will be easier than paying off different bills. This can help you avoid paying down smaller balances and focus on paying one card off.
Taking time to examine your monthly credit card bill is critical to ensure that there are no errors. Contact the credit card company right away if there are incorrect fees, so that they won’t be on your credit report.
Try not to file bankruptcy if at all possible. Bankruptcies appear on credit reports for ten years. It might seem like a good thing but you will be affected down the line. Most lenders will be hesitant to work with you in the future when a bankruptcy shows on your credit report.
Timely payments will keep your credit status in good standing. Late payments are added to credit reports and they can damage your chances of getting loans or a home in the future.
Getting your credit in line is probably an area of stress for you. Guidance you get from this article can turn that stress into pleasure. The advice offered in this article can help to get you back on track to repairing your credit.",0.9587657451629639,826,1.887213945388794

"Two-way capacity between Europe and North America is scheduled to hit about 2.56 million weekly seats by the end of June, marking the highest number of available seats since September 2019.
A total of 423 airport pairs will receive nonstop flights during the month. Among them will be new transatlantic routes being launched by Air Canada, British Airways (BA), JetBlue Airways and Norse Atlantic Airways.
Air Canada is opening two routes from Montreal, connecting the city with Amsterdam (AMS) and Toulouse (TLS). The service to AMS will operate seasonally five times per week using Boeing 787-8 aircraft, while flights to TLS will also be 5X-weekly aboard Airbus A330-300s.
The latter route will operate year-round, connecting two global aerospace centres. The flights will provide competition for Air Transat’s 4X-weekly operations using A321neos and A330-200s.
Starting June 5, BA will begin flying to Cincinnati Northern Kentucky from London Heathrow (LHR). Service will be five times per week in the summer and four in the winter using 787-8s.
According to data provided by Sabre Market Intelligence, O&D traffic between Cincinnati and London totaled 33,696 two-way passengers in 2019—all of whom traveled indirect. The figure made London the city’s largest O&D market in Europe—ahead of Paris, with 24,614 two-way passengers.
Norse Atlantic Airways is also expanding its transatlantic offering from London with two new routes out of London Gatwick. After commencing flights to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale in May, service will begin this month to Washington Dulles (IAD) and Los Angeles (LAX), and operations to San Francisco (SFO) start in July. Norse plans to serve IAD six times per week and fly daily to LAX.
Elsewhere, JetBlue is also expanding its transatlantic presence with the launch of its long-awaited route to Paris, becoming its second city in Europe. Frequencies between New York John F. Kennedy (JFK) and Paris Charles de Gaulle will be daily from June 29 using A321LRs.
According to OAG Schedules Analyser figures, New York-Paris is the third-largest U.S.-Europe airport pair by weekly capacity, with 43,578 two-way seats. JFK-LHR is the largest with 76,722 seats, followed by LAX-LHR with 46,508.
Other new routes launching in June 2023 include Indonesia AirAsia’s new service from Jakarta to Perth, commencing June 2. Supported by the Western Australian Government through Tourism Western Australia and Perth Airport, the service will initially run 4X-weekly and be increased in line with demand.
The route is expected to attract two-way leisure traffic, as well as students traveling to Perth to study. According to the Embassy of the Republic Indonesia, the number of Indonesian students in Australia has already reached more than 20,000 in 2023, an increase of 15,000 compared with 2022.
Long-haul LCC Zipair is also enhancing its network in June when it begins flying to SFO, which will become the Japanese airline’s second point in California and its fourth in the U.S.
The carrier, a subsidiary of Japan Airlines (JAL), intends to launch a nonstop service from its base at Tokyo Narita (NRT) using 787-8 aircraft seating 290 passengers. Service starts on June 2 and will be offered five times per week.
Zipair’s entry to the Tokyo-San Francisco market will see it become the fourth operator of nonstop passenger flights between the cities. OAG data shows that parent JAL provides daily service to SFO from both NRT and Tokyo Haneda (HND), while All Nippon Airways and United also provide the same level of service to SFO from NRT and HND.",0.9469096064567566,816,1.4471052885055542

"House Speaker nancy-pelosi” target=”_blank”>Nancy Pelosi< in 2022 despite projections of a GOP takeover.
“I’m very confident that we will win the House,” Pelosi said Friday during her weekly Capitol news conference.
Pelosi’s comments came in response to reports that even the Democrats’ campaign chief warned that if elections were held now, Republicans would win back the House.
Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), told a closed-door lunch last week that the party needs to course-correct ahead of 2022 to better promote President Biden’s agenda or else they’ll lose, Politico reported.
Pelosi has the slimmest of majorities right now with 220 Democrats to 212 Republicans and three vacancies. Republicans are bullish about winning back the House, and they have history on their side.
The party in power in the White House traditionally loses seats in Congress during the first midterm election. Former President Barack Obama famously suffered a self-described “shellacking” in 2010 after Republicans won in a landslide midterm election and retook the House just two years after his historic White House win.
Pelosi touted the strength of Democratic messaging and the authenticity of individual candidates that helped her party win control of the House in 2018. She suggested that Democrats will be using the tough odds to fuel their campaign efforts in 2022.
“I always run from behind,” Pelosi said.
Meantime, Democrats are seeking to better sell their accomplishments so far under the Biden Administration, with the Democratic National Committee even launching a new national podcast this week. Pelosi and Biden were both buoyed by a positive jobs report on Friday that showed U.S. employers added 943,000 workers to their payrolls and the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%.

"Home for Irish Setter Lovers Around the World
My boy Seamus bloated up Tuesday after lunch and thankfully I was home to recognize the symptoms so we rushed him to the emergency vet where they untwisted his stomach and performed a gastropexy. I think we were lucky and caught it very quickly as the stomach was a nice pink color, there was no necrosis and the spleen appeared fine. He came home today and as you can imagine, I'm still in a bit of shock. I've always made sure my two don't eat until an hour after our walks and no play after meals. He'll be on pain meds for 7 days and a stomach coating (sulcrate) for 5.
What can I expect going forward? He'll be 4 in January but the emerg vet tech that he should still live a long life after this.
Has anyone's dog ever experienced GDV a second time after a gastropexy? This to me is my major worry. The surgeon said bloat is still possible but it wouldn't be life threatening because of the gastropexy.
Hi Sue, I slept with Seamus in the living room last night as he's not allowed to climb stairs. He got the sofa and I slept on an air mattress. I think I probably got 2 hrs of sleep at the most as I'd awaken at every little sound thinking he was licking his incision. I only put the cone on when I leave him alone as he HATES it. This morning at 7 I put the cone on him in the kitchen before I took my girl Kelly out for her walk. When we got back the poor boy will still standing in the kitchen. I doubt if he went more than 5 steps.
I wish I knew more about his littermates and dam/sire. I actually got him for free with his CKC registration certificate when his previous owner sold his house and couldn't take him to the new place (or so he says). He's a beautiful but large boy at about 85 lbs.
At the emergency vet hospital, they obviously couldn't quote me a firm cost nor a cap unfortunately, but the emerg vet said if there were complications, it could be a minimum Cdn $5000 and up to $7000. Again, I was lucky to catch the GDV quickly and when I saw the bill was only $3800, I thought I won the lottery ha ha.
This scares the begeezus out of me as one of my boys went through this yrs. ago. The vet spent 3.5 hrs. pumping water down him and it saved him only to have him die a yr. later of bone cancer. I elevate both food and water and also moisten the dry kibble as well as quiet time before and after eating. Still scares me though. Read where some study stated happy dogs are less likely to experience this. Huh? Is there such a thing as an unhappy IS?
Terrible experience for you, Clarence. It is a relief to hear you got to him in time and have had a gastropexy performed.
In 1979 with our very first setter we were not aware of bloat/GDV. Our Copper died at the vet during the night aged just four years.
Since then this is one of my greatest worries and I take extra precautions concerning feeding regime and supervision. Despite theses precautions I always have the nagging fear knowing I can't control all situations.
I'm afraid although GDV is present in various deep chested breeds, Irish Setters are a high risk breed with some lines being more prone to it than others.
Maybe folks can post other suggestions of what they do as a precaution.
Hi Rob, great idea! I've read the same things about elevated bowls and then of course I've read the contrary that it isn't necessary. But the quiet time before and after meals has to be a given. I don't believe there is such a thing as an unhappy IS. I'm reminded of the Far Side cartoon with the 6 moods of the IS.
Hi Susan, this has always been a worry too. What precautions do you take? My two are raw fed twice a day but I have to keep on this Medi-Cal low fat gastro canned food for now. He has always been a fast eater so I'm doing 4 small meals at the moment.
I'll add my two cents, because it was a frightening problem for us, too. Our bitch Star bloated on Easter eve when she was 13. Though her age was a concern, we did do the surgery and gastroplexy based on her otherwise excellent health. Though she was suffering for at least two or three hours by the time she went into surgery (distance to the emergency surgery, time to stabilize her and initial diagnosis), there was no necrosis, and the surgery was quite straight-forward. She came home the day after Easter, quite a bit thinner. She recovered extremely well, and died this past May at age 16 1/2 of, I'd guess its best described as, infirmities of old age.We have absolutely no regrets for doing the surgery.
When she came home after her surgery, we were given a list of suggestions/precautions, though the surgeons also felt that her risk would be greatly reduced after the gastroplexy. According to her surgeons, the jury seems to be thoroughly divided on raised bowls or not, as well as on wetting the kibble or not. There are good arguments for both, both ways. However, the vets strongly emphasized what's already been said here (quiet before and after feeding). They also suggested that if she seemed particularly gassy, to give her an over the counter (human) gas remedy. I did a LOT of research on my own. One theme that kept coming up again and again was gluten intolerance in Irish. So I removed all gluten producing grains from her diet (including biscuits). Star was always a fussy eater, so finding foods for her became a real challenge. She'd be fine for two or three days, then insisted on a different meal.
I have a problem with raw food here in the US because of the way meats, particularly poultry, are processed. I also have a problem with the hormones and antibiotics that some food animals are routinely fed. What I eventually hit upon was a mixture of a grain-free, naturally sourced (ie, bison & venison) kibble combined with a whole food/partially cooked 'meatloaf', if you will. The meat is made by a gentleman local to us who happens to be a French chef, and who has a herd of golden retrievers. His meats (all locally sourced), to which he adds vegetables, fruits and herbs (also locally sourced), are formed into a loaf, then partially cooked, then frozen. It would not be hard to reproduce some of what he does with some experimentation and The Dogs All Love It. Even Miss Star would not turn away a slice of his 'chicken terrine with raspberries and sweet potato'.
Another suggestion from one of the surgeons -- if you are going to spay a bitch, it is not difficult for the vet to do a prophylactic gastroplexy at the same time. This particular surgeon said she did it on all her dogs when she spayed them.
A final food for thought - Star's father died of bloat and was well known to suffer from it. I haven't found any solid Irish-specific research tracing lines and incidences of GDV, but there does seem to be a suggestion of potential congenital risk factors. Since Star's father certainly produced quite a few off-spring, it seems that a good (though probably anonymous due to kennel sensitivities) avenue of research would be to look into the incidence of bloat in well-used sires -- they do tend to appear more frequently in pedigrees than the bitches who may only be used once or twice.
Interesting that your girl Star was a fussy eater! My only bloater is (was) a fussy eater too!! Milo always had a gas problem, but it only happened when he was very stressed(usually at the groomers!) and only a couple of times a year.He always deflated on his own, so I just watched him any time this happened! But this year he did have an episode with much different symptoms than usual(no gas, but a lot of discomfort!!) and I rushed him to the vets with suspected torsion, and my vet operated on him quickly, so thankfully there was no damage and she stapled his stomach to his abdominal wall, so he should have less chance of torsion again!
Since this operation I switched Milo to a raw diet and for the first time in 7 years he has became a good eater and actually gained an extra 3kgs(he was always a bit too thin)And I still continue the rule of no exercise 2 hours before or after eating! I dont elevate dishes and never have, as I dont believe it makes any difference!!
Clarence I'm sure Seamus will be just fine after his surgery!
My current boy, Se, is well known for his burps - he does it at judges, when he just feels like it - kind of, well, like a teenage boy, delighting in the music he can bring forth with a belch. He can also fart to clear a room if he's been into something he shouldn't (like mouse hunting in the garbage). ""Better out than in"" - but it is a worry, subconsciously, one experience with bloat is more than enough.. He learned to be a persnickety eater from Star, though he will also follow his stomach far more than she ever would.He is not a dog that I worry if his food isn't locked down and (except for the very occasional counter surf) I don't worry too much about food on the counter that he might steal (he generally won't, he deviously waits for the four month human complacency to set in).
He's on the diet she was on for the last three years of her life, and people are actually shocked at how little he eats to maintain weight/coat/condition He's far from a couch potato - he gets a *hard* run for two hours a day. And will be going back to field trials in January, where his caloric needs go through the roof. *I* think it is the whole food component to the meatloaf - which is also a component of a raw diet More bio-available digestible stuff that his body can use, rather than stuff that passes through for me to pick up out of the yard. He's going to stay on that diet when he goes back to field trialing. . .and I can boost the fat content through the same diet.
I just wish more targeted research would go towards bloat - so many of our Irish go into pet homes where the signs aren't recognized early enough, and it does seem to be a problem for them. I hate the ""raised bowls or not"" kind of argument - we need to have definitive answers so we can establish a good working protocol to *really* prevent it.
Hi Cornelia, can you give details where this study comes from? I'd be interested how many dogs of each breed were included in the study.
Hi Eva, what are you feeding your dogs? Before the bloat, Seamus and Kelly were raw fed. Kelly is still on raw but the surgeon told me to feed Seamus this canned Medi-Cal low fat gastro which as you can imagine is probably just good enough as opposed to being very good for Seamus. It's also $3/can and at his size, he is supposed to get 4 cans a day so it's going to get expensive very quickly. He gets his stomach staples out in 2 weeks where I'll discuss his diet with the surgeon then. I'm not opposed to a high quality grain and citric acid free kibble but ideally he would be back on the raw diet. The surgeon did a gastrostomy (incision) on the stomach
to remove objects from within the stomach, which were observed to be pieces of bone, a heart and other animal organs.
I had to explain to them that that was his lunch. My concern is that because they had to open up his stomach and then sew it back up, the last thing I want to do is feed him something that could get caught in the stomach stitches. I really don't know how fast that incision heals or if indeed it ever heals so I'm going with the canned, formless food for the next few weeks.",0.9882650971412659,2609,0.6439436078071594

"This is meat from cattle that only consumes grass, throughout their lifetime. This is the best method of keeping animals because they will not acquire chemicals that may affect their bodies. People will like this meat as they will be safe from the effects that are brought about by the chemicals in the meat. They will also have the ability to safeguard themselves from effects of hormones that maybe brought by taking meat from animals that had been introduced to them. A reduction in the amount of calories is implemented by taking this type of beef.
When feeding on normal beef, the amount of calories that are built in the body are high. If one moves from taking the normal beef to grass-fed beef, they will depreciate the high amount of calories. It helps to regulate the bulk and figure of the body. This will aid at the reduction in chances of getting infections like heart attack that are brought about by the high amount of calories in the body. This king of beef will aid at providing the body with the best blood sugar level. This is possible as these are some fatty acids in the beef that are effective in dealing with diabetes and obesity. This will be to the benefit of the people that are living with these deseases.
Due to the effectiveness in the production of insulin, people taking this kind of beef will be able to control their blood sugar level in the blood. With the company of ketogenic salts, grass-fed beef will help in production of more energy. This is most appropriate for those who do hard jobs that require a lot of energy. The beef also produces some levels of electrolytes. This is most useful to those people who begin their keto lifestyle. It produces electrolytes that are most needed by the bodies of those who have adapted the keto life. The reason is that it is important to replenish the electrolytes after flashing them out through the keto diet.
One will also have the ability to fight cancer, which is a risky disease. This is so because this kind of meat is unique as it has conjugated linoleic acid, which is an anticancer nutrient. This provides a natural way of preventing deadly diseases. This beef will also produce a significant amount of fats that are healthy to the body. They have great amount of omega-3 fats that helps in effecting the functions of the brain.
The grass-fed beef will also contain much less levels of bacteria. This is because other beef that take mixed types of foods have high levels of bacteria from those feeds.

"A notary public in Boon Keng is a public servant appointed by a state official. The general focus of his or her job is to witness the documents’ verification and administer oaths. They serve to deter fraud, appearing as an impartial witness for legal documents such as affidavits, deeds or powers of attorney. The presence of a notary public helps to screen for imposters and make sure both parties are entering into an agreement knowingly and willingly.
Similarly, legalization is the process of proper authentication or screening of documents or the notary by the high commission or the embassy or the consulate of the country in which the document is to be used is authorized to or located in Singapore. In simple terms, it is the official confirmation of the originality of the documents or we can say that document legalization is just the confirmation that the stamp, seal or the signature showing in the document is genuine and not a fraud.
Boon Keng Notary Public Service Locations
The affidavit is a written version of sworn statement: a voluntary oath before a notary public, judge or commissioner of deed, all of whom are authorized to administer oaths. Both the affiant and the authorized officer are required to sign the affidavit.
The affidavit is also a useful tool in rectifying inadvertently wrongful data.
A simple example of an affidavit is the ""Affidavit of Two Disinterested Persons"" purposely to facilitate the correction of another person's name. These two (2) particular disinterested persons issuing the affidavit are usually older close acquaintances of the other person's family. The affidavit they swear to will explicitly state that they both know that the person seeking the correction of name is one and the same as that person they know since childhood years, etc. etc.
The affidavit speaks for a person and of a person. Depending on the motives by which an affidavit is presented, affidavits can either be moral or immoral. Affidavits can be good or bad.
Affidavits, however legalese it can get, is also an affirmation of a person's being. An affidavit can actually bares one's soul for the world to know - better or worse.
The use and abuse of affidavits is common. Affidavits can make or break anyone. Affidavits can build or ruin an empire. Why? Affidavits spin off court litigations, small or great. Affidavit could be that minute cog of the big machine of justice or injustice. Take your pick!
What is a Commissioner For Oaths?
A notary public is an officer chosen at the state level to serve as an impartial witness to the signing of documents. Dependent on the state in question, he also offers a number of other services such as administering of oaths, fingerprinting and wedding services. Notaries take a fee set by their state for these services. Notary public rates may vary from state to state.
In Maryland, a notary can demand and receive a fee of not more than $2 for the performance of an original notarial deed. He may demand not more than $1 for each signature on each extra copy of the original document. A notary can receive up to 25¢ per mile and a fee not exceeding $5, as compensation for travel in the performance of a notarial act. Unless otherwise allowed by law, notary public rates may not go beyond this amount.
A notary public who charges more than the maximum declared by each state subjects himself to possible criminal action. Suspension or revocation of the notary public commission by the Secretary of State's office is also possible.",0.950806200504303,732,2.12882399559021

The chief thing in the doctrine of Marx is that it brings out the historic role of the proletariat as the builder of socialist society. Has the course of events all over the world confirmed this doctrine since it was expounded by Marx?
Marx first advanced it in 1844. The Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels, published in 1848, gave an integral and systematic exposition of this doctrine, an exposition which has remained the best to this day. Since then world history has clearly been divided into three main periods: (1) from the revolution of 1848 to the Paris Commune (1871); (2) from the Paris Commune to the Russian revolution (1905); (3) since the Russian revolution. Let us see what has been the destiny of Marx's doctrine in each of these periods.
At the beginning of the first period Marx's doctrine by no means dominated. It was only one of the very numerous groups or trends of socialism. The forms of socialism that did dominate were in the main akin to our Narodism: in comprehension of the materialist basis of historical movement, inability to single out the role and significance of each class in capitalist society, concealment of the bourgeois nature of democratic reforms under diverse, quasi-socialist phrases about the ""people"", ""justice"", ""right"", and so on.
The revolution of 1848 struck a deadly blow at all these vociferous, motley and ostentatious forms of pre-Marxian
socialism. In all countries, the revolution revealed the various classes of society in action. The shooting of the workers by the republican bourgeoisie in Paris in the June days of 1848 finally revealed that the proletariat alone was socialist by nature. The liberal bourgeoisie dreaded the independence of this class a hundred times more than it did any kind of reaction. The craven liberals grovelled before reaction. The peasantry were content with the abolition of the survivals of feudalism and joined the supporters of order, wavering but occasionally between workers' democracy and bourgeois liberalism. All doctrines of non-cIass socialism and non-class politics proved to be sheer nonsense.
The Paris Commune (1871) completed this development of bourgeois changes; the republic, i.e., the form of political organisation in which class relations appear in their most unconcealed form, owed its consolidation solely to the heroism of the proletariat.
In all the other European countries, a more tangled and less complete development led to the same result -- a bourgeois society that had taken definite shape. Towards the end of the first period (1848-71), a period of storms and revolutions, pre-Marxian socialism was dead. Independent proletarian parties came into being: the First International (1864-72) and the German Social-Democratic Party.
The second period (1872-1904) was distinguished from the first by its ""peaceful"" character, by the absence of revolutions. The West had finished with bourgeois revolutions. The East had not yet risen to them.
The West entered a phase of ""peaceful"" preparations for the changes to come. Socialist parties, basically proletarian, were formed everywhere, and learned to use bourgeois parliamentarism and to found their own daily press, their educational institutions, their trade unions and their co-operative societies. Marx's doctrine gained a complete victory and began to spread. The selection and mustering of the forces of the proletariat and its preparation for the coming battles made slow but steady progress.
The dialectics of history were such that the theoretical victory of Marxism compelled its enemies to disguise themselves as Marxists. Liberalism, rotten within, tried to revive itself in the form of socialist opportunism. They interpreted the period of preparing the forces for great battles as renunciation of these battles. Improvement of the conditions of the slaves to fight against wage slavery they took to mean the sale by the slaves of their right to liberty for a few pence. They cravenly preached ""social peace"" (i.e., peace with the slave-owners), renunciation of the class struggle, etc. They had very many adherents among socialist members of parliament, various officials of the working-class movement, and the ""sympathising"" intelligentsia.
However, the opportunists had scarcely congratulated themselves on ""social peace"" and on the non-necessity of storms under ""democracy "" when a new source of great world storms opened up in Asia. The Russian revolution was followed by revolutions in Turkey, Persia and China. It is in this era of storms and their ""repercussions"" in Europe that we are now living. No matter what the fate of the great Chinese republic, against which various ""civilised"" hyenas are now whetting their teeth, no power on earth can restore the old serfdom in Asia or wipe out the heroic democracy of the masses in the Asiatic and semi-Asiatic countries.
Certain people who were inattentive to the conditions for preparing and developing the mass struggle were driven to despair and to anarchism by the lengthy delays in the decisive struggle against capitalism in Europe. We can now see how short-sighted and faint-hearted this anarchist despair is.
The fact that Asia, with its population of eight hundred million, has been drawn into the struggle for these same European ideals should inspire us with optimism and not despair.
The Asiatic revolutions have again shown us the spinelessness and baseness of liberalism, the exceptional
importance of the independence of the democratic masses, and the pronounced demarcation between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie of all kinds. After the experience both of Europe and Asia, anyone who speaks of non-class politics and non-class socialism, ought simply to be put in a cage and exhibited alongside the Australian kangaroo or something like that.
After Asia, Europe has also begun to stir, although not in the Asiatic way. The ""peaceful"" period of 1872-1904 has passed, never to return. The high cost of living and the tyranny of the trusts are leading to an unprecedented sharpening of the economic struggle, which has set into movement even the British workers who have been most corrupted by liberalism. We see a political crisis brewing even in the most ""diehard"", bourgeois-Junker country, Germany. The frenzied arming and the policy of imperialism are turning modern Europe into a ""social peace"" which is more like a gunpowder barrel. Meanwhile the decay of all the bourgeois parties and the maturing of the proletariat are making steady progress.
Since the appearance of Marxism, each of the three great periods of world history has brought Marxism new confirmation and new triumphs. But a still greater triumph awaits Marxism, as the doctrine of the proletariat, in the coming period of history.

The Left-wing Social-Democrats must reconsider the question of boycotting the State Duma. It should be borne in mind that we have always presented this question concretely, and in connection with a definite political situation. For instance, Proletary (Geneva) wrote that ""it would be ridiculous to renounce utilising even the Bulygin Duma""[*] -- if it could come into being. And in referring to the Witte Duma in the pamphlet Social-Democracy and the State Duma (by N. Lenin and F. Dan), N. Lenin wrote: ""We must by all means carefully reconsider the question of tactics. . . . The situation has changed"" at the time of the Bulygin Duma (see p . 2 of the pamphlet cited).**
The principal difference between revolutionary Social-Democracy and opportunist Social-Democracy on the question of boycott is as follows: the opportunists in all circumstances confine themselves to applying the stereotyped method copied from a specific period in the history of German socialism. We must utilise representative institutions; the Duma is a representative institution; therefore boycott is anarchism, and we must go into the Duma. All the arguments used by our Mensheviks, and especially by Plekhanov, on this topic, could be reduced to this childishly simple syllogism. The Menshevik resolution on the importance of representative institutions in a revolutionary period (see Partiiniye Izvestia, No. 2) strikingly reveals the stereotyped and anti-historical nature of their argument.
The revolutionary Social-Democrats, on the contrary, lay chief emphasis on the necessity of carefully appraising the concrete political situation. It is impossible to cope with the tasks of the revolutionary epoch in Russia by copying in a biased manner one of the recent German stereotyped patterns, forgetting the lessons of 1847-48. The progress of our revolution will be altogether incomprehensible if we confine ourselves to making bare contrasts between ""anarchist"" boycott and Social-Democratic participation in elections. Learn from the history of the Russian revolution, gentlemen!
This history has proved that the tactics of boycotting the Bulygin Duma were the only correct tactics at that time, and were entirely justified by events. Whoever forgets this and argues about boycott without taking the lessons of the Bulygin Duma into account (as the Mensheviks always do) is certifying his own mental poverty, his inability to explain and take into account one of the most important and eventful periods of the Russian revolution. The tactics of boycotting the Bulygin Duma were based on a correct appraisal of the temper of the revolutionary proletariat and of the objective features of the situation, which made an immediate general outbreak inevitable.
Let us pass to the second lesson of history -- to the Witte, Cadet Duma. Nowadays we often hear Social-Democratic intellectuals making repentant speeches about the boycott of that Duma. The fact that it did assemble and undoubtedly rendered indirect service to the revolution is considered to be sufficient reason for penitently confessing that the boycott of the Witte Duma had been a mistake.
Such a view, however, is extremely biased and short-sighted. It fails to take into consideration a number of very important facts of the period prior to the Witte Duma, the period of its existence and the period after its dissolution. Remember that the electoral law for that Duma was promulgated on December 11, at a time when the insurgents were waging an armed fight for a constituent assembly. Remember that even the Menshevik ""Nachalo "" wrote at the time: ""The proletariat will also sweep away the Witte Duma, just as it swept away the Bulygin Duma."" Under such circumstances the proletariat could not and should not have
surrendered to the tsar without a fight the power to convene the first representative assembly in Russia. The proletariat had to fight against the autocracy being strengthened by a loan on the security of the Witte Duma. The proletariat had to combat the constitutional illusions which, in the spring of 1906, formed the entire basis of the election campaign of the Cadets and the elections among the peasantry. At that time, when the importance of the Duma was being immeasurably exaggerated, the only means of combating such illusions was the boycott. The degree to which the spread of constitutional illusions was connected with participation in the election campaign and in the elections in the spring of 1906 is strikingly revealed by the attitude adopted by our Mensheviks. Suffice it to recall that, in spite of the warnings of the Bolsheviks, in the resolution of the Fourth (Unity) Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party the Duma was referred to as a ""power ""! Another instance: with complete self-assurance, Plekhanov wrote: ""The government will fall into the abyss when it dissolves the Duma."" In reply to him it was said at that time: we must prepare to push the enemy into the abyss and not, like the Cadets, place hopes on its ""falling"" into the abyss by itself. And how soon the words then uttered were proved correct!*
It was the duty of the proletariat to exert every effort to preserve the independence of its tactics in our revolution, namely: together with the politically conscious peasantry against the vacillating and treacherous liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie. But it was impossible to employ these tactics during the elections to the Witte Duma owing to a number of circumstances, both objective and subjective, which, in the vast majority of localities in Russia, would have made participation in the elections tantamount to the workers' party tacitly supporting the Cadets. The proletariat could not and should not have adopted half-hearted and artificially concocted tactics, prompted by ""cunning"" and confusion, of elections for an unknown purpose, of elections to the Duma, but not for the Duma. And yet it is a historical fact, which cannot be abolished by the silence, subterfuges and evasions of the Mensheviks, that not one
of them, not even Plekhanov, dared advocate in the press that we should go into the Duma. It is a fact that not a single call was issued in the press to go into the Duma. It is a fact that the Mensheviks themselves, in the leaflet issued by the Joint Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., officially recognised the boycott and confined the dispute only to the question of the stage at which the boycott was to be adopted. It is a fact that the Mensheviks laid emphasis, not on the elections to the Duma, but on the elections as such, and even on the process of electing as a means of organising for an uprising and for sweeping away the Duma. Events proved, however, that it was impossible to carry on mass agitation during the elections, and that the Duma alone provided certain opportunities for carrying on agitation among the masses.
Whoever really makes an effort to consider and weigh all these complicated facts, both objective and subjective, will see that the Caucasus was only an exception which proved the general rule. He will see that contrite speeches and explaining away the boycott as a piece of ""youthful impetuousness"" reveal an extremely narrow, superficial and short-sighted estimate of events.
The dissolution of the Duma has now clearly demonstrated that in the conditions prevailing in the spring of 1906 the boycott, on the whole, was the right tactics and advantageous. Under the conditions which then prevailed, only by means of the boycott could the Social-Democrats fulfil their duty of giving the people the necessary warning against the tsar's constitution and supplying the necessary criticism of the chicanery of the Cadets during the elections; and both (warning and criticism) were strikingly confirmed by the dissolution of the Duma.
Here is a small instance to illustrate the above. In the spring of 1906, Mr. Vodovozov, who is half-Cadet and half-Menshevik, was whole-heartedly in favour of participating in the elections and supporting the Cadets. Yesterday (August 11) he wrote in Tovarishch  that the Cadets ""wanted to be a parliamentary party in a country that has no parliament and a constitutional party in a country that has no constitution""; that ""the whole character of the Cadet Party has been determined by the fundamental contradiction be-
tween a radical programme and quite non-radical tactics"".
The Bolsheviks could not desire a greater triumph than this admission on the part of a Left Cadet or Right-wing Plekhanovite.
However, while absolutely rejecting faint-hearted and short-sighted speeches of repentance, as well as the silly explanation of the boycott as ""youthful impetuousness"", we do not by any means reject the new lessons of the Cadet Duma. It would be pedantic obstinacy to be afraid of frankly admitting these new lessons and taking them into account. History has shown that when the Duma assembles opportunities arise for carrying on useful agitation both from within the Duma and around it; that the tactics of joining forces with the revolutionary peasantry against the Cadets can be applied in the Duma. This may seem paradoxical, but such, undoubtedly, is the irony of history: it was the Cadet Duma that clearly demonstrated to the masses the correctness of what we might briefly describe as ""anti-Cadet"" tactics. History has ruthlessly confuted all constitutional illusions and all ""faith in the Duma""; but history has undoubtedly proved that that institution is of some, although modest, use to the revolution as a platform for agitation, for exposing the true ""inner nature"" of the political parties, etc.
Hence the conclusion: it would be ridiculous to shut our eyes to realities. The time has now come when the revolutionary Social-Democrats must cease to be boycottists. We shall not refuse to go into the Second Duma when (or ""if"") it is convened. We shall not refuse to utilise this arena, but we shall not exaggerate its modest importance; on the contrary, guided by the experience already provided by history, we shall entirely subordinate the struggle we wage in the Duma to another form of struggle, namely, strikes, uprisings, etc. We shall convene the Fifth Party Congress; there we shall resolve that in the event of elections taking place, it will be necessary to enter into an electoral agreement, for a few weeks, with the Trudoviks (unless the Fifth Party Congress is convened it will be impossible to conduct a united election campaign; and ""blocs with other parties"" are absolutely prohibited by the decision of the Fourth Congress). And then we shall utterly rout the Cadets.
This conclusion, however, does not by any means reveal the whole complexity of the task that confronts us. We deliberately emphasised the words ""in the event of elections taking place"", etc. We do not know yet whether the Second Duma will be convened, when the elections will take place, what the electoral laws will be like, or what the situation will be at that time. Hence our conclusion suffers from being extremely general: we need it to enable us to sum up past experience, to take note of the lessons of the past, to put the forthcoming questions of tactics on a proper basis; but it is totally inadequate for solving the concrete problems of immediate tactics.
Only Cadets and the ""Cadet-like"" people of all sorts can be satisfied with such a conclusion at the present time, can create a ""slogan"" for themselves out of the yearnings for a new Duma and try to persuade the government of the desirability of convening it as quickly as possible, etc. Only conscious or unconscious traitors to the revolution would at the present time exert all efforts to divert the inevitable new rise of temper and excitement into the channel of an election and not into that of a fight waged by means of a general strike and uprising.
This brings us to the crux of the question of present-day Social-Democratic tactics. The issue now is not whether we should take part in the elections. To say ""yes"" or ""no"" in this case means saying nothing at all about the fundamental problem of the moment. Outwardly, the political situation in August 1906 is similar to that in August 1905, but enormous progress has been made during this period: the forces that are fighting on the respective sides, the forms of the struggle, and the time required for carrying out this or that strategic move -- if we may so express it -- have all become more exactly defined.
The government's plan is clear. It was absolutely right in its calculations when it fixed the date of the convocation of the Duma and did not fix -- contrary to the law -- the date of the elections. The government does not want to tie its hands or show its cards. Firstly, it is gaining time in which to consider an amendment of the electoral law. Secondly -- and this is the most important -- it is keeping the date of the elections in reserve until the character and intensity of
the new rise of temper can be fully gauged. The government wishes to fix the date of the elections at the particular time (and perhaps in the particular form, i.e., the form of elections) when it can split and paralyse the incipient uprising. The government's reasoning is correct: if things remain quiet, perhaps we shall not convene the Duma at all, or revert to the Bulygin laws. If, however, a strong movement arises, then we can try to split it by fixing a date for the elections for the time being and in this way entice certain cowards and simpletons away from the direct revolutionary struggle.
Liberal blockheads (see Tovarishch and Rech ) so utterly fail to understand the situation that they are of their own accord crawling into the net set by the government. They are trying with might and main ""to prove"" the need for the Duma and the desirability of diverting the rising tide into the channel of an election. But even they cannot deny that the question of what form the impending struggle will assume is still an open one. Today's issue of Rech (August 12) admits: ""What the peasants will say in the autumn . . . is still unknown."" . . . ""It will be difficult to make any general forecasts until September-October, when the temper of the peasantry is definitely revealed.""
The liberal bourgeois remain true to their nature. They do not want to assist actively in choosing the form of the struggle and in moulding the temper of the peasants one way or another, nor are they capable of doing so. The interests of the bourgeoisie demand that the old regime be not overthrown, but merely weakened, and that a liberal Cabinet be formed.
The interests of the proletariat demand the complete overthrow of the old, tsarist regime and the convocation of a constituent assembly with full power. Its interests demand the most active intervention in moulding the temper of the peasants, in choosing the most resolute forms of struggle as well as the best moment for it. On no account must we with draw, or obscure, the slogan: convocation of a constituent assembly by revolutionary means, i.e., through the medium of a provisional revolutionary government. We must concentrate all efforts on explaining the conditions for an uprising: that it must be combined with the strike movement;
that all the revolutionary forces must be rallied and prepared for it, etc. We must resolutely take the path that was indicated in the well-known manifestoes: ""To the Army and Navy"" and ""To All the Peasants"", which were signed by the ""bloc"" of all revolutionary organisations, including the Trudovik Group. Lastly, we must take special care that the government does not under any circumstances succeed in splitting, stopping, or weakening the incipient uprising by ordering elections. In this respect the lessons of the Cadet Duma must be absolutely binding for us, viz., the lessons that the Duma campaign is a subordinate and secondary form of struggle, and that, owing to the objective conditions of the moment, direct revolutionary actions by the broad mass of the people still remain the principal form of struggle.
Of course, subordinating the Duma campaign to the main struggle, assigning a secondary role to this campaign for the contingency of an unfavourable outcome of the battle, or postponing the battle until experience of the Second Duma is obtained -- such tactics may, if you like, be described as the old boycott tactics. On formal grounds this description might be justified, because, apart from the work of agitation and propaganda, which is always obligatory, ""preparation for elections"" consists of minute technical arrangements, which can very rarely be made a long time before the elections. We do not want to argue about words; in substance these tactics are the logical development of the old tactics, but not a repetition of them; they are a deduction drawn from the last boycott, but not the last boycott itself.
To sum up. We must take into account the experience of the Cadet Duma and spread its lessons among the masses. We must prove to them that the Duma is ""useless"", that a constituent assembly is essential, that the Cadets are wavering; we must demand that the Trudoviks throw off the yoke of the Cadets, and we must support the former against the latter. We must recognise at once the need for an electoral agreement between the Social-Democrats and the Trudoviks in the event of new elections taking place. We must exert all our efforts to counteract the government's plan to split the uprising by ordering elections. Advocating their tried revolutionary slogans with greater energy than ever, Social-
Democrats must exert every effort to unite all the revolutionary elements and classes more closely, to convert the upsurge that is probable in the near future into an armed uprising of the whole people against the tsarist government.

Notes on |
Proletary (The Proletarian ) -- an illegal Bolshevik weekly, official organ of the R.S.D.L.P., founded in accordance with a resolution of the Third Congress of the Party. Lenin was appointed editor-in-chief by a decision of a plenary session of the Party's Central Committee, on April 27 (May 10), 1905.
Partiiniye Izvestia (Party News ) -- a newspaper, the organ of the Joint Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., which was published illegally in St. Petersburg on the eve of the Fourth (Unity) Congress of the Party. Two issues were brought out: those of February 7 (20) and March 20 (April 2), 1906. The editorial board was composed on an equal basis of editors of the Bolshevik organ (Proletary ) and the Menshevik organ (the new Iskra ). The Bolshevik members of the editorial board included Lenin, Lunacharsky and others.
Lenin's articles ""The Present Situation in Russia and the Tactics of the Workers' Party"", ""The Russian Revolution and the Tasks of the Proletariat"" were printed in Partiiniye Izvestia over the signature ""Bolshevik"" (see present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 112-19, 135-45). After the Congress, publication of the newspaper was discontinued.
The Law of December 11 (24), 1905, was the law on elections to the State Duma. By it the voters were divided into four curias: agricultural (landlords), urban (bourgeoisie), peasant and workers'. One landlord vote was made equivalent in value to three votes of urban bourgeois representatives, 15 peasant votes or 45 workers'
votes. The law ensured the huge preponderance of the clique of landlords and capitalists in the Duma.
Tovarishch (The Comrade ) -- a bourgeois daily newspaper published in St. Petersburg from March 1906 to January 1908. Formally, it was not the organ of any party, but in effect it was an organ of the Left Cadets. Mensheviks also contributed to the newspaper.
Proletary was published in Geneva from May 14 (27) till November 12 (25), 1905, a total of twenty-six issues being brought out. Active in the work of the editorial board were V. V. Vorovsky, A. V. Lunacharsky and M. S. Olminsky. Proletary continued the policy of the old, Leninist Iskra, and maintained full continuity with the Bolshevik newspaper Vperyod.
Lenin wrote more than 50 articles and items for Proletary, his articles being reprinted in local Bolshevik periodicals, and also published in the form of leaflets.
Publication of Proletary was discontinued shortly after Lenin's departure for Russia in November 1905, the last two issues (Nos. 25 and 26) being edited by V. V. Vorovsky.",0.9601884484291077,4531,1.9679509401321411

FROM THE NOTES OF A SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC PUBLICIST
St Petersburg, January 15, 1907
The bourgeois press is now gossiping and cackling over the resolutions of the St. Petersburg Social-Democratic Conference. The liberals, from the pompous official organ Rech to the gutter rag Segodnya, are united in a general chorus of jubilation over the split caused by the Mensheviks, of triumph at the return of these prodigal sons of ""society"" to the fold of the ""opposition bloc"", at their emancipation from ""revolutionary illusions"".
Social-Democrats who are really on the side of the revolutionary proletariat would do well to ask: ""But who are the judges?""
Let us take what is perhaps the best of these judges, Rodnaya Zemlya, of January 15. The trend of this newspaper is undoubtedly more Left than that of the Cadets. Judging from all the facts, it may be called a Trudovik trend. As documentary confirmation of this political estimate we may point out that Mr. Tan is a contributor to that newspaper. Mr. Tan's name is in the published list of members of the organising committee of the ""Trudovik (Popular Socialist) Party"".
And so, the judges are the Trudoviks.
They condemn the Bolsheviks, and, like the Cadets, approve the plan of the Mensheviks. They disagree with the Cadets only in that they object to the latter getting more than two or three seats in the general bloc of all the Left parties.
Such is the verdict. Let us examine the grounds.
""The controversy undoubtedly centres on the question whether there is or is not a Black-Hundred danger in St. Petersburg.""
That is not true. If you take it upon yourselves to judge the Bolshevik Social-Democrats in a leading article of a political newspaper, it is your duty to know what you are judging. In that leading article you yourselves say: ""The controversy that has now flared up over the resolutions of the [Social-Democratic] conference is undoubtedly one of public interest."" People who express the wish publicly to participate in a controversy of general interest and at once betray their ignorance of the ""centre"" of the controversy run the risk of having a none too flattering appellation hurled at them. . . .
The revolutionary Social-Democrats have repeatedly explained and insisted in all their numerous political declarations that the so-called Black-Hundred danger cannot be regarded as the ""centre"" of the controversy over election tactics.
Why not? Because the tactics of the workers' party during the elections must be only the application to a particular case of the general principles of the socialist tactics of the proletariat. Elections are only one of the fields, and by no means the most important, most essential one (particularly in a revolutionary period), in which the socialist proletariat wages the struggle for liberty and for the abolition of all exploitation. In addition to the one waged with the aid of ballot papers, there is another type of struggle, which inevitably flares up in times of revolution. This other struggle is apt to be forgotten by intellectuals who imagine that they are men of education, whose sympathies for liberty lie no deeper than the tips of their tongues. And it is apt to be forgotten by the small proprietors, who stand aloof from the bitter, everyday struggle against capital and its henchmen. But the proletarian does not forget about it.
Therefore, for the class-conscious proletarian, election tactics can only be an adaptation of his general tactics to a particular struggle, namely, the election struggle; under no circumstances does this imply a change in the principles of his tactics, or the shifting of the ""centre"" of these tactics
The basis of socialist tactics in time of revolution consists in the progressive class, the proletariat, marching at the head of the people's revolution (the revolution that is now taking place in Russia is a bourgeois revolution in the sense that the attainment of complete freedom and all the land for the people will not rid us in the least of the rule of the bourgeoisie; obviously, the fact that the revolution has this socio-economic character does not prevent it from being a people's revolution). The progressive class must therefore consistently expose to the masses the falsity of all hopes of negotiations and agreements with the old regime in general, and of agreements between landlords and peasants over the land question in particular. The progressive class must pursue its independent line of undeviating struggle, supporting only those who are really fighting, and only to the extent that they fight.
Such are the basic principles of socialist tactics, which dictate to the workers' party class independence as the rule, and collaboration and agreements only with the revolutionary bourgeoisie, and only as an exception.
The liberals do not understand these principles of Social-Democratic tactics. The idea of class struggle is foreign to them; the idea of contrasting a people's revolution to deals and negotiations is repugnant to them. But in principle all Social-Democrats, Bolsheviks and even Mensheviks, accept these tactics. The Trudoviks, who undertake to edit a political organ without knowing the ABC of the contemporary tactical problems of socialism, can read about this even in the election platform of the Social-Democratic Party -- the platform of the Mensheviks, who predominate in the Central Committee.
""Citizens,"" states this platform, ""you should elect to the Duma people who not only want liberty for Russia, but are anxious to help the people's revolution to achieve it. . . . The majority in the First Duma, led by the party of 'people's freedom', hoped to obtain liberty and land by means of peaceful negotiations with the government. . . . Citizens! Elect fighters for the revolution, who, shoulder to shoulder with you, will continue the great cause that was initiated in January, October and December last year (1905).""
The ""centre of the controversy"", which our Trudoviks have totally failed to grasp, is whether agreements with the Cadets can be sanctioned in principle from this point of view. The St. Petersburg Social-Democratic Conference answered this question in the negative, as the 14 delegates of the All-Russian Conference (of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party) had done before them. No agreements can be tolerated with a party which is bargaining and parleying with the old regime. The Cadets cannot be our allies in the ""people's revolution"". Their admission to the ranks of the ""fighters for the revolution"" would not strengthen but weaken these fighters, whose work is being hindered by the Cadets, who are now openly opposing the struggle and all revolutionary slogans.
In failing to see the principle underlying the attitude of the Bolshevik Social-Democrats towards the Cadets, our judges have failed to notice the ""elephant"".
These Trudoviks are entirely under the ideological influence of the bourgeois liberals. The elections have over-shadowed everything for them; election results have over-shadowed the task of enlightening the masses in the course of the election campaign. They have no idea how important it is for a Social-Democrat to carry on perfectly clear, definite and unambiguous election agitation if he is to remain true to his principles, loyal to his revolutionary standpoint in spite of all efforts to tempt him with the prospect of a seat in the Duma, or to frighten him with the prospect of not winning a single seat in the capital. Absorbed in the liberals' scrapping, the Trudoviks have forgotten all principles, they have forgotten all the fundamental objects of the revolution. They see nothing, understand nothing, care for nothing, and only keep on muttering: ""one seat, two seats, three seats""!
. . . ""The controversy . . . centres on . . . whether there is a Black-Hundred danger in St. Petersburg."". . .
So you reduce the Black-Hundred danger to the danger of a Black-Hundred victory in elections faked by the government! Cannot you understand, gentlemen, that by putting the question in this way, you are admitting that the government is already victorious, and that the cause of liberty,
which you prate about so much, is already lost? You yourselves do not see, and you are preventing the masses of the people from seeing, the real Black-Hundred danger, which is manifested not in the voting, but in the definition of the conditions of voting (the Senate interpretations and the impending repeal of the electoral law of December 11), in the nullification of the results of voting (the dissolution of the Duma). You are entirely adopting the vulgar liberal point of view and are concentrating your minds -- and the minds of the mass of the people whom you are misleading -- on struggle within the limits of a fake law which is being still further faked. You fail to see the Black-Hundred danger in the form of the possible arrest of all the electors. You throw away that which depends on you, and wholly on you, which is at any rate a lasting and substantial asset to the revolution, namely: the development of the revolutionary spirit of the masses by consistent agitation. On the other hand, what you are chasing after depends not on you, but on the artifices of Stolypin, on a new Senate interpretation, on further violations of the electoral law by the police. Consequently, you are fighting the ""Black-Hundred danger"" in exactly the same way as the French bourgeois republicans are fighting the monarchist danger; namely, by strengthening monarchist institutions and the monarchist constitution within the republic. For, by instilling into the minds of the people the idea that the Black-Hundred danger is the danger of an increased Black-Hundred vote, you are perpetuating the ignorance of the most backward masses as to the real source and real nature of the Black-Hundred danger.
But let us proceed. Let us assume that there will be no further Senate interpretations concerning the elections and the electors. Let us take the question of the parties that may win the elections in St. Petersburg under the existing electoral system.
The Trudoviks cannot deny that the parties of the Right have been seriously compromised; that the Union of October Seventeenth is suffering defeat after defeat, each more ignominious than the last; that ""of late the Octobrists have completely subsided, stunned by heavy blows from the Left""; that ""the public has swung to the Left"".
But . . . Shchedrin long ago translated this ""but"" of the Russian liberals into intelligible language: ""ears will never grow higher than foreheads, never!"" -- but ""technical difficulties"", ""literature is not being delivered"", ""they won't give us ballot papers"", ""police restrictions"". . . .
There you have the psychology of the Russian intellectual: in words he is a bold radical, in deeds he is a contemptible little government official.
The remedy for police restrictions is supposed to lie in blocs with the Cadets! Why not blocs with the Octobrists, who ""want"" a constitution, and are sure of not being subjected to ""restrictions""? Truly Russian political logic: electoral agreements to combat the failure of the post-office to deliver literature, to combat the refusal to issue ballot papers. . . . What are you combating, gentlemen?
The ""laws"" which sanction the outrageous conduct of the police, which declare certain parties to be ""illegal"" and deprive them of ballot papers. How are you combating them?
Why, of course, by means of an agreement with a party which will either obtain ballot papers from the Peaceful Renovators, or come to terms with Stolypin before the Duma opens, or else will also be left without ballot papers!
The Russian government official (a radical at twenty, a liberal at thirty, and simply an official at forty) is accustomed to play the liberal when at home and make threatening gestures where nobody can see him. He thinks the election campaign should be-fought along these same lines. Influence the masses? Nonsense, the post-office refuses to deliver our literature.
Publish and distribute literature without the ""post-office"" and similar institutions?
Nonsense! These are obsolete, revolutionary illusions, which are not in accord with ""broad"" constitutional activity. Broad constitutional activity consists in acting so as to fool the authorities; ""they"" will look for me among the Social-Democrats, or among the Socialist-Revolutionaries, but I shall hide in the Cadet list so well that they will not find me. The government will look for me as a revolutionary, but I shall fool both the government and the revolutionaries; I shall go over to the ""opposition bloc"". You see what a clever fellow I am!
But will it not turn out, Oh worthy politician, that you will be fooling also the masses, who will no longer be able to distinguish you from the ""opposition"" of the obsequious liberals?
Nonsense! What do the masses matter? . . . Well, we'll give the workers' curia a seat. . . . And then, from a certain point of view, we are all in favour of freedom . . . the revolution has become a national cause . . . the Cadets, too, are ready to fight in their own way. . . .
The question arises, have our Trudoviks any political ideas, besides ideas relating to the police ? They have. Their idea is that we must adapt ourselves not to the energetic and active voter, but to the stay-at-home, the cowed or sleepy voter. Listen to the arguments of a ""Left"" newspaper:
""The temper that prevails at meetings is no criterion of the temper of the whole mass of voters. . . . Not more than one-tenth of the voters go to meetings; of course, these are the most energetic, lively and active people.""
Truly a sufficient reason for trailing in the wake of the least energetic, the most lifeless and inactive Cadet voters! The tragedy of the Russian radical is that for decades he has been yearning for meetings, for liberty, burning with passion (in words) for liberty; and when he goes to a meeting and finds that its temper is more radical than his own, he begins to sigh: ""it is hard to judge"", ""not more than one-tenth"", ""one must be a bit more cautious, gentlemen!"" He is just like Turgenev's ardent hero who ran away from Asya, and about whom Chernyshevsky wrote ""A Russian at a Rendezvous"".
Oh, you, who call yourselves supporters of the toiling masses! It's not for you to go to a rendezvous with the revolution. Stay at home; really, it will be quieter there; and you need have no dealings with these dangerous ""most energetic, lively and active people"". Stay-at-home philistines are more your type!
Perhaps this simple example will help you to grasp the ""centre of the controversy"" over agreements with the Cadets?
It is, my dear sir, that we want to shake up the philistine and make a citizen of him. And to do that we must
compel him to choose between the philistine policy of the Cadets who are prostrating themselves before the (pshaw! pshaw!) ""constitution"", and the revolutionary policy of the socialist proletariat.
A ""bloc of all the Left parties"" means submerging the ""one tenth, the most energetic, lively and active people"", in the mass of the apathetic, stolid and somnolent. It means subordinating those who are willing to fight (and are capable of carrying the masses with them at the decisive moment) to those who prefer to play the same despicable game of loyalty that the Cadets played in the First Duma, and, like the Cadet Lvov, prefer to haggle with Stolypin and basely go over to the latter.
The reaction is attacking us, it has already withdrawn a good third of what was gained in October, and is threatening to withdraw the other two-thirds. But you pose as men of law and order and defend yourselves by appealing to philistine mentality: no attacks; no revolution; we are going into the Duma to legislate; we confine ourselves to defence ; we abide by the law!
When will you understand that to keep on the defensive is in itself an admission of moral defeat? In fact, you are people who have suffered moral defeat. All you are fit for is to vote for the Cadets.
""Compel the philistine to choose"", we said. Yes, compel. No socialist party in the world could wrest the masses from the influence of the liberal or radical bourgeois parties, which base themselves on the mentality of the philistine, without giving them a jolt, without meeting with some resistance, without taking the risk involved in the first experiment to decide who is really defending liberty, we or the
If there is an agreement with the Cadets, the philistine has no need to worry about this. The radical windbag politicians and Social-Democratic opportunists have already thought the matter out for him at their rendezvous with the Cadets. The philistine has shifted to the Left (not as a result of our efforts, not as a result of our Party propaganda, but as a result of Stolypin's zeal) -- that's enough for us. And since he has shifted to the Left, he will be for a ""bloc of all the Lefts""! And it will be the whole mass of philistines, not
merely the restive -- pardon -- active one-tenth of the people. We should adapt our meetings and our whole policy to suit the cowardly philistine -- that is what a bloc with the Cadets means in practice.
But we said: We need not only leaflets and platforms, resolutions and speeches, but we must carry out our whole policy, and election campaign in such a way as to draw a sharp contrast between the cowardly philistine and the staunch fighter. And this can be done only by contrasting two different lists: the Cadet list and the Social-Democratic list. In the metropolis, whose newspapers circulate all over Russia, where the headquarters of all the political parties are located, which leads the country ideologically and politically, it is a thousand times more important to give an example, not of a policy of philistine equanimity, but of a policy worthy of the October fighters who wrested a little freedom from the authorities, a policy worthy of the proletariat.
Our talk about the necessity of recognising the mistakes of the ""peace-loving"" Cadet Duma, and of taking a step forward, will remain idle talk unless we ourselves take a step forward in combating the philistine Oblomov idea of ""a bloc of all the Left parties"". Our calls to go forward will ring false and will fail to fire the hearts of the fighters among the people if we ourselves, the ""guides"", the ""leaders"", mark time in the capital in full view of all the peoples of Russia, arm in arm with these same Cadets, on the basis of an ""amicable "" distribution of seats, in friendly fashion, all together, all for the same cause, all for liberty. . . . What is the use of reviving old quarrels? What harm if the Menshevik Ivan Ivanovich did call the Cadet Ivan Nikiforovich a goose?
""Not more than one-tenth of the voters go to meetings.' . . . Very well, Mr. Radical. We will take your word for it for once; we will concede this point to you, because -- because your argument is so clumsy.
One-tenth of the voters makes 13,000 out of 130,000 for the whole of St. Petersburg. These 13,000, the most energetic, lively and active voters, are more to the Left than th Cadets. Let us ask ourselves: Can anyone of sound mind and judgement assert that the energetic people who attend meetings do not lead a certain number of the less energetic, stay-at-home voters? Everyone will realise that such an assertion
would be wrong ; that in a city with a population of a million and a half there are thousands of agencies and channels, apart from newspapers and meetings, through which the mood of the advanced elements is communicated to the masses. Everyone will understand -- and all elections in all countries confirm it -- that every energetic voter who attends meetings is backed by not one but several stay-at-home voters.
At the last elections, of the total of 150,000 voters in St. Petersburg, 60,000 went to the poll. Of these, about 40,000 voted for the Cadets, and about 20,000 in the whole of St. Petersburg voted for the Rights. We have heard from our Mr. Radical himself, who does not wish to be an ""optimist"" (Heaven forbid! our radicals want to be ""steady respectable people"" . . . like the German radicals of the eighteen forties). . . . We have heard from him that the Octobrists have become quiescent, and we know from facts of their utter defeat. Now we hear of 13,000 energetic voters who are more to the Left than the Cadets. Remember that this proportion varies considerably in the different districts. Remember the number of votes that are usually behind every voter who goes to meetings.
It will be clear to you then that the danger of a Black Hundred vote in St. Petersburg, meaning the danger of the Rights being elected to the Duma as a result of a split in the Cadet and socialist vote, is a preposterous fable. For the Rights to be elected to the Duma in St. Petersburg, the votes in the majority of the districts would not merely have to be split, but split in such a way that both the Cadets and the socialists would each have fewer votes than the Black-Hundred list. That is an obvious absurdity.
Therefore, we say plainly: if the Black-Hundred danger does not manifest itself in violations of the ""constitution"" (and it is the estimate of this prospect that is the crux of the difference between the tactics of the Cadets and that of the socialists), then a split in the Cadet and socialist vote cannot possibly result in a victory for the Rights in St. Petersburg.
The cry about the danger of a Black-Hundred victory in the elections in St. Petersburg is a deception of the people spread by the Cadets, the ""radicals' and the opportunists
of every brand, and serves the interests of philistinism in politics. In practice, the fable about this Black-Hundred danger is in the interests of the Cadets, whom it helps to protect against the danger from the Left. It serves to dull the senses of the masses, for it does not require them, when they cast their vote, to distinguish between the ""legislating"" bourgeois Cadet and the socialist who is leading the people into battle.
Therefore, when the general chorus of liberals, Trudoviks and opportunist Social-Democrats howl at us: You are isolated! -- we answer calmly: We are very glad to have isolated ourselves from a fraud. We are very glad to have isolated ourselves from a dirty business. For to come before a mass of 130,000 voters in St. Petersburg, after January 9, 1905, and after October 1905, in order to help to elect Kutler, Nabokov, Struve & Co. to the Duma is certainly a dirty business.
We predict to the Trudoviks and to the opportunist Social-Democrats who are rejoicing in anticipation that the Cadets will get them and not the Bolsheviks into the Duma -- we predict that if the Second Duma is a Cadet Duma, the Trudoviks and opportunist Social-Democrats will be ashamed of having helped to elect the Cadets. They will now be directly responsible for it. And the Cadets in the Second Duma will move so far to the right (this is evident from their general behaviour and from all the political literature they have issued during the past year) that even the extreme opportunists will be obliged to expose them. In the First Duma, the Cadet Lvov went over to the Peaceful Renovators and justified the Black-Hundred dissolution of the Duma. In the Second Duma (unless history brings us a radical change that
will wipe out all petty deals with the Cadets, and all the Cadets themselves), in the Second Duma the Cadets of the Lvov type will show their true colours not at the end, but at the beginning.
Well then, gentlemen, take the seats in the Duma that the Cadets are offering you! We do not envy you. We shall undertake to warn the mass of the workers and of the petty bourgeoisie in the capital. We shall undertake to make them realise -- not only by speeches, but also by means of the elections themselves -- the gulf that divides the Cadets from the socialists.
Every man to his trade -- though ""there are hosts of people who would like to mix these two trades, we are not of their number.""
""And they,"" says the leading article in Rodnaya Zemlya, speaking of the Bolsheviks, ""will now be even more isolated than ever; for those former boycottists, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, are now not only taking part in the elections, but are even in favour of a bloc with the Cadets.""
This is new and interesting. We have already observed, on a former occasion, that on this question of electoral agreements the Socialist-Revolutionaries are not behaving like a political party, but like an intellectualist clique, for we heard of no open political action of their organisations on this question. And now, assuming that the newspaper for which Mr. Tan writes is not telling a down right lie and is not repeating an unverified rumour, we shall draw this further conclusion -- namely: in the matter of electoral agreements the Socialist-Revolutionaries are guilty of political dishonesty, or, at any rate, are displaying vacillation that amounts to a political danger.
Everyone knows that the Conference of the St. Petersburg Social-Democratic organisation rejected a bloc with the Cadets and offered to enter into an electoral agreement with the Trudoviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries against the Cadets. Our resolution was published in all the newspapers.
Negotiations between the St. Petersburg Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and the appropriate bodies of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Committee of the Trudovik Group have already taken place. Differences arose over our exclusion of the Popular Socialists and over the distribution of seats. If, nevertheless, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who began negotiations with us after we had declared that we had definitely decided to give battle to the Cadets in St. Petersburg, have begun, or are continuing, negotiations with the Cadets for a bloc, then obviously, the Socialist-Revolutionaries are guilty of political dishonesty.
We openly declare: We are going to fight the Cadets. Who is on our side?
But the Socialist-Revolutionaries are negotiating both with us and with the Cadets!
We repeat: We do not know whether the leading article in Rodnaya Zemlya told the truth or not. We cannot altogether ignore a direct statement made by an organ to which Mr. Tan, a member of the Organising Committee of the Popular Socialist Party, is a contributor. We have learned about the bloc between the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Popular Socialists from the press and from the communications made by the Socialist-Revolutionaries in their negotiations with us (although we are ignorant of the terms of this bloc and of its real nature; in this connection also something is going on behind the scenes).
Our duty, therefore, is to raise this question publicly and openly, so that all may know of the behaviour of a certain political party. Hitherto, in this country, the alignment of parties has been determined only by their programmes and literature -- but these, after all, are only words. The First Duma provided an opportunity of judging some parties by their actions. Now we must make use of the elections, too, and we shall use them for fully enlightening the masses as to the real nature of the parties.
That the Socialist-Revolutionaries are hiding something in their relations with the Popular Socialists is now a political fact. That the Socialist-Revolutionaries are now actually trailing in the wake of the opportunist party that has split off from them is also a fact. Hence, in regard to revolutionary independence and determination the Socialist-Revolutionaries are really much worse than they seem to be. And if they agree to enter into a bloc with the Cadets -- and to gain a seat not for themselves, but for the Popular Socialists -- we shall have excellent agitational material with which to explain to the workers of St. Petersburg the Marxist thesis of the utter instability and deceptive exterior of the petty-bourgeois (even if revolutionary) parties.
We not only think that it is a matter of honour for a Social-Democrat to ""isolate"" himself from such parties, but we think it is the only well-calculated policy to pursue. But our calculation is made not from the point of view of seats in the Duma, but from the point of view of the working class movement as a whole, from the point of view of the fundamental interests of socialism.
But let us return to Rodnaya Zemlya. The following passage shows how frivolous that newspaper can be.
""Generally speaking, the decisions of the Bolshevik Conference appear to have been adopted hastily and rashly. After all in that respect are the Trudoviks better than the Popular Socialists?""
This ""after all"" is a real gem. The author is such an ignoramus in politics that he does not even realise that he is walking about naked, like an Australian savage. And these are the educated politicians of the petty bourgeoisie!
Well, there is nothing for it but to perform the ""thankless task"" of the publicist: to go over old ground and teach the ABC.
The Trudoviks, i.e., the Committee of the Trudovik Group, which was approached by the St. Petersburg Social-Democratic Conference, and the Popular Socialists, originated from the Trudovik Group in the First Duma. This Trudovik Group had two wings: one opportunist, the other revolutionary. The difference between them was most clearly revealed in the two Land Bills introduced by the Trudovik Group: the Bill of the 104, and the Bill of the 33.
Common to both Bills is that (1) they are in favour of transferring the land from the landlords to the peasants; (2) they are thoroughly permeated with the spirit of petty-bourgeois utopianism, the utopia of ""equalising"" small proprietors (in some respects, at least) in a society based on commodity production.
The difference between these Bills is that the first is permeated with the small proprietor's fear of being too radical, of drawing too large a mass of poor people into the movement. This ""spirit"" of the Bill of the 104 was admirably expressed by one of its authors, one of the leaders of the Popular Socialists, Mr. Peshekhonov, in referring to the declaration of the ""thrifty muzhiks"" in the Duma: ""We were sent here to get land, not to give it up."" This means that in addition to the utopia of petty-bourgeois equalitarianism this wing of the Trudoviks clearly expresses the selfish interests of the more well-to-do section of the peasantry, who are afraid lest they might have to ""give up"" something (on the assumption that there will be general ""equalisation"", as socialism is conceived by the petty bourgeois). Take from the
landlord, but give nothing to the proletarian, such is the motto of the party of the thrifty muzhiks.
On the other hand, the Bill of the 33 proposes the immediate and complete abolition of private property in land. It also contains the ""equalitarian"" utopia, and to the same degree, but it does not express the fear of having to ""give up"". This is the utopia, not of the opportunist but of the revolutionary petty bourgeois; not of the thrifty muzhik, but of the ruined muzhik. It is not a dream of profiting from the landlord to the detriment of the proletarian, it is a dream of making everybody, including the proletarians, happy by equalisation. It expresses, not the fear of drawing the broadest and poorest masses into the movement, but the desire to draw them into the struggle (the desire is there, but the ability or understanding how to do so is lacking).[*]
After the Duma this difference in the two trends among the Trudoviks led to the formation of two distinct political organisations: the Committee of the Trudovik Group, and the Popular Socialist Party. The former has earned an honour able place in the history of the Russian revolution by its July manifestoes. So far as public knowledge goes, it has not yet forfeited its good reputation, has never renounced its manifestoes or joined the chorus of moaners, grousers and renegades.
The second organisation took advantage of the period of the dissolution of the Duma to legalise itself under the Stolypin regime, to ""berate"" the above-mentioned manifestoes in the legal press, where it was shielded from criticism from the Left, to advise the people ""for the time being"" not to come into conflict with certain institutions of the old regime, and so forth. The Conference of the St. Petersburg Social-Democratic organisation was, if anything, rather mild in its criticism of this party when it spoke of its ""evasive position on the fundamental questions of the struggle outside the Duma"".
Thus, the political facts so far are that the petty-bourgeois or Trudovik parties have clearly split into the parties of
the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie (the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Committee of the Trudovik Group) and a party of the opportunist petty bourgeoisie (the Popular Socialists). Since for Social-Democrats the election campaign is a means for politically educating the masses, here too, by distinguishing two Trudovik parties from a third, we have compelled the ordinary man in the street to ponder over the reasons for this distinction. And after thinking it out and realising what it is all about he will make an intelligent choice.
In conclusion we must note that the naïve and ignorant leader-writer of Rodnaya Zemlya indulges also in amusing sophistries to support his case. It would not be amiss to analyse one of these sophistries, which is of a kind that just suits philistines:
""The Bolsheviks are wrong even if there is no Black-Hundred danger. For, in that case, there is no need for a bloc with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Trudoviks, and the Socialist-Democratic Party could with great benefit to the purity of its class content come out in the elections quite independently.""
See what clever fellows we are, thinks this radical -- we can even judge of the purity of class content!
Yes, the modern newspaper hack ""can"" make judgements about anything, but he lacks knowledge and understanding. It is not true to say that the need to preserve the purity of a class position precludes all agreements. To think so is to reduce the ideas of Marxism to absurdity, to make a caricature of them. And it is equally untrue to say that there is no need for a bloc with the Socialist-Revolutionaries if there is no Black-Hundred danger.
Complete independence of the Social-Democratic Labour Party in the election campaign is the general rule. But every live, mass party must allow certain exceptions, but only within reasonable and strictly defined limits. In the epoch of the bourgeois revolution all Social-Democrats sanctioned political agreements with the revolutionary bourgeoisie, when they worked together in the Soviets of Workers', Peasants', Soldiers', Railwaymen's, etc., Deputies, and when they signed the famous manifesto of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies (December 1905) or the July manifestoes (July
1906). The leader-writer of Rodnaya Zemlya is evidently ignorant of the most generally known facts about the parts played by the various parties in the Russian revolution. The revolutionary Social-Democrats reject unprincipled agreements, they reject harmful and unnecessary agreements, but they would never think of tying their hands altogether and under all circumstances. That would be childish. The platform of the 14 delegates at the All-Russian Social-Democratic Conference is documentary proof of that.
To proceed. The ""necessity"" of an agreement with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Trudoviks in St. Petersburg arises from the Cadet danger. Had the author of the leading article in Rodnaya Zemlya been familiar with the subject which he undertook to discuss, he would have known that even among the Social-Democrats who support agreements with the Cadets there are highly influential bodies (the Bund, for example) which recognise the need for a bloc with the revolutionary bourgeoisie in case of a Cadet danger, when there is no Black-Hundred danger. In St. Petersburg, it would be possible not only to conduct an election campaign in the spirit of revolutionary and socialist education of the masses (we Social-Democrats will achieve this in any case), but to defeat the Cadets, if the Menshevik Social-Democrats did not betray us, and if all the revolutionary Trudoviks followed all the socialists. And Since we are conducting an election campaign, we have no right to miss any opportunity of achieving victory, as long as there is no violation of the principles of socialist tactics.
That the only important fight being waged in St. Petersburg is that between the Cadets and the Social-Democrats is proved by the election meetings (the same holds good for Moscow, and we may add that the results of all straw votes, such as that instituted by the newspaper Vek, or by the Shop Assistants' Union ""Unity and Strength"", have also confirmed this thesis).
That an agreement with the Cadets means the ideological and political hegemony of the Cadets over their allies is borne out by the whole political press and by the whole character of the negotiations. The Cadets dictate the terms. The Cadets publicly lay down the significance of the agreements (recall their comments on the Mensheviks and the Pop-
ular Socialists: ""the moderate socialist parties"", ""the opposition bloc""). The Cadets are asked to agree to an equal distribution of seats as a maximum concession.
It is equally beyond doubt that an agreement between the Social-Democrats and the revolutionary-democratic parties means the hegemony of the Social-Democrats over the petty bourgeoisie. The Social-Democratic press has given an open, clear and all-round exposition of all its views, whereas the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Committee of the Trudovik Group have made no independent statement whatever on the question of agreements. The keynote is set by the Social-Democrats. The modification of their socialist views, of their class standpoint, is quite out of the question. When it comes to distributing the seats no one will think of offering them the smaller share. Their campaign in the workers' curia is proceeding quite independently, and is proving their preponderance.
Under such circumstances it would be simply absurd to be afraid to lead our revolutionary petty-bourgeois allies into battle against the Cadets. Under such circumstances we could even draw the Popular Socialists with us if the occasion required it. The principles of our Party would not suffer from this in the least: the political line would remain the same and the struggle against the leading party of the liberal-bourgeois conciliators would be waged with no less vigour. No sensible person would say that we were following the Popular Socialists (in conceding to them, together with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Committee of the Trudovik Group, two seats out of six). On the contrary, it would be proof that the Social-Democrats were conducting a really independent campaign, and that we had deprived the Cadets of one of their appendages. Is it not obvious that if the semi-Cadets came on our list, their mobilisation against the Cadets would not merely not prejudice, but would, on the contrary, facilitate the task of fighting the latter?
The Conference of the St. Petersburg Social-Democratic organisation acted rightly in declaring openly and publicly its hostility towards the Popular Socialists. It was our duty to warn the revolutionary Trudoviks against such a pseudo-Trudovik party. If the revolutionary Trudoviks are
dependent on the Popular Socialist Party, which is formally an entirely independent party, let them say so publicly. It is most important for us to drag this fact into the light of day, to make them admit it, and to draw all the conclusions that follow from it in our agitation among the mass of the workers, among the whole people.
Whether we get Trudoviks of a better or worse quality as our allies in the fight against the Cadets in St. Petersburg, is a question that we shall decide in a purely practical way. We have formulated our principles. In any case we shall go into the fight independently. We have openly disclaimed responsibility for the least reliable Trudoviks and placed this responsibility on others.
Rira bien qui rira le dernier (he who laughs last laughs best).
Our forecast has been proved correct.
There will be three lists for the Duma elections in St. Petersburg: the Black-Hundred, the Cadet and the Social Democratic.

The Left Cadets on Tovarishch tried to ridicule the Bolsheviks when the latter declared, as early as November, that three main parties were contending against each other in St. Petersburg: the Black Hundreds, the Cadets, and the Social-Democrats.

The pamphlet ""When You Hear the Judgement of a Fool. . . ."" (From the Notes of a Social-Democratic Publicist) was printed in St. Petersburg in January 1907 by the Novaya Duma Publishers at the legal Bolshevik print-shop Dyelo. Soon after, the police confiscated almost every copy. In 1912 the tsarist government banned the pamphlet.

In its issue No. 5, January 9 (22), 1907, the newspaper published preliminary results of the voting by its readers: 765 persons voted for the Cadets and 407 for the Social-Democrats.

"Drug demand rises over surge in ‘walking pneumonia,’ flu
270 patients hospitalized for mycoplasma pneumonia during 4th week of November: KCDC
By Park Jun-heePublished : Dec. 6, 2023 - 15:00
South Korean drugmakers are in a rush to mass-produce antipyretics and antibiotics to keep pace with demand for medicines amid the rise in cases of mycoplasma pneumonia -- a bacterium that causes respiratory infections -- and flu viruses during the winter.
To avoid a medicine shortage, Daewon Pharmaceutical has started boosting the production of fever medicines and antibiotics, according to reports on Wednesday citing pharmaceutical industry insiders.
Hanmi Pharmaceutical, another leading drugmaker, is also preparing to produce more medicines such as fever reducers and sell them in large quantities to meet market demand.
Industry insiders believe the spike in respiratory illnesses created a surge in demand, as over-the-counter remedies can help patients recover from infections faster if started early on.
Mycoplasma pneumonia is a type of common bacterial infection that can spread through droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is also called “walking pneumonia” for being relatively mild and not necessarily requiring hospitalization or bed rest. Currently it is classified at level four, the lowest in the country’s four-tier infection classification system.
The pathogen can linger in the nose and throat without making a person ill, but can develop into pneumonia if it spreads to the lungs. Pneumonia is usually treated with antibiotics without first testing to find the cause.
Young children under the age of five can develop cold-like symptoms, such as vomiting, sore throat and sneezing. They are also more prone to severe cases that progress to pneumonia if their immune systems are weak or have never been exposed to the bacterium. Older kids and adults could report symptoms like headaches, fatigue or a worsening cough lasting for several weeks.
In line with growing concerns over the uptick in the pneumonia outbreak and the seasonal illness, Ildong Pharmaceutical said it is also mulling whether to increase the production of medications and expand its availability for coughing and sneezing populations.
Korea United Pharm. Inc., a local pharmaceuticals producer, said that the company’s antibiotic production has increased by some 20 percent since October. Its production of expectorants and antitussives, more commonly known as cough suppressants, rose by about 15 percent in the same period, driven by increased demand.
Medication sales have been strong for some companies. Dong-A Pharmaceutical’s profit for fever reducer medicine for children stood at 423 million won ($322,000), a threefold increase from 152 million won in August, reflecting the spread of the illness during the fall-winter period.
Meanwhile, a total of 270 patients were hospitalized for mycoplasma pneumonia infections during the fourth week of November, up 97 from the first week’s 173, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday.
The patient illness rate for those who showed influenza-like symptoms was 45.8 per 1000 outpatients Nov. 19-25, the KCDC added.
A wave of childhood pneumonia infections struck China in September, with the average number of child patients recorded between 1,600 and 1,800 in Beijing, the neighboring country’s capital city. The illness has recently been detected in Indonesia, France, the Netherlands and Denmark.

"It's true - waxing isn't just for girls anymore a€"" an increasing number of men are visiting waxing salons for hairless chests, backs, buttox and noses. Some are even going hairless from the neck down, known as Brozilians, Manzilians or male bikini waxes. Is manscaping for you?
You don't have to know right away. But that's a sign you should take a little risk. That's more manly than putting your head in the hairy sand. Add it to your bucket list. The women will flip.
Let's start with an easy one: the eyebrow wax. It has been for the ladies only, but this brow wax is now common for guys. Well-shaped and trimmed eyebrows can enhance your natural features and bone structure, and the waxed man brow is attractive to ladies.
Now for the nose hairs and ear fur. As men get older, they grow thicker and denser hair (if only this were also true up top). When it's coming out of your ears and nostrils, you might look like Bigfoot. Get your unwanted face hair into place with nostril or ear waxing, or resort to the tweezers and trimmers. Get a lasting, smooth look, try the wax off, wax on approach.
Know, this, though: don't try it on your beard area! This manly hair is usually too thick and coarse - the follicles are too close together. Don't try for the skinned cat look. You should probably instead keep to regular shaving or get pampered with a trip to the barber. Often, waxing salons for men perform the perfect shave.
Hair isn't just hair anymore. Now, the amount of fur and grooming are more important, according to the best waxers at chest wax west valley, ut.
Let's take a few steps downstairs for a few minutes. To find the hottest examples, you have to go to Hollywood. Leading men have grooming methods such as waxing the hip bones to appear slimmer while leaving ab hair to make musculature. For the most adoring looks from the ladies, the movie stars opt for the full-body wax.
If you haven't ever done a wax, do it. It's sexy and pretty painless. Becoming all smooth and hairless could just be that bucket list item that you go for again and again.",0.9603052735328674,499,0.8241957426071167

"We have a Samsung RS261MDBP refrigerator, which is a side-by-side, frost-free model, with the freezer on the left, and refrigerator on the right.
One day, I noticed a puddle of water on the floor under the freezer. Since it was on the side with the water/ice dispenser, my first thought was that it might be the dispenser leaking. But then I opened the freezer door and noticed a frozen stream of water coming from inside the freezer. The freezer was still plenty cold, so I doubted it could be something melting. I took out the bottom drawer of the freezer, and then noticed a solid sheet of ice at the bottom of the freezer. I removed all the ice, and the problem went away for about a day, but then two days later, it was back, and so was the ice sheet. I never actually witnessed the water actively dripping.
Okay, nothing to do but roll up my sleeves, move all the food out of the freezer into an ice chest, and figure out what fed that ice sheet.
A bit of an aside as to how (I think) a frost-free freezer works. About once a day, a heater coil turns on for 5 minutes to melt off any frost that may have accumulated on the freezer coils. That water drips down into a pan under the refrigerator, where a fan evaporates it into the air. If that defrosting was happening at 3 am, it would explain why I never witnessed any actual dripping.
PRO TIP: It might be tempting to not bother taking the back cover off as above, but doing so will really save time and aggravation. You can gently squeeze the tube to clear the ice clog, or if the thing is frozen solid, apply heat with a hair dryer. Pouring hot water from the other side and waiting for it to drain can take hours.
Most likely, the drain had been clogged with ice, more than the defroster could melt in 5 minutes. I melted and cleaned out every bit of ice that I could see, and made sure that when I poured a half cup of water into the drain, it freely flowed into the evaporation pan under the fridge. Success. I put everything back together, and it’s been working fine for a month, now.
But how did this situation come about in the first place? My theory is that the freezer door had been open for a LONG time in humid weather, as we were reorganizing the freezer. Possibly, that gave an excessive amount of frost a chance to accumulate, and block the defroster drain.",0.9717735648155212,540,2.0992836952209473
"The Dawn of the Artificial Kidney
Artificial kidneys may sound like something from a science fiction movie, but these ground-breaking new treatments are currently being designed and tested across the globe.
These scientific advances offer patients with kidney failure the hope of more prompt or less burdensome treatments in the future, but can they become a reality?
Today, patients with kidney failure have two main options: a kidney transplant or dialysis. Either treatment can replace some lost kidney function and prolong life, but each comes with drawbacks. People opting for a transplant may face long waiting times due to donor organ shortages and will need lifelong treatment to dampen their immune system (known as immunosuppression).
Those receiving dialysis can begin treatment more promptly. However, they often feel tied down by the demands of regular dialysis sessions and restrictions on food and drink.
Meet the innovative dialysis and transplant technologies being developed for the future…
The wearable (or portable) artificial kidney
These backpack-sized dialysis devices could potentially allow a person to do blood-filtering dialysis (haemodialysis) any time and any place. This would mean more frequent removal of waste and fluid and the ability to do dialysis ‘on the go’ or away from home. This could improve people’s quality of life.
The devices will be quite lightweight (5–10 kg) and rely on long-lasting batteries, advances in miniaturisation (the art of making things tiny), and new filtering membranes.
Two of the best-known lightweight dialysis devices in development are:
- The Ambulatory Kidney to Improve Vitality (AKTIV), being developed at the University of Washington, USA.
- The Neokidney, being developed by the Dutch Kidney Foundation in partnership with several companies.
Both teams hope to start clinical testing on 2022–2023.
The bioartifical or ‘cyborg’ implantable kidney
A bioartificial kidney is being developed that consists of a blood filtration unit (called the haemofilter) and human kidney cells (called the bioreactor). The live cells could theoretically perform other important functions of a real kidney, such as releasing hormones to control blood pressure.
The idea is that the device would be implanted by surgery similar to a transplant operation. It would then stay in the body for many years. The cells used in the device would be grown from the patient’s own cells and kept in a special compartment away from the person’s bloodstream. This means the patient probably won’t need to take drugs to dampen their immune system (immunosuppressants), unlike a traditional transplant.
The best-known bioartificial kidney is being developed by The Kidney Project, at the University of California, San Francisco.
The team is in the process of testing the two components of the device. If the haemofilter works safely in animals, then clinical trials in humans could begin in or after 2022. Technical challenges include keeping the device working long-term.
Laboratory-grown living kidneys
Several researchers around the world are attempting to grow a complete human kidney using kidney cells from embryos, stem cells from adults or cloned tissue. Stem cells are early cells that usually lie dormant in the body. They can develop into many different cell types when needed. Cloned tissue is made by taking the DNA out of the cell you want to copy and putting it into a new cell, which multiplies.
A team from Manchester University is the first in the world to have grown the parts of the kidney that filter blood (nephrons) in a laboratory dish using human stem cells. The laboratory-grown nephrons were then implanted into a mouse. They were able to filter the animal’s blood and produce urine, similarly to how a normal kidney works.
With healthy kidneys having an estimated 1 million nephrons each, the process would need scaling up to grow whole organs ready for transplantation. The beauty of using a patient’s own stem cells is that this could help to avoid their body rejecting the laboratory-grown kidney (which can happen with today’s kidney transplants).
The ability to grow nephrons in the lab is an exciting development. However, this research is in the early days. A lot more work is needed before lab-grown whole kidneys become available to patients.

Lineage: Streptomyces bingchenggensis; Streptomyces; Streptomycetaceae; Actinomycetales; Actinobacteria; Bacteria
General Information: Streptomyces bingchenggensis BCW-1 was isolated from a soil sample collected in Harbin, China. This species produces milbemycins, a family of macrocyclic lactones widely used in human health, animal health, and crop protection. The characteristic earthy smell of freshly plowed soil is actually attributed to the aromatic terpenoid geosmin produced by species of Streptomyces. There are currently 364 known species of this genus, many of which are the most important industrial producers of antibiotics and other secondary metabolites of antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antitumor nature, as well as immunosuppressants, antihypercholesterolemics, etc. Streptomycetes are crucial in the soil environment because their diverse metabolism allows them to degrade the insoluble remains of other organisms, including recalcitrant compounds such as lignocelluloses and chitin. Streptomycetes produce both substrate and aerial mycelium. The latter shows characteristic modes of branching, and in the course of the streptomycete complex life cycle, these hyphae are partly transformed into chains of spores, which are often called conidia or arthrospores. An important feature in Streptomyces is the presence of type-I peptidoglycan in the cell walls that contains characteristic interpeptide glycine bridges. Another remarkable trait of streptomycetes is that they contain very large (~8 million base pairs which is about twice the size of most bacterial genomes) linear chromosomes with distinct telomeres. These rearrangements consist of the deletion of several hundred kilobases, often associated with the amplification of an adjacent sequence, and lead to metabolic diversity within the Streptomyces group. Sequencing of several strains of Streptomyces is aimed partly on understanding the mechanisms involved in these diversification processes.",0.9195102453231812,468,2.7380754947662354

"I’m leading a field trip to a beech-sugar maple forest this spring. We’ll look at the spring flowers and as we stroll around also talk about what mesophytic forests are like, why they are where they are, what the interactions among the organisms are, and other such natural history and ecology topics.
The specific site where we’ll gather is the Mildred Harris Sanctuary north of Kalamazoo. It’s owned by the Michigan Audubon Society and has been stewarded for many years by the Audubon Society of Kalamazoo.
The trip is sponsored by the Southwest Chapter of the Michigan Botanical Club as part of its 2012 project concentrating on natural features and conservation in Oshstemo Township (known to some as the Occupy Oshtemo movement.
I’ve led a trip along these lines several springs in past years, to one or another of the remaining examples of mesophytic forest in southwest Michigan. But there’s a difference this year.
Most such trips for spring ephemerals led by me or others have been held in mid or late April or even early May. This year the president, Tyler Bassett, of the Southwest Chapter of the Botanical Club and I had agreed on Saturday April 21 as the date. Then the second week of March arrived. The beginning of March had temperatures fairly close to the historical averages–30s as highs and 20s as lows. March 6 started a run in which day after day had highs at least in the 60s and often the 70s. March 19 to 22, had a run of highs in the 80s. The last freezing temperatures came far back in February.
Looking at what was happening to the flora, Tyler and I decided to move the date of spring wild flower trip up by two weeks, to Saturday March 7.
One swallow doesn’t make a summer, but seventeen days with temperatures between 60 and 85 in the middle of March may make it necessary for Michigan nature organizations to revise their field trip calendars.
Here’s an idea, a sampling, of what’s been happening this spring: As mentioned in my last post, I heard wood frogs in Oshtemo Township 12 March and by the next night, they were joined by a few spring peepers.
By the night of 15 March, both these species as well as chorus frogs were in full voice. On the 15th, the high temperature was 79 and the low 55, compared with historical averages of 45 and 27 degrees.
As to the plants, on a visit 14 March to Newton Woods at Russ Forest, two friends and I found spring beauty up, a broad-leaved sedge with flowering stalks, and harbinger of spring close to full bloom.
In Oshtemo Township, spice bush was in full bloom by 18 March, a golden haze over the edges of the kettles where the frogs had gathered. Bloodroot was in bloom 19 March.
On 22 March, I visited a rich beech-maple forest in Pavilion Township. All of the following (in the order I came across them) were in bloom:
Spring beauty, Dutchman’s breeches, Yellow violet, harbinger of spring (nearly done), blue violet, Carex plantaginifolia (nearly done), toothwort, purple spring cress, wood anemone, and skunk cabbage.
Several other species were up and some had obvious flower buds.
So we’ll gather this year April 7 at the Harris Sanctuary which is in the southwest corner of F Avenue and 8th Street. It’s about 3 miles north of the trail-head of the Kal-Haven Trail (which is on 9th Street). F Avenue is a gravel road–a Natural Beauty road, in fact. Attendees should park on the north side of the road. Be there by 10 AM.
Harris is on the Kalamazoo moraine, so there will some mild hill climbing. We’ll finish about noon. Bring a sandwich and have lunch sitting on a log if you wish.
The technically minded may notice that the Harris Sanctuary is not in Oshtemo Township. But it’s pretty close.

"Backyard Waterfalls in Upper Brookville, NY 11545
Can Small Backyard Ponds and Waterfalls Increase Your Upper Brookville, NY Home’s Value?
Backyard waterfalls in Upper Brookville, NY are beautiful, so it’s not surprising that many people want to build a pond or a smaller waterfall in their yard. They can provide many health and environmental benefits, from bringing you relaxation to purifying the air to inviting wildlife into your yard. However, can small backyard ponds and waterfalls in Upper Brookville, NY increase your home’s value?
While you may want a small pond or a water feature, it’s no surprise that it’s expensive to create a pond or outdoor waterfall. And when you spend that much money on your backyard, it’s tempting to hope you can get some of that investment back when you sell your house.
There are many factors that can come into play when answering this question, and Scott Anderson Design will discuss them below. If you’re interested in adding a water garden to your backyard, you must read this blog post first. Call Scott Anderson Design if you want to build a pond and create the perfect backyard that may increase your home’s value.
Many Types of Water Features
First, you may wonder what types of water features are available for your Nassau County backyard. One type of feature is a small pond. Nothing is more beautiful than a pond, especially if you fill the pond with koi fish. You can sit outside, run your hand along with the flat stone on the edges of the pond, and breathe in the scent of nature.
There are also backyard waterfalls that you can add to your Upper Brookville, NY yard. These larger structures are perfect for listening to the calming sound of water trickling into some shallow water.
You can also have a fountain installed in your backyard. However, no matter what you choose, you need to choose a professional, like Scott Anderson Design.
Positives and Negatives
Water features for your Nassau County yard look beautiful, but can they increase your home’s value? There are some positives and negatives of owning backyard waterfalls that can affect your home’s value. Before installing a small pond or waterfall, consider these pros and cons.
They Increase Your Curb Appeal
One of the best pros of water features is they can increase your curb appeal. Many homeowners desire the perfect curb appeal, and a pond with modern flexible liners and perfectly laid stones can do just that.
Many people desire to have a Zen place in their home they can go to and relax. When you include a garden pond in your backyard, you create that serene place. Plenty of homeowners searches for homes with plenty of curb appeal.
It Blocks Noise Pollution
Plus, waterfalls can block noise pollution. If you live somewhere near traffic, this is a great asset and can increase your home’s value. Listen to the water moving and close your eyes. Suddenly, you’ll find yourself transported out of Nassau County and into nature. Who doesn’t want a little break from the city?
However, there are a few cons. One of which is the price. Landscaping of any kind can cost a lot of money, and ponds and waterfalls are no different. If you don’t have a lot of money lying around, don’t build a pond just to increase your home’s value. What homeowners in Upper Brookville, NY want will always change, so you never know if small backyard ponds and waterfalls will increase your house’s value or not.
They Require Upkeep
Many homeowners may not want your home with a water feature because they require plenty of maintenance and upkeep. Some people may not want to put in the time, effort, and money to keep the fountain or pond looking beautiful, so you may lose potential homebuyers.
Can Small Backyard Ponds and Waterfalls Increase Home Value?
So can small backyard ponds and waterfalls in Nassau County increase your home’s value? There is no definitive answer to that question. Many homebuyers seek the beauty and curb appeal that backyard waterfalls bring. However, others don’t want to deal with the upkeep.
If you’ve considered building a pond or waterfall, you should do so because you want it, not because it may increase your home’s value. If you want to learn more about the benefits of water features, call Scott Anderson Design at 516-729-5668 today.
Some information about Upper Brookville, NY
Upper Brookville is a village located within the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 1,698 at the 2010 census.
The village is named for the brook that once ran along its main road, Wolver Hollow. Although the village is physically lower than the surrounding areas, resident Hope Goddard Iselin opposed the name of Lower Brookville, stating ‘I refuse to live in lower anything. If you must call it something, and I suppose you must, call it Upper Brookville.’ Subsequently, Upper Brookville was the name that stuck.
Upper Brookville incorporated as a village in 1932.

"“Epic Salutations,” the seductive opening track on Murs’ new album Love and Rockets, Vol. 1: The Transformation ends with what sounds like a mission statement: “Hard core rap about nothing at all.” But the reality of this fine hip-hop record is far more complex. While Murs still wants to liberate his favorite subgenre from the streets, he also wants to give those heavily stereotyped origins their due.
One of the album’s catchiest tracks “Easy-E” is a tribute not only to the NWA legend, but to a long list of those who developed the hard core sensibility. Or at least those progenitors from west of the Rocky Mountains. The song revives memories of the East Coast versus West Coast conflict of the 1990s that started out largely as a way to move units and ended up costing the lives of both Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. Yet because Murs heaps praise on his forebears from California without dissing anyone on the other shore, the famous feud is reduced to the level of the “scrapping in the parking lot at Target” he mentions in the song.
Finding humor and hope in a legacy of needless bloodshed isn’t easy. But “Easy-E” manages to do just that. Even as he acknowledges the problems with a culture that exalted violence, Murs allows us to perceive the discrepancy between the death-dealing content of gangsta rap and the way it inspired young people like him to do something with their lives.
Although the meaning of the song’s chorus is ambigious, the feelings it communicates are emphatically positive: “When Easy-E was playing on the radio/I knew exactly how my day would go/California sunshine coming in/Singing gangsta rap with all my friends.” The song’s name-checking of artists associated with “the origins of California hip-hop” isn’t just an exercise in paying dues; it’s a way to retell a rich history but tell it slant.
The rest of the album builds on this project in various ways, repurposing the groove and swagger of gangsta rap at its best for a world that cries out for other ways of addressing one’s grievances. No, this isn’t “conscious” hip-hop in the politically engaged sense of Public Enemy, Mos Def or The Coup. The impact it makes is more subtle. For some critics it was clearly too subtle. Sometimes, though, indirection is the best form of direct action. Listeners who close their ears to preaching can still be converted to a new way of thinking.
The title of Love and Rockets, Vol. 1: The Transformation was not chosen lightly. Despite being consistently entertaining — moving effortlessly from wry to laugh-out-loud hilarious, coolly observant to stingingly heartfelt — Murs’ raps are all working towards the goal of liberating the social energy locked inside the music that he grew up singing with his friends. That’s why his choice of sounds is so significant.
Together with rising-star producer Ski Beatz, Murs redeems some of the least-lauded sounds in soul. Most of the album’s musical beds are constructed from sugary 80s “synth” numbers, light years removed from the Motown and Stax Records tracks that were the mainstay of first-generation rap. But the interplay between this outwardly suspect foundation and Murs’ masterful flow finds barbs within the syrup. The effect is to turn the clichÃ©s of gangsta rap inside out, slyly reminding listeners in the process that “hard core” legends like Dr. Dre got their start in the music business wearing the satiny suits of respectable black pop in the Reagan Era.
Although Love and Rockets, Vol. 1: The Transformation is too diffuse to be classified as a true concept album, there’s no mistaking the trajectory Murs charts from the opening track to its unexpectedly chilling conclusion. The last song “Animal Style” starts out with the promise of love, telling the story of two gay brothas who manage to find each other despite the intense social pressure in their community against homosexuality.
As the story of Jonathan, who is reasonably comfortable being “out,” and the closeted, gang-banging Roderick unfolds, the price of bliss becomes painfully clear. When Jonathan forgets himself and kisses his lover in public, their hope for a life together after high school turns into something dark and hateful: “Roderick dissed him/Threw him to the floor/He said, ‘You faggot/What’d you have to go and do that for?’”
Things only get worse from there. For an album that has been trying so hard to promote transformation, this sobering finale is major reality check. Some might say that Murs should have sequenced the tracks differently, so that listeners would exit on a more optimistic note. But this is where the homage paid on “Easy-E” gets returned with interest. By reappropriating the gangsta rap “ballad” — that antithesis to the boasting and bragging that otherwise define the subgenre — for a subject that its virulently homophobic discourse would never have countenanced, Murs performs the most impressive transformation of all.
There has been a lot of fine hip-hop released this past year. From platinum-selling Kanye West’s deservedly praised My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy to the proudly eccentric Danny Brown’s richly rewarding XXX, the American front has produced impressive work. And the genre’s global manifestations continue to mutate in fascinating ways, as U.K. rapper Ghostpoet’s dubstep-colored Peanut Butter Blues & Melancholy Jam forcefully demonstrates. But no one has done a better job of confronting hip-hop as a historical phenomenon than Murs. Where others perceive only the burden of a troubled ancestry, blocking the passage to a better future, he finds a way to turn that mass into light.",0.9482578635215759,1298,1.1781055927276611

"Impact Health and Social Care Services on the Nation’s Health
Instructions: This section of a report is about UK mental health services, so please use only UK policies such as Mental Health Act and Community Care Act, NOT international policies.
Please do not include introduction and conclusion as this is the middle part of the report.
2.1 Evaluate the impact of the current Health and Social Care services on the Nation’s Health
2.2 Identify key government policies and analyse the effects they have on health and social care provision.
3. Understand the organization of local Health and Social Care services
3.1 Evaluate the relationship between structures delivering primary and secondary health care
• Health and Social Care Services and the Nation’s Mental Health (300 words) (2.1) In this section you need to evaluate service provision by exploring the numbers of people with a mental illness diagnosis, and explain whether the evidence suggests that they are well cared for or not.
• Government Policies and Social Care Provision (300 words) (2.2) In this section you need to identify government policies and analyse their effect on service provision. E.g. how does the policy of moving people into community care effect the service a person can have. ( 2 policies Mental Health act and Community care act; and can include case studies of mentally ill patients eg. Christopher Clunis – Schizophrenic patient stabbed Jonathan Zito 1992. )
• The Relationship between Primary and Secondary Mental Health Care (300 words) (3.1) In this section you need to evaluate local (Medway and Kent area in UK) primary and secondary services, and evaluate how well they work together to provide care.
Impact Health and Social Care Services on the Nation’s Health
Mental health patients receive care facilitation in a number of ways, through Health and Social care services. There are 57 mental health trusts and 86 independent mental health hospitals that are registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC, 2015). The CQC further indicates that as of 31st March 2015, there were 19,656 detained inpatients. Apart from inpatients, there are also outpatients. Detention of inpatients is guided by the Mental Health Act, whereby it was used more than 58,000 times in the year 2014/15. The Care Quality Commission report provides insight into service provided to mental illness patients, although it mainly focuses on adherence to the Mental Health Act. Based on the evidence presented in the report, it would appear that patients with mental illness diagnosis are generally well cared for. For instance, the CQC points out that it had found numerous examples of improvements on services, citing an instance where patients had been provided with a Wi-Fi connection. They also found evidence of support and protection of patient’s rights, all astute indicators of the good quality of care.
While in general, there is proper care for patients, there are still many areas of concern in the provision of service. One problem area that has been pointed out is medication and treatment practices. The CQC reports that capacity assessment for medication during patient admission was lacking in 32% of the total cases assessed. Another area is in the facilitation of support to patients to enhance their involvement in their care. The type of facilitation envisioned here includes the type of information patients receive, and external support (CQC, 2015). This lack of facilitation has a detrimental effect since it could hamper patient recovery. Other effects include lengthened stays in the hospital as well as poor discharge, and an elevated risk of readmission.
Key Government Policies
The UK government has been active in developing policies regarding health and social care provision. In particular, the policies regarding social care in the UK appear to target the setting up of an interagency inter-professional workforce (Tope & Thomas, 2007). Apart from government policies, there are a number of laws governing the provision of health services and care. An example of this is the National Health Services Act. Another more confined act in terms of its scope is the Mental Health Act 1983, which mainly targets health care and service provision to patients diagnosed with mental illness.
As part of its efforts to support the interagency and inter-professional framework, the government has introduced several initiatives. For example, several mechanisms were introduced into the National Health Service Act (1977) towards this end. Sections 28A and 28BB enabled the transfer of money between NHS and local authorities (Tope & Thomas, 2007). Furthermore, under section 31 of the Act, introduced in 1999, there are three new mechanisms which have the same aim. They include pooled budgets, integrated service provision, and lead commissioning. The effects of these mechanisms are to improve efficiency in service delivery, by reducing the barriers associated with collaborative working between these different agencies and staff in local authorities.
The Mental Health Act has had a profound impact on improving the quality of care that mentally ill patients receive. For instance, there was a 10% year over year increase from 2014 to 2015 in the number of people detained in accordance with the act (CQC, 2015). One of the most significant impacts of the Mental Health Act is that it has severely redacted the level of freedom patients, through provisions which restrict the rights of individuals.
The organization of local Health and Social Care services
Primary health care and secondary health care differ fundamentally in the nature of care received. Primary care is the first point of a contact with a health professional for a patient suffering from a particular illness. It is the gateway to receiving specialist care. A patient may be referred to a secondary care professional, in the event that the primary care provider perceives there is a need to do so. The secondary care provider usually possesses expertise in the issue facing the patient.
The Kent and Medway area has a large number of patients with mental illness, with 163000-190000 people suffering from common mental health problems. A majority of patients with mental health needs receive care from the primary care GPs. In the event that these patients require specialized care, then these GPs will refer the patients to secondary health care providers (White, 2013). In Medway, these referrals are made to the Medway Integrated Mental Health Service, which further accept referrals from other parties, including self-screen referrals. Medway has an elaborate referral system which sets out the various organs to which primary practitioners can make referrals. These organs include the Alcohol Services, eating Disorders Services and the Mental Health Services for Learning Disability. Each of these organs has its own set of eligibility criteria, which set out which patients qualify for referral to that particular entity.
alternate interplay in the movement of patients occurs during recovery. While
the norm is that patients move from primary care practitioners to secondary
care practitioners, as patients recover, they may move back to their GP. The
NHS in Medway and Kent area commits itself to supporting GP practices so that
they are able to take back the management of patients from secondary care
services (NHS, 2013). The various
frameworks set in place create a synergistic relationship that improves the
overall quality of care that patients receive.

"When you travel long enough and become a stranger to every land you step on, you stop having a journey, but the journey starts having you. A motorcycle passes by very close with a groovy sound and disturbs the balance of my bicycle. I see the rider with leather jacket, leather pants and leather everything. He seems as owned by the journey as I am, fixating to the horizon wondering what the Master Road will give or take. The unknown makes us slaves. On the road, no matter how hard you plan and prepare yourself there is always something that will give you the chills, shake you to your bones and make you question yourself about your abilities. I don’t remember how many times I gave up this trip after having a flat tire or falling down or it suddenly started to rain. I began the trip that many times, as a loyal slave of the unknown. Then, why do the people who are searching for the unknown behave like masters of the universe? I guess there is a difference between living the unknown with all its inconveniences and observing it in labs under controlled conditions. The road is fairly narrow and when a vehicle passes me by I can feel the heat of its engines. It is not a good feeling even when the weather is very cold and your body desperately wants to warm up. I see one car coming towards me. It is better when a car comes from behind and you don’t see and experience this closeness as much. It is strange to have moments when you prefer less control over more control because more control will give you dilated pupils and a pounding heart. Every once in a while the unknown covers your back and you like him a little. The car is approaching, I am pedaling. It is a yellow beetle. I like its color.",0.9751285910606384,363,1.1603854894638062

"I'm a newb, Started looking through the doc, but I could not find any repository for all the definition files.
I did find Six_Shooters doc on how to create a ADX, and he was working on a 7747. Just what I needed
Is there a place where everybody is sharing their files? or is everybody on their own?
You may find some adx's on the moates.net fileman site. Link is on the moates.net site, at the bottom of the left navigation bar. There's a username and password that need to be entered for access, instructions are on the link page.
$59 (www.code59.org) has a few adx's created for use with it. S_AUJP also has an adx or two created. Other's seem to be made by the person using them.
Glad that the tutorial has been of use. I spent some time figuring out how to do that and bugged a couple people for direction, so I was hoping in creating that tutorial it would help others get to the creation point quicker.
Thanks Six. Yeah it was very useful. I would recommend making it a sticky.
I do have a few Q's though,

"What Should You Do If An Old Dental Crown Falls Off?
Dental crowns can last for a very long time, but like all things, they can suffer damage and eventually start to degrade as a result. If you have a dental crown that's been with you for as long as you can remember and it's fallen off, then you need to take action to protect your teeth. Here's what you should be doing right now.
Make an Appointment ASAP
First things first: make an appointment with a dentist to have your crown replaced with a new one. This is essential. There is no particular fix to repairing a dental crown at home, and anything that you do to put it back on will only be a temporary measure. In the meantime, the tooth that was covered by the crown is now exposed to all the bacteria and potential trauma of chewing in your mouth, which means that it's more likely to suffer additional damage. If the tooth is allowed to be uncapped for long enough, it could even need a root canal, so you need to get an appointment as soon as possible.
Use Dental Adhesive
In the meantime, you can take steps to put your damaged crown back on and protect your tooth with it. This is also essential to ensuring that your tooth doesn't experience additional damage.
To do this, go to your local drugstore and head to the dental aisle. There you should be able to find a temporary dental adhesive that's designed for mounting crowns back on. Follow the directions on the product and use firm pressure to press the crown back over the tooth. This should help to keep the crown in place, but keep in mind that it's a temporary fix and that the crown may still pop off again before you get to the dentist's office. Be careful not to choke on it or accidentally swallow it if it does come off.
When you head to the dentist's office, they'll get started right away to protect your tooth. They'll remove the crown if you've temporarily mounted it again and will examine the tooth.
If the tooth has been damaged or the filling within it has been damaged, your dentist will take steps to repair the damage and to ensure that your tooth stays healthy. This may involve removing the old filling and placing a new one, or putting filling in new areas that have been freshly damaged since the crown fell off.
From there, they'll put a temporary crown over your tooth. A new, permanent one will be ordered that will fit your tooth more appropriately and will match the color and shape of your tooth so that no one notices that you have a crown. It should be ready within days, so you'll head back to the dentist to repeat this process when it is. Contact someone like Gregory S Rutherford, DDS to schedule a consultation.",0.9708566069602966,570,1.7651166915893555

"Anna’ Stampin’ Cave – Customers Thank You Cards Using Beautiful Healing Hugs Stamp Set
Today I’ve got for you really beautiful Thank You cards I’ve made using Healing Hugs Stamp Set by Stampin’ Up!
These were the cards for my customers who shopped with me in the month of June and used Host Code. I have sent them out with rhinestones and some treats!
I had a little delay this month because of MS giving me hard time again, but my ladies were very understanding and loved their parcels. I even received a couple of messages back to say how much they loved them!
Healing Hugs ‘thank you’ cards
For my cards I’ve used a gorgeous distINKtive stamp set called Healing Hugs and a sentiment from Love What You Do stamp set.
Healing Hugs Thank You Cards dimensions:
- Poppy Parade/Gorgeous Grunge/Bermuda Bay cardstock: 11-6/8″ x 4-1/8″ scored at 5-1/2″ (29.7 x 10.5 cm scored at 13.9 cm)
- Whisper White cardstock: 4″ x 5-1/2″ (10.3 cm x 13.9 cm)
- Whisper White cardstock for inside: 4-1/8″ x 4″ (10.5 cm x 10.3 cm)
- Whisper White cardstock for the sentiments
- Mini Striped Ribbon in Poppy Parade/Gorgeous Grape/Bermuda Bay: approx. 4″ (10.3 cm)
I started by preparing the bases for three cards. Once I scored each card base at 5-1/2″, I had 6/8″ of cardstock hanging off the base. I trimmed it off and saved it, as I will need it later in the design.
Usually, I make individual cards, but for customers, I really like to make cards in batches. Once I have a design I choose colours, and then I start making the cards, each step at a time.
For these cards, I chose to use three different colours: returning Poppy Parade, new Gorgeous Grape and current Bermuda Bay (the bases and stamping). To help me with accurate stamps placings I have used a Stamparatus.
Colour Choices, stamping & masking
My first colour choice was Poppy Parade for the base and flowers, followed by Gorgeous Grape and Bermuda Bay. For leaves and background accents I’ve used accordingly either Soft Sea Foam and Granny Apple Green.
I stamped the main flower first on each Whisper White panel and next onto some masking paper and fussy cut it.
I placed the mask over the flower and stamped two more flowers, one above and one below, first stamping them off for a lighter shade.
Next, using the same mask I stamped the leaves. For the Gorgeous Grape card, I’ve used Granny Apple Green for the leaves. On other cards, the foliage was stamped in Soft Sea Foam.
Once all the flowers and leaves on all of the cards were stamped I decided to use small ‘plus’ stamp from the same stamp set to add some detail to the background.
I didn’t use a Stampratus for this, just a regular acrylic block, size ‘D’. Added details as I went along using same greens as before.
Before I mount all the panels to the card bases I distressed the edges using paper snips and adhered them either centred or to the right.
Finishing off the cards
I took the 6/8″ pieces of cardstock that I have trimmed from bases earlier and stamped them using the flower stamp and Versamark ink pad, to create a subtle background. I adhered them to the cards using snail adhesive.
I have added those strips to my cards and also adhered around 3-1/2″ length of Mini Striped ribbons to each (according to the colour of the base).
For the sentiment, I have used the ‘Thank You’ stamp from Love What You Do stamp set. I stamped it on a strip of Whisper White cardstock, in Memento Black, using Stamparatus.
I trimmed each sentiment to measure 1″ x 2-1/2″ and pop them up on the cards using dimensionals.
Inside the cards, I stamped the flowers and leaves in Versamark for tone on tone look. Next, I adhered smaller Whisper White panels inside those cards.
And here’s the last peak on all colours/designs together –
I truly hope you like my cards and enjoyed coming to my blog today.
As always, if you wish to purchase any of the products I have used, simply click the images below to go directly to my online store.
Thank You Gifts will be shipped mid-August.

"[This post is the result of the Asexuality Questionnaire project. The quotations used within are gathered from anonymous responses to questions asked as part of that project.]
Coming out is an important part of the asexual experience. Most asexuals consider coming out at some point. Often, they’ll confide in a close friends, other times, they’ll dive in with a running leap and announce their orientation to the entire world. Some decide to remain in the closet until another time.
Many people are only out to a few of their friends or only part of their family. The phrase “I’m out to the people who matter” came up repeatedly in the responses. It seems to be uncommon for an asexual to be out to everyone they know. The two most common reasons for not coming out to a particular person are fear of how they’ll react and not considering it important that they know. Quite a few people just viewed their asexuality as a component of who they are, and held a “Yeah? So what?” view of it, that is, they don’t hide it, but they don’t feel a need to broadcast it to the world, and they’ll talk about it if it ever comes up.
When it comes to family, more people said that they were out to a sibling than to a parent, and more were out to parents than grandparents. Sometimes they would be out to only one parent, but not want to tell the other. Often, different members of the family would react differently. A brother might be wholly accepting, while the mother could be dismissive. Awkwardness discussing sexual matters (or lack thereof) with family and fear of rejection were some of the primary reasons for not coming out to family.
Most people who came out reported at least one positive experience. Positive or neutral experiences seemed to outnumber negative experiences. In fact, many of the people who responded did not report any reactions that they classified as negative.
Quite a few people stressed that coming out was a personal decision to make. No one should feel as though they have to come out. In the end, it’s nobody’s business but your own, so if you don’t want to tell anyone else, that’s perfectly fine.
Many reactions are positive.
“The first time I came out, it was to a bunch of my long-time online friends, and I had a very positive response. After that, it was my parents, who were mostly okay with it, and then my more liberal friends, and now it’s pretty much any time it comes up. Most of the responses have been indifferent or positive.”
“They were both incredibly accepting and awesome.”
“Yes, my parents especially were accepting of me. They had never put any pressure on me before, so their reaction was mostly, “So that’s why. That’s cool.” ”
“People have repeatedly supported me by reiterating the fact that I am who I am and it’s okay.”
“Most people accepted the information like they’d have accepted information about my favourite food: mostly they just said something like ‘Ah, okay’ or just continued the conversation like it wasn’t anything out of the ordinary.”
“I got high-fived once! That was pretty great.”
“I’ve been lucky. Everyone has been really great about it, once they knew what it was.”
“Almost everyone single person I have told has been very supportive and respectful, and the ones who weren’t didn’t care enough to stop talking to me.”
Some are not.
“My mother was furious. I explained what asexuality was, but she was adamant it didn’t exist. “There’s only heterosexuality and homosexuality!” she shouted. I didn’t make matters better when I confessed to being bi-romantic. After threatening to hit me, she stormed out of my room. (I should not that she did not hit me, only threatened to.) Later when my dad came upstairs to wish me goodnight I came out to him too. He didn’t care so much about the bi-romantic part. But when I told him I was asexual- I’ve never seen him look so disappointed. He wasn’t angry, just sad almost. Like I’d failed him. He told me that I was still young, and not to make such a big decision just yet. Both my parents act like that night never happened.”
“Denial was sharp and one of the worst pains.”
“I have only come out to my husband, who immediately regarded it as a failure of his sexual skills.”
“My one friend made bacteria jokes and told me I was broken.”
“I’ve been prayed over. I’ve had a therapist fixate on my asexuality to the point of ignoring everything else, claiming to accept me but going on about it in session after session. I’ve lost someone who was, at that time, my best friend; he just drifted away from me, and that was the start. I’ve been told, repeatedly, that I was broken, damaged, ugly. My mom once, after accepting me for a long time, suggested that I should get my hormones checked. I’ve had doctors treat it as a symptom, or with suspicion. I have one friend who, no matter how many times I tell, never seems to absorb the information.”
“My cousin said some very hurtful things to me and I was very depressed, even suicidal for a while. I had to cut him out of my life. If people can’t accept you for who you are, then they don’t deserve your time of day.”
“I lost one friend when I discovered he harasses asexuals on Tumblr for “appropriating queerness.” We were friends before I realised I was asexual and he realised there was such a thing. We both discovered the community separately, and apparently both had very different reactions to it.”
“First boyfriend tried to fix me with his magical penis. I’m not sure how much worse than that you can get.”
Several people “tested the waters” beforehand, talking about asexuality with people before coming out to them.
“I have not come out to my parents. I’ve told them both *about* asexuality and their reactions were not promising. I think my dad would make a lot of well-meaning but annoying conjectures about where it came from, and my mom would flip out and tell me I had an illness and if I didn’t get treated I would be “missing a crucial part of life”.”
Some people are out because they didn’t feel right concealing it.
“I came out because I didn’t want to keep such an important secret from my friends, especially when it’s directly relevant to my identity and relationships.”
“I do like telling people the truth and not having their expectations shattered after a long time of knowing me.”
“I came out to my brother first because he is my best friend and not telling him was eating away at me. I felt like a liar every time I looked him in the eye.”
“I came out because it was something I wanted out in the open and I wanted to have friends I could talk to about it.”
“I came out to a small group of people (a mix of close family and friends) because I didn’t want to keep a part of myself I considered important completely to myself, and I think it’s important to be honest with those closest to you.”
“I told other people because I couldn’t keep it to myself any longer. I felt like the longer I kept it a secret, the more ashamed of it I would become, and I didn’t want to be ashamed of my sexuality.”
Some people are out because they’ve just discovered something about themselves and want to share it.
“When I found out that Asexuality was a thing, I first read everything on AVEN, then raced downstairs to my mom and showed her the site, all ‘mom, mom, I found my people! :D’”
“I’ve come out to a few friends, though not all of them. I did it because I was discovering this new thing in my life and I wanted to share it with someone.”
“I came out because I was excited to find out something new about myself that I’d never realized before, and I wanted to share it with everyone.”
“I was out within hours of discovering asexuality, simply because the closet is not a happy place.”
Others don’t tell people because they don’t feel other people need to know.
“If someone asks, I tell them. Otherwise I see no reason to tell them (unless they wish to engage in a sexual relationship with me).”
“I only come out if it is necessary and would not voluntarily do so to anyone I didn’t know well, as I don’t see how my orientation is most people’s business.”
“Also, it doesn’t really seem necessary for me to bring it up with most people. It wouldn’t really change anything, so why bother?”
“My asexuality is not something I make a big deal out of, and I don’t really feel the need to tell people unless they specifically ask whether I’m ace.”
Quite a few people remarked that others had already guessed that they were asexual.
“The best reactions came from my friends and ranged from “That explains a lot” to “I knew there was something different about you. Nice to know there’s a word for it.” ”
“The times that I’ve talked about it, it was to explain why I’ve been single all my life and plan to remain that way for the foreseeable future. That is, to explain what they’ve already noticed about me and found out of the ordinary.”
“One is my best friend, who is also asexual. That was easy… since she already suspected I was.”
“And my mom’s like “I guessed.””
“Almost all the conversations I’ve had about my asexuality with friends have been supportive. Notably, last year some article online spurred me to tell my housemates, “I don’t know if I’ve ever mentioned it, but I am asexual.” They replied, “Yes, we figured.” That was lovely and reassuring.”
“When I came out to one of my best friends, her initial reaction was “Wait, is this something you just figured out?” Apparently she’s known since 8th grade and I figured it out summer before sophomore year of college. We spent several minutes then with her just saying “How did you not know?!” and me replying “How was I supposed to know?””
“People were probably pegging me as asexual before I even knew the term, or even if they didn’t have a term for it themselves.”
“My best friend simply said “I’m not surprised” and accepted me wholeheartedly.”
Sometimes the person they’re coming out to is asexual as well.
“I told my best friend about it, but that was easy because he is asexual too!”
“As it turns out, she is also asexual, and she came out to me at the same time I came out to her.”
“One of my friends that I came out to actually told me that she is asexual too and now we both have someone that understands us and we can be completely open with.”
“The second person I ever came out to was my partner, and I was so upset by the thought of him dumping me and hating me just because I didn’t want into his pants that I started crying all over his shirt, which is hilarious in hindsight, especially since 15 seconds later he came out as asexual to me (serendipity!).”
And sometimes the other person knows someone who might be asexual.
“During the talk with both my parents we discussed a number of older relatives on both sides of the family who never married. My dad’s brother has never married and in all the time I’ve known him (going on 40 years) I’ve never seen him to have any romantic or sexual relationships. I don’t know if he is asexual or not, it’s not the kind of thing he would ever talk about. But my parents could understand me in the context of other people they knew who were similar.”
Some people expressed fears or doubts about coming out.
“I don’t know if I will ever tell my family as I’m pretty sure they won’t understand and will only hurt me by trying to be understanding.”
“I haven’t really thought about why I’m not out to most people, for the most part I think it’s none of their business, but there might be a slight fear in that as well, fear of not being accepted or that they don’t believe me or think I’m a freak.”
“I worry about what some people think, as I know they will tell me that it’s just a phase I’m going through.”
“I get more disbelief and confusion. I worry about being seen as attention seeking, especially with my own regular confusion about my own sexuality.”
“I’m not out to family yet though. I just don’t know how they will react, and I want to wait untill I have somewhere else I can go if they react poorly.”
Sometimes people are skeptical.
“One friend tried to convince me that I was simply straight and haven’t found the right guy.”
“Most people disbelived me and even asked numerous questions to try and find the reason behing my unwillingness to fuck. A lot of them sugested therapy and treated me as a labrat that is now open to scrutiny and can be used to prove or refute their own personal theories.”
“He preached to me for a good five minutes about how I couldn’t be sure I was asexual because I hadn’t had sex. And, he explained, he hadn’t enjoyed sex the first time either, so if I didn’t then I should try it again just in case. He’s flat out told me that I will have sex eventually, and that I was never a teenager because being a teenager is defined by having sex.”
“When I first came out to my mother, she dismissed it as me choosing to be celibate for we are Catholic.”
“My parents didn’t really understand what I was saying at all, and probably still don’t. My dad still thinks I’m gay but repressed, whereas my mum still wants grandchildren that I have no intention of giving.”
“I have come out to two people: my mom and my therapist. Both times were less than ideal. They didn’t really get it/ don’t seem to fully believe it. I haven’t come out to others because I am afraid they will not believe me.”
“One of my friends told me that I can’t be asexual because all adults want to have sex and I was just being immature and trying to sound like a special snow flake. I also tried to tell my parents but they told me I was too young to know what I am.”
Being out makes a difference in how other people feel about asexuality.
“But the more time passes and the more quietly and resolutely I stick to what I have said all along, the more acceptance I gain. My family are usually the first to fall in line.”
“The second person I told said that if I had just told him *about* asexuality without saying *I* was asexual, he would have been skeptical about its existence.”
“She insisted at first that I was just making stuff up to avoid social contact, but she’s come around since then and is now a great ally.”
“I got a lot of the “we’re worried you’ll be lonely” and “maybe you should try it” stuff from my parents, but once I’d explained that it was an orientation, they completely took me seriously and accepted me.”
“My parents’ response also wasn’t too bad, but it was still a long, five year process to get them to the point where we’re all really comfortable with their knowledge level. Now they’re proud, running around their rural community educating people on asexuality and all sorts of stuff.”
One person cited the “Just One Person” theory, where it only takes one out and visible person to make a difference in someone’s life.
“But more important than that, I want young aces to know they’re not alone. I felt so isolated through much of my adolescence, and I think that if I had known of one other ace, I wouldn’t have felt as confused and alone as I did. So I want to be that one other ace for young people.”
Occasionally, coming out can be very cathartic.
“It was extremely liberating. I felt ecstatic for days.”
“All around it was a really great experience. I cried from happiness because it felt like a weight had lifted off my chest.”
One person says they came out because their friends were playing matchmaker.
“I came out to my friends because they kept trying to set me up on dates with people and it was getting annoying.”
Sometimes aces come out non-chalantly.
“I have come out to a few people I only know online. But not in any grand statement, just a passing comment that fit the topic.”
“It has always been incidental to a conversation, rather than something I set out to do.”
“I’m out to my mother and all my close friends. Some various people from my high school knew, and so do some various people at Uni. I never had a huge “coming out” so to speak.”
Others will write a letter.
“I sent her an email with a link to AVEN and she overall took it really well.”
“I did it through letters, so I didn’t have to say anything.”
Or a text message.
“On the day I had decided was my coming out day I texted my mother from the light rail station with, “So I’m a homoromatic asexual. I’ll still prolly identify as a lesbian in most situations however, because my sex life is not that many people’s business.” She responded with, “Okay. You know I love and support you. :)” ”
Sometimes they’ll use various forms of social media to broadcast it.
“Yes, I’ve come out individually and en-masse via youtube.”
“I came out on my Tumblr blog first, because I have very good and open-minded friends there. I then came out on Facebook to all of my friends and family and got mostly positive responses.”
“I made a limited visibility post about it on Facebook. The response was underwhelming, but at least there was nothing negative. I got one supportive comment from my mom and one like from a friend.”
“I made a post about asexuality, in which I mentioned at the end that I was aro/ace, and I linked to it on Facebook, and so it’s entirely possible that many people I haven’t come out to know. That was kind of scary, and I’m not sure I would have done it again, but there were a lot of useless news stories about asexuality coming out, and one of my college friends came out to our group as aromantic and clearly had only just heard of it, and I wanted to do my part to increase awareness.”
And a couple of people were drunk when it happened.
“I told some others when we were discussing relationships, boys, who was attractive at the party, etc. while drunk.”
“I came out once – to three of my closest friends. We were at a party and VERY drunk. My three friends were talking about sex, my drunk mind decided now was a good time to tell them that I was asexual, so I did. They slurred “we love ya”, hugged me and continued talking about sex.”
One person came out in two languages while having ice cream in a foreign country.
“I think my ultimate positive coming out experience was when I was in Japan, and I went to lunch with an American friend, a couple of Dutch friends, and their Japanese friends (who spoke limited English), and, due to a series of slightly hilarious circumstances involving Sherlock, I wound up outing myself first in English and then in Japanese (because the Japanese girls wanted to know why the conversation on our end of the table had suddenly gotten so intense). Not only was it an incredibly validating experience for me in terms of language proficiency (I think that once you are able to explain human sexuality in a foreign language, you are probably getting close to fluency), everyone was very supportive and took it well. And that was how I wound up explaining human sexuality in two languages over parfaits.”
And finally, one person even used my book to come out. (Available on Amazon and Kindle!)
“My parents know. I sent them an email with a link to your book one night. The next morning, when I woke up, my mom took me out to breakfast and talked about it with me. Both of my parents were very supportive.”

No rest for the bunny
We had a wonderful Easter meal with Christopher and Megan and
Sam. Then we had the hunt, which was pretty funny. Steven and
I were so tired that we just left huge clusters of eggs all over the main
floor out in the open. Some were hidden, but it was pretty easy to get an impressive stash. We have to be really careful because of the dog. She once got very sick eating Christopher's chocolate.
On a sad note, my friend's mother died this morning.
She'd been quite sick for about a week, but had such
a strong personality that I was hoping she'd pull through
on will alone. I've been thinking of her all day as we went
through our family rituals -- silly as they may be. She
was such a presence in her family -- at every party,
giving kisses to her daughters and grandchildren. She always
cared about her appearance, and would be wearing a dress,
and maybe a special pin, and earrings. As she lived in the
neighbourhood I saw her more often than I've been able to
see my own mother in recent years. These mothers matter --
the mothers of friends. They are in a way shared, as we all
are in all of our motherly, or fatherly roles. I better go and work.
School is on again tomorrow.
Have a loving day.

"In the next few posts, you get the opportunity to check out some of ways my life has changed over the last 12 months (or 52 weeks or 366 days or 8784 hours or 527,040 minutes or 31,622,400 seconds - because some of these changes I look at in smaller measure to make them seem less big).
First change happened last February.
I started working regularly outside the home.
If you've been a reader for a while, you already know that my mr.'s 'one month non-voluntary vacation' threw me for a loop. I always thought that I would go back to work someday. Someday just came way sooner than expected.
It was a part time job that's turned into a 30 hour a week job this school year.
I'm a tutor that helps out a reading teacher.
I get to play with kids and help them learn.
If I need to be working, I'm blessed to be where I am.
Lessons: children will catch you yawning and don't even try resting your eyes for a bit, first graders pick their noses - a lot and it's a very common trait for the young men of that age to not zip up their trousers, liking your co-workers & what you are doing sure makes work life a lot more enjoyable (I'm really lucky with this one), planning home life (e.g. dinner) is top priority, every little person needs a champion (ok, that lesson is from long ago, but over the last few month's it's become more and more apparent), sometimes you are put in a place to do more than what the job description describes, and you can blow a grade-schooler's mind when you tell them 'See you next year!' right before Christmas break.
And when I say you, I mean me or ""I,"" to be grammatically correct.
It's been a wonderful Christmas break. We all go back to school next Monday. I'm excited to see what this new year in school will bring and who did their reading.",0.9774661064147949,427,0.8736118078231812
"BACKGROUND Progressive enhancement from the aortic main resulting in dissection may
BACKGROUND Progressive enhancement from the aortic main resulting in dissection may be the main reason behind premature loss of life in sufferers JW 55 with Marfan’s symptoms. after various other medical therapy got didn’t prevent intensifying aortic-root enhancement. The ARB was losartan in 17 irbesartan and patients in 1 patient. We examined the efficiency JW 55 of ARB therapy by evaluating the prices of modification in aortic-root size before and following the initiation of treatment with ARBs. Outcomes The suggest (±SD) price of modification in aortic-root size decreased considerably from 3.54±2.87 mm each year during previous medical therapy to 0.46±0.62 mm each year during ARB therapy (P<0.001). The deviation of aortic-root enhancement from regular as expressed with the price of modification in z ratings was reduced with a mean difference of just one 1.47 z ratings each year (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 2.24; P<0.001) following the initiation of ARB therapy. The sinotubular junction which is certainly susceptible to dilation in Marfan’s symptoms aswell also showed a lower life expectancy price of modification in size during ARB therapy (P<0.05) whereas the distal ascending aorta which will not normally become enlarged in Marfan’s symptoms was not suffering from ARB therapy. CONCLUSIONS In a little cohort study the usage of ARB therapy in sufferers with Marfan’s symptoms significantly slowed the speed of intensifying aortic-root dilation. These results require confirmation within a randomized trial. Marfan’s symptoms an autosomal prominent connective-tissue disorder impacting around 1 in 5000 people is certainly due to mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (mutations result in flaws in multiple body organ systems which one of the most life-threatening is certainly intensifying enhancement and dissection from the aortic main.3 4 Current medical JW 55 management of Marfan’s symptoms is targeted on serial cardiac-imaging research and the usage of pharmacologic agents to lessen hemodynamic pressure on the aortic wall structure. Pharmacologic treatment JW 55 frequently involves the usage of beta-adrenergic-receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) although various other agents such as for example angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers have already been used in sufferers who have undesirable adverse occasions or no response to beta-blockers.5-7 Research within a mouse style of Marfan’s symptoms have shown that the scarcity of fibrillin-1 in the extracellular matrix leads JW 55 to extreme signaling by transforming growth aspect (TGF-antagonists in vivo. The introduction of pathologic adjustments in the aortic wall structure and the intensifying dilation from the aortic main had been attenuated or avoided by systemic treatment using a TGF-signaling.10 12 Compared mutant mice treated using the beta-blocker propranolol continued showing substantial aortic-wall pathologic adjustments and got only a moderate decrease in the speed of aortic-root dilation. These results led us to hypothesize that treatment with ARBs may be effective for preventing aortic-root enhancement and linked cardiovascular pathologic adjustments in sufferers JW 55 with Marfan’s symptoms. METHODS STUDY Style AND Sufferers We retrospectively evaluated the records of most pediatric sufferers treated in the medical genetics center of Johns Hopkins Medical center who fulfilled the Ghent diagnostic requirements13 for Marfan’s symptoms and who had been implemented prospectively from Oct 1996 through November 2007. The medical diagnosis of Marfan’s symptoms was verified in each affected person after exclusion of various other known congenital aneurysm syndromes based on distinguishing phenotypic Rabbit polyclonal to PLK1. features molecular mutation evaluation or both (start to see the Supplementary Appendix obtainable with the entire text of the content at www.nejm.org). This retrospective research was accepted by the institutional review panel of Johns Hopkins College or university which waived the necessity for up to date consent. We determined a cohort of 18 sufferers with Marfan’s symptoms 14 a few months to 16 years who had started ARB therapy between November 2003 and could 2006 and got continued to get the treatment for at least 12 months of follow-up. Yet another patient was determined who was recommended an ARB but this individual was excluded through the analysis directly after we discovered documented intervals of nonadherence to therapy.

Making wealth endure. It's what inspires us and is at the core of everything we do. To capture this in our name, we thoughtfully selected ""Chequers"" for its rich history, symbolism and what we wish for our financial partners: substantial wealth.
Built by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 13th century, the Chequers Estate in England passed from generation to generation for over 700 years due in large part to well-designed family wealth transfer.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the estate was donated to the Crown by the Lord and Lady of Fareham to fulfill their vision for a more equitable political and social system—one where self-made men could rise in society without aristocratic birthright or privilege and become future leaders of the country through hard work.
The Chequers name represents the intersection of dynastic family wealth planning and self-made men—a story of how thoughtful financial choices set a framework for wealth to endure over generations.
Imagine if we can do that for you? Let's help make your wealth endure.",0.9472298622131348,226,2.3871164321899414
"StarSea Bit Exchange: The Role of AI in Revolutionizing the Trading Experience
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a game changer in a number of industries, and the world of finance and cryptocurrency trading is no exception. StarSea Bit Exchange, a rapidly growing cryptocurrency trading platform, has embraced AI to enhance its services and provide an efficient, seamless trading experience for its users. In this article, we will explore how AI is revolutionizing the trading experience within StarSea Bit Exchange and how it can benefit both individual traders and institutional investors.
Understanding StarSea Bit Exchange
StarSea Bit Exchange is a next-generation cryptocurrency trading platform that aims to provide a highly secure, fast, and user-friendly experience for traders around the globe. The exchange has gained popularity for its wide range of supported cryptocurrencies, high liquidity, and competitive fees. However, what really sets StarSea Bit Exchange apart from other platforms is its integration of artificial intelligence technologies to optimize and enhance its operations. Let’s delve into the various aspects where AI has made an impact within StarSea Bit Exchange.
1. AI-Powered Trading Bots
One of the most visible ways in which AI has transformed trading on StarSea Bit Exchange is through AI-powered trading bots. AI algorithms are capable of analyzing market data in real-time, identifying patterns, and making informed trading decisions faster than human traders. This allows traders on StarSea Bit Exchange to benefit from:
- Automated Trading Strategies: AI-powered trading bots are capable of executing trades automatically based on predefined strategies. This automation eliminates human emotion from the decision-making process, allowing for more disciplined trading and reducing the risk of errors.
- High-Frequency Trading (HFT): AI is capable of analyzing vast amounts of data at a lightning-fast pace, enabling high-frequency trading. HFT allows traders to take advantage of minor price movements, which can lead to significant profits over time.
- 24/7 Trading: With AI-powered bots, trading is not restricted to human working hours. These bots operate 24/7, allowing users to take advantage of opportunities in the market at any time.
- By leveraging AI-powered trading bots, StarSea Bit Exchange provides its users with the ability to benefit from fast-paced market changes without having to constantly monitor price movements themselves.
2. Advanced Market Analysis and Insights
AI has also played a crucial role in providing advanced market analysis and insights to traders on StarSea Bit Exchange. Traditional market analysis often involves a significant amount of manual effort and relies heavily on a trader’s experience and knowledge. AI-driven analytics tools, on the other hand, are capable of analyzing large datasets in a matter of seconds and providing actionable insights to users.
- Sentiment Analysis: AI models can analyze news articles, social media posts, and other online content to determine market sentiment. By aggregating and analyzing data from multiple sources, AI can help traders understand how different events may impact the price of cryptocurrencies.
- Predictive Analytics: By leveraging machine learning algorithms, StarSea Bit Exchange is able to offer predictive analytics tools that provide users with price forecasts and trend predictions. These tools help traders make more informed decisions when buying or selling cryptocurrencies.
- Chart Pattern Recognition: AI algorithms are capable of recognizing chart patterns that may indicate potential trading opportunities. These patterns, which can be difficult for human traders to identify, are analyzed by AI models that can generate timely alerts, allowing users to take advantage of price movements as soon as they occur.
- Through AI-driven market analysis, StarSea Bit Exchange equips traders with the tools they need to make better, data-driven decisions.
3. Enhanced Security Measures
The rise of cryptocurrency trading has brought with it concerns over security. Cryptocurrency exchanges have been targeted by hackers, resulting in the loss of user funds and private information. StarSea Bit Exchange uses AI to bolster its security measures and safeguard users from potential threats.
- Fraud Detection: AI algorithms are capable of identifying suspicious activity and flagging it in real-time. By analyzing user behavior and transaction data, AI models can recognize unusual patterns that may indicate fraudulent behavior, allowing the platform to take immediate action to prevent losses.
- Identity Verification: AI is used to verify user identities as part of the Know Your Customer (KYC) process. By utilizing facial recognition and document verification technologies, AI helps ensure that users are who they claim to be. This significantly reduces the risk of identity fraud and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Behavioral Analytics: AI-powered behavioral analytics monitor user actions on the platform, such as login attempts, IP address changes, and trading behavior. Any irregular activities are flagged, and immediate action is taken to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.
- The integration of AI into StarSea Bit Exchange’s security systems enhances the safety of the platform, building user trust and ensuring a secure trading environment.
4. Personalized User Experience
Personalization is key to creating a positive user experience, and AI has helped StarSea Bit Exchange deliver a customized trading experience that caters to the needs of each individual trader.
- Customized Trading Interface: AI is used to customize the trading interface based on user preferences. Depending on trading habits and preferences, AI algorithms can suggest personalized layouts and chart configurations, creating a more intuitive trading experience.
- Trade Recommendations: AI models analyze a user’s past trading behavior and make personalized trade recommendations based on their preferences. By identifying patterns and preferences, AI can help users discover new trading opportunities that align with their risk appetite and goals.
- Learning Resources: AI-driven recommendation engines are also used to provide traders with relevant learning resources, such as articles, video tutorials, and market analysis, tailored to their trading experience level. This personalized approach helps users enhance their trading knowledge and skills.
- By providing personalized services, StarSea Bit Exchange ensures that each trader has access to the tools and resources they need to succeed in their trading journey.
5. AI-Driven Customer Support
Customer support is an essential component of any cryptocurrency exchange, and StarSea Bit Exchange has integrated AI to provide responsive and efficient support for its users.
AI Chatbots: StarSea Bit Exchange utilizes AI-powered chatbots that are capable of answering frequently asked questions, providing instant support, and resolving common issues. These chatbots are available 24/7, which means users can receive assistance at any time without waiting for a human support agent.
Language Translation: AI is used to provide multilingual support to users from different parts of the world. By using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, AI can automatically translate customer queries and responses, ensuring that users receive support in their preferred language.
Escalation and Issue Resolution: AI can also be used to identify more complex user issues and automatically escalate them to the appropriate human support agents. This ensures that users receive timely and accurate assistance for issues that require human intervention.
The use of AI in customer support helps StarSea Bit Exchange improve response times and provide a more positive customer experience.
6. AI and Liquidity Management
Liquidity is a critical factor for any cryptocurrency exchange, as it directly impacts the trading experience. AI plays an important role in liquidity management at StarSea Bit Exchange by:
Order Book Optimization: AI models analyze order book data to identify opportunities for optimizing liquidity. By monitoring trading activity and adjusting order book parameters, AI helps maintain optimal liquidity levels, reducing the risk of slippage for users.
Market Making: AI-powered market-making bots help to provide liquidity by placing buy and sell orders at competitive prices. This ensures that traders have access to a liquid market and that they can execute their trades quickly without significantly impacting the market price.
AI’s role in liquidity management helps create a seamless trading experience for users, regardless of their trading volume.
7. Regulatory Compliance
The cryptocurrency space is constantly evolving, and regulatory compliance is an ongoing challenge for exchanges. AI helps StarSea Bit Exchange navigate the complex regulatory landscape by:
Transaction Monitoring: AI is used to monitor transactions in real-time, flagging any suspicious activity that may indicate money laundering or other illicit activities. By analyzing transaction data, AI helps ensure that the platform remains compliant with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.
Automated Reporting: AI-driven compliance tools automate the process of generating reports required by regulators. This reduces the burden on compliance teams and helps ensure that the exchange meets all regulatory requirements in a timely manner.
By leveraging AI for regulatory compliance, StarSea Bit Exchange ensures that it operates in accordance with the law while providing a safe and secure trading environment for its users.
The integration of artificial intelligence into StarSea Bit Exchange has significantly improved the trading experience for its users by providing AI-powered trading bots, advanced market analysis, enhanced security, personalized user experiences, AI-driven customer support, liquidity management, and regulatory compliance. AI has helped streamline operations, reduce risks, and create a more user-friendly platform, making StarSea Bit Exchange a preferred choice for traders.
As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow and evolve, AI will continue to play an important role in shaping the future of trading platforms like StarSea Bit Exchange. By staying at the forefront of AI adoption, StarSea Bit Exchange is well-positioned to lead the way in providing a secure, efficient, and personalized trading experience for users around the globe.",0.925316572189331,1921,1.2941744327545166

"Well, this 2020 spring sure snuck up on us. Down here in the southwest, the temps are getting into the 70s already in March, so we are looking at some DIY projects. We have decided that an DIY outdoor kitchen is what my father-in-law’s backyard needs. He’s super excited and we started talking and discussing the build and what we would want in the structure.
We have a few hundred square feet to work with, so we have some different shapes and configurations available to us. There is a gorgeous mountain view to our east, so we definitely want to keep that on our mind when we design the layout.
First and foremost, my father-in-law loves to cook on charcoal, so we are headed in that direction with the grill. We picked out a Char-Broil brand structure that we’ll modify to fit the space. That’s a real cool way to build and very economical, so we’ll be getting into that in some future posts. Secondly, we are looking to match the exterior of the outdoor fireplace that we built last year on the opposite side of the backyard. In order to do that, we’ll be putting stucco and outdoor lighting on our DIY outdoor kitchen, with flagstone as our counter material. By using the same finish material on the grill and fireplace, it’ll look like we built both structures at the same time and the overall look of the backyard will look well thought out.
We decided that a raised bar area would be a nice addition to the DIY outdoor kitchen, so the structure will have to be big enough to accommodate that extra feature. An “L” shape is something we feel will work so the guests sitting at the bar will have the mountain view to look at while they talk to the grill chef and enjoy their favorite beverage.
Starting the Construction
We staked out the rough dimension of the “L” shape grill and then started figuring out the level of the future concrete slab. This is important so our patio pavers are the same height of the patio to the house. The excavation of the site started with a quick dig out of the slab dimension.
Using a really long level, 6-footer, we laid out random pavers from the existing patio to the farthest side of the DIY outdoor kitchen structure. This would tell us how much digging we would need to do to get it uniform and level.
Drawing and Block Count/Order
Dan at Backyard Flare drew up the grill structure using CAD and concept and then used the drawing to calculate the type of blocks and exact number of each block needed. Dan figured the mortar and concrete need as well, and then called Lowes to place the order for delivery. The best part is that almost all the building materials and even the grill will be delivered right to the side of the house, which is where the gate is located leading to the backyard. The materials purchased, including the $75 delivery fee, was only $505, and that included the grill. Wow, how much more economical can it get?
Follow along on our future posts as we build. You’ll be amazed at how easy and inexpensive it can actually be to build on your own. The DIY world is yours to explore and we can help. If you’re interested in building your own backyard paradise, let us know how we can help. Get your construction plan today and begin building your DIY outdoor kitchen tomorrow.

Con Brio is a seven piece band that formed in San Francisco in 2009. Their latest single, ""Traunch,"" is an instantly compelling burst of rock, soul, funk, punk, R&B... and about a thousand various subgenres. The song introduces vocalist Sarah Clarke, who gets compared to both Sharon Jones and Janis Joplin. Seeing as we're making comparisons, Con Brio are reminding me of Downtown Boys meet Eli Paperboy Reed meets The White Stripes. A song like ""Traunch"" rocks just as hard as it grooves, to the point that you're going to try and headbang and dance at the same time. Each musical genre Con Brio encapsulate pokes out to take over at various times, but never to overwhelm the others. This song is absolutely fantastic.

"Multi-spectral imaging captures image data at specific frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum. Whilst the human eye can see a variety of colours ranging from violet to red, wavelengths can be shorter (ultraviolet) or longer (infrared), which are invisible to the naked eye. These invisible wavebands are very indicative of the characteristics of the soil, plants and crops, which make them extremely useful in all types of vegetation analysis.
Using a drone to capture these images is advantageous to other methods such as satellite images or manned aircrafts; a drone is less likely to be hindered by clouds or atmospheric conditions; the images can be captured at specific times of day when they can give more effective readings; and it is a far more cost-effective way of taking the images.
Using the Micasense Altum sensor mounted on a DJI Inspire 2 we are able to capture multi spectral imagery.The Altum sensor captures six bands blue, green, red, red edge, near infrared (NIR) and thermal all during the one flight. Images are processed using Agisoft Metashape Professional.
Data can be supplied as separate bands or RGB, composite infra red or composite red edge. For further analysis the data can also be supplied as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) or NDRE (Normalized Difference red edge).
What is NDVI and NDRE?
NDVI and NDRE are spectral indices constructed from a combination of two distinct frequencies of light. NDVI is built up from a combination of visual red light and near-infrared (NIR) light. NDRE uses a combination of NIR light and a frequency band that sits on the transition region between visual red and NIR light — hence the name “Red Edge”.
NDVI is the most common index used to indicate the density of vegetation. NDVI is calculated (NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red). It’s basically the ‘greeness’ of the plant, which shows when it is growing through the process of photosynthesis. Vegetation which is photosynthetically active absorbs more red light and reflects infrared light, whereas dead vegetation reflects more red light and less infrared light.Therefore, by using NDVI processing, we can asses the strength of vegetation.
NDRE is an index that can only be formulated when the Red edge band is available in a sensor. NDRE is calculated (NIR-RedEdge)/(NIR+RedEdge) It is sensitive to chlorophyll content in leaves (how green a leaf appears), variability in leaf area, and soil background effects. NDRE is a better indicator of vegetation health/vigor than NDVI for mid to late season crops that have accumulated high levels of chlorophyll in their leaves because red-edge light is more translucent to leaves than red light and so it is less likely to be completely absorbed by a canopy.",0.920943021774292,592,3.6008517742156982

Unleashing his third studio album, This Old Dog (2017), Lo-fi artist Mac DeMarco explores romance, self-growth and provides dad friendly tunes. Known for his peculiar stage and online presence, this young Edmonton native’s music juxtaposition what he portrays on stage.
DeMarco provides more of a softer and poise sonic sound with his new record. DeMarco’s previous records, Another One (2015) and Salad Days (2014) rewarded him with a signature sound and successful acclaim. After releasing both LPs back to back, the 27 year old decided to take a break for a year to record his latest record as well as move homes. Recording, producing and mixing the album himself in his own studio, the record was available for streaming on May 5th via Captured Tracks and Royal Mountain Records. Acoustic guitars open the record in both “My Old Man” and “This Old Dog” which were both singles earlier this year.
The album then transitions smoothly into “Baby You’re Out” and then to a track which is a toast to his lover called “For The First Time.” Aside from being a multi-instrumentalist, DeMarco lyricism has always caught the ear of any listener. Poetic and insightful words that are embellished with serene vocals allow the listener to not feel overwhelmed but to be left in a trance. Songs like “Moonlight On The River” with his classic delay effects paired with a simple bass-line will put you in a state of tranquility. The album itself strays from his precedent style like the excessive effects and louder sounds — although songs like “Still Beating” and “Another One” allow OG DeMarco fans to find solidarity through this record as blues-y and woozy guitar-lines exist through these tracks. His growth and humility is what shines through this album with a bit of melancholy through the lyrics —“Looks like I’m seeing a bit of my old man in me” sung in “This Old Man” to “I’m home, there’s moonlight on the river, everybody dies” in the melodic chill track “Moonlight On The River.” If you are a DeMarco fan, this album will definitely come out as a bit of a change much like it was to myself but! It shall grow on you.

Deciding that you want to separate from your spouse or partner can be an incredibly difficult decision, but once you’ve made the choice it’s important to know how to go about getting a divorce so that you can move on with your life. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania has specific laws regarding marriage and divorce which will become significant when you attempt to contact a divorce attorney in Harrisburg in order to gain more information on how to go about beginning the process. While trial separations are never easy, knowing which steps to take can help make the process significantly easier and more manageable while you try to figure out how to proceed.
First and foremost, it is important to know the difference between a ‘legal separation’ and a ‘divorce’. A legal separation is just that – a marriage between individuals who wish to separate. A divorce dissolves all legal relationships between two people. If you know for certain that you wish to receive a divorce, then it will be important to know where to locate a divorce attorney Harrisburg, since negotiating in court without an attorney can be difficult and will probably reflect poorly on you unless you are well-versed in legal vernacular.
The first step which your divorce attorney in Harrisburg will recommend will be to file a petition for divorce. Once the petition has been filed, the process will have begun, and your spouse will be given a specific number of days to respond to the petition. Once your spouse replies, the clerk of the court will either set a date and time for the two of you to meet in court and discuss your case in front of a judge, or arrange a time for mediation where you and your spouse will be able to attempt to come to amicable terms of agreement on division of property and possessions.
Having negotiated your terms with your divorce attorney in Harrisburg, you will be prepared for all eventual outcomes resulting from the judge’s opinion of your case, or your negotiations with your spouse. If all goes well, you should find yourselves divorced from one another, and ready to proceed with the rest of your independent lives. If you do not feel that a fair conclusion was reached in your divorce, you may ask to have the case returned to trial for reinvestigation.",0.9587144255638123,467,1.0562649965286255

"The Back of Beyond, The Men Who Would Be Kings, 28mm
Hurrah! With Spring almost upon us it was time for the first ‘League of Gentlemen Wargamers’ get-together of the year! that involves a weekend in Kirriemuir (just an hour’s drive from the ferry port at Aberdeen), a large game, and a chance to catch up, game, eat and drink with old friends. This one promised to be even better than usual, as it was a ‘Back of Beyond’ game – very loosely based on the Russian Civil War in Central Asia. Urrah! For this one, we divided up into five two-player factions – the Reds, the Whites, the British, the Chinese and the Muslims. Kieron and I played the part of the locals – the forces of the Emir of Samarkand and his Turkish commander Enver Pasha.Essentially, we were in the middle of a cross-shaped table, with the other factions each heading towards Samarkand, plump in the centre of the cross. In all, the game involved around 1,200 figures, plus other cool toys. As usual, there was plenty of room for skullduggery, alliances, treachery, special events, the search for money, mercenaries and zeppelins for hire, boats, aircraft, armoured trains and spies.Oh, and that little shit TinTin, who spent the game helping the British, and proving he and his dog Snowy were bullet proof! Every team had their own secret agenda, unique victory conditions, and set of likely opponents. Apart from that it was a real free-for-all…The mayhem was expertly umpired by Chris and Donald, who kept throwing in interesting events, or special opportunities. For instance, the Bank of Uzbekistan in the centre of Samarkand was up for robbing, and both the locals and the White made good use of it.My Basmachi tribesmen even came across a Buddhist temple, where they had to stop for a turn, as the peace and good karma of the place gave them pause! It was all excellent chrome. Meanwhile, the four factions advanced steadily towards the city. That’s the Whites advancing towards the city gates above, after disembarking from their river transport, while down below the British and their local allies are seen doing the same from the opposite side of the city.The Reds and Chinese of course, were doing the same, with the Reds passing the encampment of Wagnergruppen, some German mercenaries, available for hire to any faction. Naturally the Red players Bill and Steve were quick to do a deal with them!It made good diplomatic sense to form alliances with other factions. We made one with the Whites (played by Peter and Dale), which amazingly lasted throughout the whole game. We also had non-aggression alliances with the Reds and Chinese, which didn’t last quite so long. The British though, refused to do a deal, as their victory conditions involved fighting their way through to the Blue Mosque, to free an important British archaeologist held there!So, the mayhem slowly ran its course. Occasionally aircraft appeared, and dogfights were fought in the skies over the city, or the troops of enemy factions were strafed or bombed. It was all good – in fact excellent – fun, especially when nobody really knew what to expect next!Eventually, all the four advancing factions reached the city, and fighting broke out between just about everybody. For us Muslims, the key victory conditions were the holding of the Blue Mosque, and the Emir’s Palace, a grandiose building on the edge of town that became a battleground.Over on the far side of town the British and the reds made an unholy non-aggression deal, which allowed the Brits to sprint forward into the town centre. The Whites weren’t much use either, as they wouldn’t shoot at the British – or even the Reds for a fair bit of the game! Unholy alliances indeed!In the palace complex the Chinese filled the place with troops, where they faced off Kieron’s palace guards, while the rest of the Chinese faction massed close to the Blue Mosque, as if getting ready to attack. All this, of course, at a time when we were busy fighting both the Reds and the British..In fact the Reds martial ardour was cooled when the remnants of the much-bloodied Wagnergruppen mercenaries packed up and went home – partly as I’d just liberated their wages from the bank. The British though, were up for some tense house-to-house fighting, in the Stalingrad of Uzbekistan.Still, we held them off, and even stopped a desperate British lunge towards the mosque, let by that little shit Tin Tin. In the end though, our real threat came from the Chinese, who broke their treaty with the Muslims, and attacked the Palace. Kieron though, held off Kevin’s troops with grim aplomb. Over by the Blue Mosque the Chinese assault also came to naught. I lost my armoured car, but apart from that the Muslim defenders stood firm, and gunned down Martin’s attacking Chinese in droves. That meant by the end of the game, all our objectives – the defence of the Palace and the Mosque – had been met, and the Emir of Samarkand was safely ensconced in his palace. It was touch and go though, as the British were still driving forward.So, helped by this, and by our robbing of the bank, we won the game on points. The Whites came next, followed by the British, and then the less successful Reds and Chinese. The main thing though, was that everyone had a blast! The Back of Beyond, as ever, lived up to its reputation as the most entertaining wargame period of them all!",0.9801624417304993,1216,0.7937569618225098
"Martingale is a betting system that originated long before Las Vegas and gambling is a twinkle in the eyes of Bugsy Siegel. In fact, this strategy originated in 18th century France. Rumored to be the brainchild of ruthless casino owner John Martindale.
Judi Online , As you may have guessed, the Martingale system name is a play on the family name Mr. Martindale. It is important to note that Mr. Martindale does not use the system itself, but strongly recommends its use among its gambling customers. He would regularly suggest to his players that other gamblers had consistently won large amounts of money using the system.
Sadly, since most successful gambling systems fly in the face of conventional logic, they will agree with this idea. Today, I’m going to share the joys and sorrows of the Martingale and in what specific situations it can work and why. I will also define and evaluate the Anti-Martingale variation of the system.
The Martingale system is one of the most popular betting strategies employed by recreational players around the world. This is because it has a straight forward and seemingly rational approach. Players believe the easier the philosophy the better and of course it is. Players do not have to commit to memory complex equations or quickly calculate the bet amount in their head.
This system can be easily implemented in online casinos as well as in traditional brick and mortar establishments. Over the years there have been dozens of variations on the Martingale system. All of these variations orbit around the main idea of increasing or decreasing the stake after losing.
In most cases this system is applied to games of odds that are close to winning 50/50 on a losing outcome. Like black and red Roulette bets or passes and don’t cross the line at the craps table. A less common but without question, to which the Martingale system can apply, is Baccarat.
The traditional Martingale system only doubles the next bet after a loss has occurred. When victory is achieved, a new cycle begins. The strength of the system is that the player wins the highest bet of the cycle.
Consider the following hypothesis:
If a player starts with a $ 1 bet and, loses that bet. Their next bet is $ 2 dollars, and if the player loses that bet, their next bet is $ 4. If the bet is won, the cycle will restart and the player starts betting with $ 1 again.
Advantages of Using the Martingale System in Gambling
This approach guarantees that the player will win the biggest bet of each betting cycle. At first glance and into the mathematical challenge, the Martingale system appears to be a superior approach to coin-flip games. Novice players saw this as essentially having a license to print money.
Like the perception of a parking lot near the door in a shopping mall on Black Friday, Martingale, too, is an illusion. This system opens players up to impossible but very high risk approaches and to very minimal prizes.
The Martingale system plays on the statistical probability of odds and lures players to a false sense of security. Provides an illusion where the approach shows that the player has very high odds. To win some small amounts and have a very low chance of losing large amounts of money. Because players often win small amounts, players fall into the wrong perception. That winning more often means winning more total dollars.
This, I can assure you, is not the case.
Finally, since most of the games applied to the Martingale system are subject to the laws of trial mathematics. Which inherently states that each event is independent of the last. There is no way for players to feel safe in their play without additional hedging.
I’ll be back there soon. Next, I would like to address some of the major drawbacks with the Martingale system.
A popular variation of the Martingale system is the Anti-Martingale system. The premise here is to half the stake after each bet and double the stake after each win. This variation is betting on the streak but again in the long run, players will see a steady decline in their bankroll.
Like the traditional Martingale system, the independent trial law causes this to fail. Players will sooner or later reach a streak where losing will eliminate all wins. There are ways to hedge your bets when using the Martingale betting system which gives players positive expectations. But they can only be used for a very short time and have no long term possibilities.
The way players do this is by using promotional chips. These are the chips offered to players by the casino which can be wagered but have no cash value. So if the player wins they get the money but if they lose the bet it doesn’t cost you anything.
This is basically a free bet. This shifts the percentage because there is no negative edge on the bet. It’s really playing with “house money.” The Martingale is not a system that leads to positive expectations for players, and should not be treated as such. Even considering using a method to generate money hedging methods such as promotional chips should be used.
The Martingale Betting System can only be successful when its main principles are upheld. You really have to keep doubling your bet until you win. If this pattern is broken at any point or limited by external factors, it falls into theory and practice.
Hence, if you are looking for bigger blackjack or roulette profits then you should look beyond this strategy. Although there are some benefits to it when used in small doses. Relying on it as a complete betting system would be an expensive mistake. One that will eventually force you to break any bankroll management rules. Which you may have set yourself.",0.9646750092506409,1201,1.722590684890747

It was September 5, 1984, Ginger Hayden’s first day at the University of Texas at Arlington. Ginger, an auburn-haired beauty of just 18 years, had graduated from Arlington Heights High School, just three months earlier. Today, a new chapter of her life was beginning. She had dreams of becoming a physiotherapist and could hardly wait to get started with her studies.
Which made it odd that she was so tardy in rising, on this of all days. Lying in her bed in the adjacent room, Ginger’s mom, Sharon, could hear her daughter’s alarm beeping consistently without being turned off. Sharon had worked a late shift at her job the previous night, arriving home at around 2:00 a.m. The apartment had been dark and quiet when she’d entered, and she’d gone straight to bed. Now, the alarm had roused her from sleeping. Looking bleary-eyed at her bedside clock, she saw that it was 6:00 a.m. After yelling several times for Ginger to turn the alarm off, she got out of bed and walked wearily to her daughter’s room. What she found there was a waking nightmare.
Ginger was in a kneeling position, face down on the floor next to her bed. She was partially nude, her pale skin covered with ugly, red-streaked wounds. To her horror, Sharon realized that it was blood and that it was everywhere – on the bed sheets, the walls, the closet doors, seeped into the carpet. Sharon fell to her knees beside her daughter’s body, placed a hand on her back, and felt the cold, lifeless skin under her touch. She staggered to her feet, reeled into the passage, using the wall for support. Moments later, the phone was in her hand, and she was dialing. “My baby’s dead,” she told the operator in a monotone. Then she repeated that sentence, her voice rising hysterically. Then she screamed it down the line, screamed it so loudly that she woke her neighbors. Already, the operator was connecting the call to the police. On the day that should have been her first at college, Ginger Hayden left her apartment in a body bag.
The response from the Fort Worth Police was emphatic. CSIs swarmed all over the residence. Meanwhile, detectives and uniformed officers started canvassing the apartment complex to see if any of the neighbors had seen or heard anything. Sharon, numb with shock and grief, was also questioned. From her, officers learned that Ginger had been dating a young man named Jeff Green. Jeff was roused from sleep to the distressing news that his girlfriend had been murdered. He was then brought to the police station to answer questions.
Meanwhile, crime scene officers were methodically processing the Hayden apartment, collecting trace evidence – blood, hair, and fibers – meticulously photographing the scene, dusting for fingerprints. Perhaps the most important piece of evidence was the murder weapon, a wooden-handled knife found lying on the bedroom floor by the victim’s feet. The knife belonged to a set in the kitchen. It had been wielded with such savage force that the blade was bent, the handle broken. CSIs then moved into the bathroom where they found evidence that the killer had washed up before he left. They also found two bloody socks which he’d used as makeshift gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints on the murder weapon. The socks belonged to the victim. An important find was a single pubic hair. In those pre-DNA days, it was of limited use. Nonetheless, they bagged it.
Back at the police station, an apparently distraught Jeff Green was accounting for his whereabouts the previous day. According to Jeff, he and Ginger had spent the morning with a friend, Ryland “Shane” Absalon. He’d later dropped Ginger at her job, where she had to work an afternoon shift. He and Shane had hung out together until that evening, when he left Shane and went to pick up Ginger from work. He and Ginger then returned to her apartment, where they had sex. They also talked for a time about their future. Ginger had recently discovered that she was pregnant, and they were trying to decide what to do. He left her at around 11:30 p.m. That was the last time he saw his girlfriend.
Jeff Green had answered all the questions put to him in a forthright manner. Officers had no reason to believe that he was lying to them. Although he remained on the suspect list, he was allowed to go. Now, attention shifted to another person of interest, Ryland “Shane” Absalon.
Initial inquiries indicated that Shane lived with his father in the apartment directly above Sharon and Ginger Hayden. Questioning Shane’s father, detectives learned that he’d been awakened that morning by Sharon’s screams. He’d walked to the living room where he found his son already up. Shane’s t-shirt had a large reddish stain on it, which Shane claimed was from a strawberry soda he’d spilled. The officers asked to see the shirt. Shane said that he could not remember where he’d put it. They then asked if they could search the apartment. That search turned up a pair of Shane’s shoes, which had a small bloodstain on them. These were bagged as evidence.
Shane Absalon had now been flagged as a prime suspect in the case. However, the police had no real evidence to bring against him. No one had seen him enter Ginger’s apartment and he was adamant that he had not seen her since the previous morning. His dad could not account for Shane’s whereabouts. He said that he’d gone out drinking after work and had arrived home drunk and gone straight to bed. The forensics were not much use either. The technology of the day was simply not up to the task of matching any of it to Shane Absalon. Shane was then asked to take a polygraph but refused. Just like that, the case was dead in the water.
More than two decades went by. This was an era marked by incredible advances in forensic techniques, particularly in the area of DNA matching. In the mid-2000s, the Fort Worth Police Department announced the formation of a Cold Case Unit, specifically tasked with reviewing old, unsolved cases, using the technologies now at their disposal. But the technology was prohibitively expensive back then. Most law enforcement agencies could not afford it without federal funding. In 2009, Fort Worth PD received such a grant. One of the first cases flagged for review was the murder of Ginger Hayden.
The initial results were disappointing. The only DNA match that the lab was able to find was to Jeff Green. Since Jeff and Ginger had engaged in consensual sex on the night she died, this had been expected. But then, lab technicians tested a towel from the Hayden residence and found the DNA of an unknown male. This same DNA was later extracted from two biological samples. It matched the pubic hair found at the crime scene. It also was a match to the blood droplet found on Shane Ryland’s shoes. Whose DNA was it? The cold case investigators thought they knew. They’d need a swab from Shane Absalon to prove their thesis.
Absalon had since left the Fort Worth area and was living in Arizona. Approached by Fort Worth investigators, he flatly refused to give a DNA sample. Fortunately, they had anticipated this and came armed with a warrant. Absalon was compelled to submit. The buccal swab was brought back to Fort Worth for analysis. Several months later, the results were in. It was a match.
Ryland “Shane” Absalon was arrested at his home in Sierra Vista, Arizona, on August 29, 2010, nearly 26 years after the murder of Ginger Hayden. He was charged with capital murder and bound over for trial. It was here that the case took an unexpected turn. With the details of the murder splashed all over the media, the police received a call from a man named Shawn Garrett. Garrett had some interesting information to share. It seems Absalon had confessed the murder to him...two decades earlier!
At the time, Garrett and Absalon had both been enrolled in a substance abuse treatment program at Straight, Inc. The rules of the program required new enrollees to room with participants who were further along in their recovery. Thus, Absalon ended up living with Shawn Garrett and his parents. The two men shared a room, Garrett said, and often had long conversations at night. During one of these talks, Absalon made a startling disclosure. He said that he’d murdered a young woman some years earlier, after she’d rejected him. He’d wanted a romantic involvement with the woman. She’d said that she did not feel that way about him and just wanted to be friends. The rejection had left him embarrassed. He’d decided to have his revenge.
According to Absalon, he’d snuck into the woman’s apartment and hid in her closet. He’d waited for her to fall asleep and then crept up on her with a kitchen knife in his hand. He’d started stabbing her, keeping up the attack until she stopped struggling and lay still. Then he’d cleaned up the scene and left. “They’ll never catch me,” he boasted. “I did a real good job covering my tracks.”
As it turned out, Shawn Garrett wasn’t the only one who had heard this confession. Absalon had told the story several times in group therapy sessions. Those who’d heard it weren’t sure if they believed him. They were barred from repeating the story, in any case. The rules of the program were that anything said in group sessions was to remain confidential.
Ryland Absalon went on trial for murder in September 2012. The case against him was powerful, with a DNA match and several witnesses who had heard him confess to the murder. The defense would attack both strands of evidence. First, they tried to have testimony relating to Absalon’s admissions excluded. The argument was that these were protected by their client’s right to confidentiality. Unfortunately for Absalon, this wasn’t entirely true. The confidentiality clause only applied to those who had voluntarily enrolled in the program. Absalon had been ordered to attend by a judge. Besides, Absalon had made his confession to Shawn Garrett outside a therapy session. That, certainly, was not protected.
As for the forensic evidence, the defense took the obvious stance of stating that Absalon was a friend of the victim and had been inside her apartment on numerous occasions. It would have been unusual had his DNA not been found, his lawyer insisted. He then offered an alternative suspect. During the early 1980s, Fort Worth had been plagued by a series of murders of attractive young women. The police force had been so concerned that they’d formed a task force to investigate the murders. Several of the crimes remained unsolved. The defense was suggesting that a serial killer had killed Ginger Hayden.
Unfortunately for the defense, this unnamed serial killer (if he even existed) had not confessed to Ginger’s murder. The defendant had and now he was going to have to face the consequences of his actions. Found guilty of aggravated murder, Ryland “Shane” Absalon was sentenced to life in prison. The law in effect at the time of the murder means that he will be eligible for parole in 20 years. Absalon should consider himself lucky that the D.A. did not decide to seek the death penalty. But for that, he’d be sitting on death row right now. No one can say he wouldn’t deserve it.",0.9901723265647888,2771,0.9717583060264587

For a start we began with our newage models in the house, our kids
You can also buy one of these DSLRs and grow as a photopro with the kid or call us over to capture some candid kid moments. You`ll be amazed what a DSLR in professional hands could accomplish.
And this is what we do with just the camera, and Mind You, not the Photoshop, cause You see, we are a bit old fashioned. We`ve been lucky to have been joined by another fantastic model in this lady. Tantrums Galore, She`s been an absolute delight for the photographer.

"A Qualitative Assessment of a Training and Communication Intervention on Antibiotic Prescription Practices Among Health Workers and Outpatients at Public Health Facilities in Uganda.

BACKGROUND: Antibiotic prescribing practices are 1 of the contributing causes of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The study explored the key drivers and barriers to adherence to prescribing instructions among healthcare workers and outpatient attendees with the aim of developing a training and communication intervention to improve adherence to prescription. METHODS: Prior to randomized trials at 3 health centers in Uganda (Aduku, Kihihi, and Nagongera), a pre-intervention qualitative assessment was conducted to explore behavioral drivers for adherence to prescriptions and the communication of adherence messages. Based on the findings, a training and communication package was developed for healthcare workers and patients at Day 0 of the trial. During the trial's Day 7 patient follow-up, in-depth interviews were conducted to further investigate adherence behaviors. RESULTS: Five main themes were identified that acted as drivers or barriers to prescription adherence. Key drivers included: drug availability at health facility, health worker knowledge, and communication to patients.

"Terrorists in Syria received U.S.-made anti-aircraft systems and launched Grad missiles on Aleppo
The West’s policy towards Syria cannot be described just as one of “double standards” anymore, Zakharova told journalists during the briefing, saying that “there is an attempt to directly assist the militants and terrorists.”
(RT) ~ Militant groups in Syria were supplied with US-made man-portable surface-to-air missiles, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, adding that the West’s actions in Syria look like an attempt to render assistance to terrorists.
The Russian Foreign Ministry, she said during a news briefing, is aware of “militants [in Syria] receiving US-manufactured man-portable air-defense systems,” adding that “Jihadists operating in the Aleppo region continue to be supplied with arms and ammunition.”

"Artist John K. Snyder III brings classic DC to you in living color…
No big intro needed here, folks:
I was moseying through Facebook the other day and came upon this lovely quartet of Golden Age Batman images by artist John K. Snyder III, who did fine work for DC Comics in the ’80s and ’90s:
My goodness, is that pretty or what?
Not just that, it turned out John also illustrated others in the DC canon:
And for good measure, here’s a hero who pre-dates them all, to make for 13 fab images:
“I love the Golden Age and classic characters,” John told me. “This was a batch of them I did over the summer, and I love the inset circle format, like the old Golden Age covers when the characters were featured in the upper corners.”

"CostCare’s ‘Direct Primary Care’ Continues To Gain Momentum In Montana
CostCare, a Missoula-based medical company, announced the one-year anniversary of offering its “Direct Primary Care” model. CostCare co-founder Dr. Carol Bridges says there are five DPC clinics in Montana.
“Direct Primary Care is a membership type model for primary care,” Bridges said. “People pay a monthly fee and with that, all of their office visits are covered. Pretty much anything we can do in the office itself is included in the membership fee.”
According to Bridges, this monthly membership is extremely affordable for most Montanans.
“The monthly membership for adults is $70 a month and then for children it is $25 a month until they reach the end of high school, but they have to be on with an adult membership,” Bridges said. “The average emergency room charge in this country now is like $2,600. That is three years of your primary care paid for if I can prevent you from going into one emergency room.”
Bridges says the child membership price is significantly cheaper so that larger families can afford the care they need. She says you get to name your provider when you sign up. After that, you receive an email with your provider’s contact information.
“They can then access us via office visits, email, text, call, or FaceTime,” Bridges said. “We are much more readily available and we can try to prevent them from going to the emergency room or going to the hospital. Sometimes I don’t necessarily need to see the patient in the office. We can handle a lot of things over the phone or via text.”
Bridges says she can’t wait until we get to the point where we don’t have to deal with insurance anymore. In the future, she hopes it will be all about the provider and patient relationship.",0.9672679305076599,418,1.3761674165725708

You can now experience part of that dream, by chartering her in the Mediterranean this summer from 165,000 Eur per week. She can accommodate 10 to 12 guests on board, and in case the price is too steep for one family, we welcome enquiries by couples or other families to experience this spectacular yacht.

Consider splashing this summer to reward your family members with an exceptional superyacht charter full of fun, adventures, luxury surroundings and last but not least exceptional sailing performance.
S/Y SILENCIO regularly participated in major superyacht regattas, including PERINI NAVI CUP, as she is not only a luxury superyacht cruiser, but also a fast and stable, performance-oriented sailing yacht. In fact ,she is known as fierce sailing competitor claiming victories in aforementioned Perini Navi Cup as well as the New Zealand Millennium Cup.

"The first thing everyone should know about revolution in Ukraine is that revolution there is fueled by Ukrainian nationalists and American money they get from Washington. Every country where Americans supported revolutions like Libya or Egypt is still covered by that revolutionary agony and these countries will never be serene again. In half of Ukraine where positions of nationalists are strong anti-Jewish bashings became something ordinary. The most terrible thing is that the 'civilized and democratic' world supports nationalists like they are really fighting for freedom while they are fighting for ethnically clean Ukraine without Jews and it seems Europe and America are satisfied with that. I can't find any excuse for our authorities and their support for nationalists because we participate in provoking of a civil war in Ukraine and of course as a part of it we will take all responsibility.
No, it is fuelled by Putin and his cronies, who are trying everything they can to stop Ukraine from turning towards the EU.
The Ukranian government are in the minority now, and the beatings and 'disappearings' are starting. They are puppets for Moscow, who are either being intimidated or bribed into carrying out Putin's wishes.

As far as I can gather from the news, all that happened is that Russia exerted pressure on the Ukraine not to form a partnership with the EU, as it was about to. Then, when a revolution ousted a president who was pro-Russian, Russia annexed Crimea.

"Business lawyer Jayden Quinn speaks about how to prevent and manage the data security breaches that plague so many businesses. Tune in to the full podcast to learn how to protect yours.
As Forbes states, a business’ second most valuable asset, next to its people, is its data. How are you protecting yours?
If you think you’ll never have to worry about a data security breach, think again. It can happen whether you head up a large firm with an ironclad IT system or a small, local business.
Half of all businesses have already experienced a data security breach and cases continue to rise, yet most business leaders do not have an instant response plan in place. It’s a dangerous risk to take, as a cyber security breach could shut down your operations and have a widespread impact on your employees, customers, board members, and anyone else who’s on record of having interacted with your business.
The very thought might make you uneasy, though that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
1. Inventory your data
Inventories aren’t just for tangible goods. All businesses should inventory their data, too.
“How could you possibly understand the extent of the problem if you don’t know what information you have in the first place?” Andrew asks.
2. Develop an incident response plan
It could be a hacker that shuts down your computers or a disgruntled employee selling information to your competitors (fun fact: 22 per cent of breaches come from within a company), but if it happens—you need to know what to do, and quickly.
“You need to shut off the tap,” says Andrew.
That might mean reaching out to forensic experts or a systemwide reset, but your first job is stopping the flow of any more classified information.
The mitigation phase is where you’ll look at how you can reduce the harm to those who have been affected by the breach. For instance, if the breach involved a leak of financial information, it might mean offering free credit monitoring for a year or two.
In Canada, you’re required to report privacy breaches or data security incidents that cross a certain threshold—what is known in the legal world as real risk of significant harm. IT professionals, lawyers, and privacy regulators (find details at the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada) can help you determine what that threshold is.
Canada’s privacy law (the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA) specifies that a breach report should be made as soon as feasible, as in—as soon as you get a grip on what happened. You can and should update your reporting as more details come in.
Andrew points to the case of Ashley Madison, a Canadian dating site for those who are married or coupled. It faced a significant security breach in 2015, with user data released to the public by hackers causing significant harm to individuals families and reputation. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada did a thorough investigation and its report, Andrew says, serves as an example of what is expected in terms of protecting privacy and data security.
3. Practice your incident response plan
Your incident response plan should not be a document that sits in a drawer and collects dust. Practice it, update it, and know it well, so you’re ready to put it into action as soon as you need to.
4. Protect the data you’re entrusted with
If you’re a board member, you may be privy to confidential company information. Andrew suggests seeking resources that provide guidance for boards, such as Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI).
5. Understand the threats
Ransomware is software that essentially holds your data hostage until you pay a sum to retrieve it. Still, there’s no guarantee paying that sum will get your data back.
The best thing you can do is to have a data backup and a disaster recovery system ready so you can bring your data back immediately. With ransomware attacks expected to increase by 100 per cent in 2022, it’s important to know how to react should one happen.
6. Train staff
Andrew tells of an email he received from a regular client that read, “Here’s the report you asked for.” He hadn’t requested a report, so he responded to see if the email was legit. The client assured him it was. Andrew then forwarded the email to his company’s IT department and confirmed it was spam. Threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Andrew recommends training staff on how to identify threats, using different passwords for different applications, and picking up the phone if there’s uncertainty over an email. Two-factor authentication can weed out threats like the one Andrew experienced.",0.9523574113845825,1011,1.9825094938278198

"Vent covers play a crucial role in maintaining proper air circulation and ventilation within our homes. Over time, these covers may become damaged, outdated, or simply need to be replaced for aesthetic or functional reasons. Fortunately, replacing vent covers is a relatively simple and affordable task that can be completed by homeowners with basic DIY skills. In this essay, we will discuss the step-by-step process of replacing vent covers to ensure efficient ventilation and enhance the overall appearance of your living space.
Step 1: Gather Necessary Tools and Materials
Before starting the replacement process, gather the required tools and materials. The tools typically needed for this project include a screwdriver, measuring tape, pencil, and a level. The materials required will depend on the type of vent covers you are replacing. Common types include metal, plastic, or wooden vent covers, and the replacement covers should be of the same size and style.
Step 2: Measure the Existing Vent Covers
To ensure a seamless replacement, accurately measure the dimensions of the existing vent covers. Use a measuring tape to measure the length and width of the cover. Most vent covers are either square or rectangular, so record the measurements accordingly. This step is crucial as it will help you find the appropriate size replacement.
Step 3: Remove the Old Vent Cover
Using a screwdriver, carefully remove the screws securing the old vent cover to the wall or floor. Set the screws aside as they may be reused for the new vent cover. Gently detach the cover from the duct or opening. Take care not to damage the surrounding area during the removal process.
Step 4: Clean the Area
Once the old vent cover is removed, take the opportunity to clean the area around the vent. Remove any dust, debris, or dirt accumulated on the surface. A clean surface will ensure a smooth installation and help maintain good air quality.
Step 5: Install the New Vent Cover
Place the new vent cover over the opening and align it properly. Ensure that the cover fits securely and snugly in place. If the vent cover comes with pre-drilled holes, use these holes to guide the screw placement. If not, use a pencil to mark the screw locations through the vent cover.
Step 6: Secure the New Vent Cover
Using the screws from the old vent cover or new ones provided with the replacement, attach the new vent cover to the wall or floor. Make sure the screws are tightened securely, but avoid over-tightening, as this may cause damage to the cover or the surrounding area.
Step 7: Check for Proper Functionality
After installing the new vent cover, check for proper functionality by adjusting the airflow and observing any obstructions. Ensure that the cover opens and closes easily to control the air circulation effectively.
Replacing your vent covers is a straightforward process that can be completed with basic tools and materials. By following the step-by-step guide outlined in this essay, homeowners can maintain optimal air circulation and ventilation within their living spaces. Additionally, upgrading vent covers can be a simple yet effective way to enhance the aesthetics of a room. Remember to measure accurately, clean the area, and securely install the new vent cover to achieve the best results. With this knowledge, homeowners can easily tackle this DIY project and enjoy improved air quality and a visually appealing environment.",0.918881356716156,673,1.9337645769119263
"There is strong presumptive evidence extant tending to prove that proprietors’ meetings were held, and some measures taken towards allotting the lands in Pocock, previous to those appearing in the proprietors’ record-book. It is generally believed by authorities that, as early as 1784, John Willard, of Middlebury, Hon. Jonathan Hoyt, of St. Albans, and Captain Miles Bradley, of New Haven, at a meeting held in Canaan, Litchfield county, Conn., were appointed a committee to survey and allot the land in Pocock, though no record of such an event has been found. But deeds from the proprietors recorded in the Rutland county clerk’s office, to which county Pocock then belonged, speak of the “first division lots,” and describes them as numbered, and containing one hundred and twenty acres each. In the files of the Vermont Gazette, printed at Bennington, may also be found an article warning a meeting of the proprietors to convene “at the house of Benjamin Payn, in Addison, on the second Tuesday in May, 1788.” This warning proves that at least the third division had been made, for the fourth article reads: “To see if they [the proprietors] will proceed to lay out the fourth division, and lay roads.”
The same paper also states that, “on the second Tuesday of May, 1788, the proprietors, in pursuance of the foregoing notice, held a meeting at the time and place appointed, and chose Justin Allen, moderator, and Henry McLaughlin, clerk; and without doing any other business adjourned.”
There was also a meeting held, it appears, on the same day and at the same place, “by adjournment from Pocock,” at which one item of business brought up was, “to see if the proprietors will accept of the surveys, or divisions of land that have been made, or whether they will make surveys or divisions of land in said town; also to choose a committee for that purpose.” With reference to this it was found that “no legal” survey of a first division of land had been made, and that they proceed to make a first division of “ninety acres to each right.”
Thus it seems that the business of all previous meetings was practically annulled, and that the first division finally contained instead of one hundred and twenty acres, only ninety acres, which was really the fact. The second division contained one hundred and ten; the third, one hundred; the fourth, fifty; and fifth, twenty acres.
The first proprietors’ meeting which appears on the records met at the house of Benjamin Griswold, in Pocock, March 3, 1788, in pursuance to a warning published in the Vermont Gazette. Captain Miles Bradley was chosen moderator, and Henry McLaughlin, clerk.

"SINGAPORE, May 7, 2024 – (ACN Newswire via SeaPRwire.com) – Cordlife Group Limited (“Cordlife” or the “Company”) announced today that it has accelerated recruitment of laboratory and technical staff to ensure laboratory operational excellence as part of its strategic plan for financial year 2024 (“FY2024”) to prioritise rebuilding its foundation and strengthening core processes to prevent future disruptions.
Cordlife also provided an update that as of 30 April 2024, a significant number of affected active clients whose cord blood units were stored in Tank A has accepted the offer of a refund of annual fees from the year of the temperature excursion.
The Company will continue to store cord blood units for these clients until the maturity of their service agreements when their children turn 21, without charge. In the event a transplant physician determines that the cord blood unit cannot be successfully used for an approved cord blood transplant solely because it does not meet the viability criteria, Cordlife will make every effort to find a suitable replacement.
Cordlife has also extended the same offer to affected clients with cord blood units stored in Tank 6 and the dry shipper. The Company will be reaching out to these clients with the next steps in due course.
Cordlife has confirmed that its medical and technical teams, along with three of its Singapore-based directors – Dr Ho Choon Hou, Mr Yeo Hwee Tiong and Mr Cheong Tuck Yan Titus Jim – and Group Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ivan Yiu, have been engaging with the Ministry of Health (“MOH”) regularly to provide updates on its corrective actions to rectify the identified lapses.
Cordlife’s new sample collection in Singapore has been suspended by MOH since 15 December 2023, following checks that reported suboptimal temperatures in seven of the 22 cryogenic storage tanks based in Singapore. Checks on the remaining 15 tanks confirmed that they were not affected.
The Company emphasised that the tanks managed by its subsidiaries in markets outside Singapore remain unaffected.
As announced on 8 April 2024, cord blood units in Tank A are unlikely to be suitable for stem cell transplant purposes; units in Tank 6 and a dry shipper are deemed to be at high risk of being affected by the temperature excursions, while cord blood units in the remaining five other tanks are deemed to be at low risk (“Low-Risk Tanks”).
The Company will undertake additional testing on more cord blood units from the Low-Risk Tanks and will pause any applicable billings for clients whose cord blood units are stored there, pending the test results of each tank.
Singapore Exchange Mainboard-listed Cordlife operates Asia’s largest network of private cord blood banks with stem cell storage facilities in six markets, including Singapore. Since its inception, Cordlife has processed and stored more than 400,000 cord blood, cord lining, cord tissue and placenta stem cell samples across its stem cell storage facilities in Asia.
As part of Cordlife’s strategic plan to strengthen core processes and prevent future disruptions, it has executed or is undertaking several major rectification plans in recent weeks:
Hiring More Technical and Laboratory Staff – Cordlife has begun hiring more specialists to lead its laboratory teams more effectively. The Company has successfully recruited two additional lab directors with PhDs and implemented a retention programme to foster stability among its high-potential lab personnel in Singapore. Additionally, Cordlife continues its recruitment efforts to further enhance in-house technical expertise and improve clinical governance standards by adding more lab directors to its team.
Cordlife is also reaching out to former staff from its processing and storage facilities in other markets to support its laboratory operations in Singapore. As part of a major overhaul of processes in Singapore, the Company has commenced extensive training aimed at cultivating a stronger sense of accountability and responsibility among its staff.
Engagement of Expert Consultant from the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (“FACT” www.factglobal.org) – In its pursuit of industry excellence, Cordlife has enlisted the expertise of a consultant from FACT. This US-based expert has been guiding its technical team since December 2023 and will be on-site in mid-May to provide further guidance to the Singapore team on reinforcing core processes and on the Company’s organisational structure.
Enhanced Monitoring and Operations – Cordlife has implemented a more advanced digitalised system to enhance 24/7 real-time monitoring of its Singapore lab facility, both on-site and remotely. Additionally, the Company has also fortified fail-safe measures to ensure uninterrupted operations.
Establishment of a Distinguished Medical and Technical Advisory Board – Cordlife has been in discussions with several esteemed medical and technical experts as part of its effort to form a Medical and Technical Advisory Board for the Group. This Board aims to provide guidance and insights to the Company’s medical and technical teams. By harnessing the collective expertise of these distinguished professionals, the Company hopes to improve the quality and efficacy of its services to ensure it remains at the forefront of medical and technical innovation and excellence.
Engagement and Resolution Reached with Affected Customers – Since the lapses were identified, Cordlife has been providing updates to its clients as soon as it was in the position to do so. In February this year, Cordlife provided offers to approximately 1,800 active clients who had stored cord blood units in Tank A. Clients with units stored in Tank 6 and the dry shipper have also received information on Cordlife’s offer.
Mr Yiu said, “I sincerely apologise to all our clients and empathise with their disappointment and concerns over these lapses. We are diligently working on ways to minimise the impact on our clients.”
In response to media queries on the letter of demand from solicitors acting on behalf of one of its clients as well as the notice of a claim lodged against the Company in the Small Claims Tribunals by another client, Mr Yiu said, “Although we have sought legal advice on the claims and allegations, we want to address the issues amicably and hope that the affected clients will work with us to achieve resolution.”
Commenting on the financial impact of the MOH suspension, Mr Yiu said that Cordlife’s FY2023 performance was affected as new sample collection was suspended from December 2023. “FY2024 will be dedicated to rebuilding Cordlife’s foundation, with a focus not just on growth but also on long-term sustainability. The implementation of enhanced processes and boosting staff expertise and experience will make us stronger so we can expand to new markets and capture adjacent opportunities. We hope that this strategic advancement will elevate our position within stem cell field in the region,” he added.
“Despite the suspension, we have continued to incur fixed running costs in Singapore as we are committed to meeting our contractual obligations with our clients. Even though the suspension has continued thus far in FY2024, we are investing in more resources to improve our core processes and hire more qualified personnel. This demonstrates our unwavering commitment to our stakeholders, including our clients, MOH, business partners, staff and shareholders,” Mr Yiu said.
Cordlife also wishes to acknowledge and address the concerns raised by active clients whose service agreements are nearing maturity. Mr Yiu said, “We would like to reassure these clients that the Company will not dispose of any cord blood units belonging to them while we work towards resolution. We also kindly ask for their patience as we carefully assess our next steps, and we will contact these clients as soon as we have determined the most appropriate course of action.”

"TOKYO, Apr 24, 2024 – (JCN Newswire via SeaPRwire.com) – NEC Corporation (NEC; TSE: 6701) has expanded its “NEC cotomi” generative AI services with the development of “NEC cotomi Pro” and “NEC cotomi Light,” two new high-speed generative AI Large Language Models (LLM) featuring updated training data and architectures.
With the rapid development of generative AI in recent years, a wide range of organizations have been considering and verifying business transformation using LLMs. As specific application scenarios emerge, there is a need to provide models and formats that meet customer needs in terms of response time, business data coordination, information protection and other security aspects during implementation and operation.
NEC’s newly developed NEC cotomi Pro and NEC cotomi Light are high-speed, high-performance models that deliver the same high performance as global LLMs, but at more than ten times the speed.
Generally, to improve the performance of an LLM, a model needs to be made larger, but this slows down the operating speed. However, NEC has succeeded in improving both speed and performance with the development of an advanced new training method and architecture.
“NEC cotomi Pro” achieves performance comparable to top-level global models such as “GPT-4” and “Claude 2,” with a response time that is approximately 87% faster than GPT-4 using an infrastructure of two graphics processing units (GPU). In addition, the even faster “NEC cotomi Light” has the same level of performance as global models such as “GPT-3.5-Turbo,” but can process a large number of requests at high speed with an infrastructure of about 1 to 2 GPU, providing sufficient performance for many tasks.
Specifically, in an in-house document retrieval system using a technique called RAG, the system achieved a correct response rate higher than GPT-3.5 without fine-tuning and a correct response rate higher than GPT-4 after fine-tuning, with a response time that is approximately 93% faster.
Features of NEC cotomi Pro and NEC cotomi Light1. High throughput for various tasks
Both “NEC cotomi Pro” and “NEC cotomi Light” have high levels of processing power that are at the top level globally in terms of knowledge and ability to handle various tasks, such as document summarization, logical reasoning, and question answering.
“ELYZA Tasks 100” (top 2 graphs) and the “Japanese MT-Bench” (bottom graph) benchmark comparisons
Specifically, NEC confirmed top-level performance, not only in Japan but also globally, in two benchmarks commonly used to measure overall LLM performance: “ELYZA Tasks 100” and “Japanese MT-Bench.” NEC cotomi Pro provided results more than five times faster than GPT-4 (*) on a standard server with two GPUs. Moreover, it outperformed the speed of models such as “Gemini 1.0 Pro” and showed performance that is comparable to Claude 2 and GPT-4. At the same time, “NEC cotomi Light” provided results that are more than 15 times faster than GPT-4 while outperforming large models such as “LLaMA2-70B” and demonstrating performance that is comparable to GPT-3.5-Turbo.
2. High speed
In addition to high performance during inference, the time (speed) between sending a request and receiving a response is also important for the practical application of LLM. NEC cotomi Pro and NEC cotomi Light have achieved high speed processing that is 87% to 93% faster than GPT-4 with two standard GPUs. This has been accomplished thanks to architectural innovations that have enhanced both performance and speed, as well as a large Japanese dictionary (for tokenization) in the model. These innovations not only increase the speed of inference, but also increase the number of simultaneous accesses and reduce the training time required for fine-tuning. Moreover, additional speed improvements can be made by increasing the number of GPUs to 4 or 8, allowing for flexible construction to meet the needs of each application.
By utilizing a model that achieves high processing power with high speed and mass access, it is possible to significantly shorten the response time of business applications that utilize generative AI and improve user experience. In addition, high processing power can significantly improve performance after fine-tuning of individual data for each company.Going forward, NEC will continue to strengthen cooperation with partners and provide safe, secure and reliable AI services based on the expanded NEC cotomi lineup, with the goal of helping customers to solve a wide range of complex challenges.

"The night view of the Beijing-based China Central Television Building Photo: VGC
China Central Television (CCTV) Channel 7 will refocus its coverage entirely on navy affairs to make bigger countrywide protection publicity and schooling. Currently, the channel focuses on each army and agricultural reporting.
From August 1, the CCTV-7 Military and Agricultural Channel become the CCTV-7 National Defense and Military Channel. An insider at CCTV instructed the Global Times that the Chinese countrywide broadcaster is setting up an agricultural and rural channel.
Agricultural and rural information might be moved to a new channel, reportedly CCTV-17, a couple of media resources quoted resources as confirming. Chinese specialists stated that a specialized national army TV channel featuring countrywide protection and the army is vital.
There are now fewer brilliant army applications. Their rankings have declined in the latest years compared with entertainment applications. Zhang Zhaozhong, a military commentator active in many military applications, stated in an interview with the news portal mil.Ifeng.Com.
Zhang stated that producing a wide range of high-degree programs is vital to attract more youthful audiences. “If younger human beings now do not care about cutting-edge affairs, politics, and countrywide protection and military affairs, which will shield China inside the future?” he was quoted as pronouncing.
During these 12 months’ two classes, China’s pinnacle legislative and political consultative meetings, constructing robust countrywide protection, and strengthening schooling become a major navy situation. They are known for a lively defense education for all citizens, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Daily.
Representatives of the militia put forward many guidelines, together with national defense training in the school coaching plan and standardizing juvenile military academies to enhance the military carrier’s reserve system.
“Education in national defense and patriotism is the obligation of all Chinese. All media should guide the national defense and patriotic Education without hesitation,” Zhang stated. Zhang is known for his contentious comments that frequently go viral while he appears on TV.
‘Farming and War’
CCTV-7 has been domestic to military and agricultural applications since 1995 and is jokingly known as the “Farming and War Channel” by Chinese netizens. It even spawned a shaggy dog story that claims that a foreign spy who watches CCTV-7 will, in the end, emerge as a pig farmer.
Why were farming and military subject matters positioned on the same channel? Chinese netizens have their understanding.
Since ancient instances, countrywide protection and agriculture have been the two essential bases of China’s development and construction. Some surmise that it’s miles due to the fact the PLA received battles within and beyond with pressure from various farmers, a method called “millet and rifle.” Thus, it made sense to organize the two subject matters together on one channel to continue a tradition.
Also, soldiers in a few regions in China’s records, including the Production and Construction Corps in Xinjiang, undertook the dual challenge of guarding border areas and reclaiming desolate tracts for agricultural use.
CCTV has installed correspondent stations within the military commands in Tibet and Xinjiang self-reliant regions and within the PLA Navy and Air Force divisions.
Since 2018, the PLA army, military, air force, rocket pressure, and other army services have held open day activities for the general public, specifically young people, to beautify publicity and schooling about countrywide defense.
Many local governments connect awesome significance to strengthening young people’s health and have brought content material in primary and secondary college textbooks that can show the combating spirit of the PLA.
According to the Xinhua News Agency, an intensive task within the discipline of national protection schooling to build 10 countrywide defense education theme parks and squares, a hundred themed streets, and 1,000 themed bus stops is underway, which intends to combine national protection factors into human beings’ lives and young people Education.",0.9472266435623169,823,1.1479235887527466
"This week, Teen Vogue promoted a column with a health practitioner’s aid calling to legalize sex paintings. This could normally go unremarked upon — similar arguments appear throughout the media panorama. However, even in the Democratic presidential marketing campaign, her characterization of prostitution to the magazine’s younger readers as a trifling career desire is as valid as another.
Nestled among youngster-pleasant fluff pieces on style recommendations and movie star tidbits, the column, in comparison, promotes your body for cash to the practice of drugs — simply some other profession, merely every other preference. Supporting prostitution is “the litmus test for intersectional feminism.” “When you think about it,” the author asks, “Aren’t I a sex worker? And in a few methods, are not we all?”
Teen Vogue is a contemporary example of a fashion that treats intercourse paintings as a legitimate profession to be marketed to younger ladies. In Stockton, California, an excessive faculty newspaper these days triggered a stir by printing a positive profile on a senior who makes money via performing in pornography. The lady says she is estranged from her parents and brief on coins, but perhaps such “opportunities” will soon be a part of career counseling.
Good sexual choices require true judgment.
And given how many humans in our tradition communicate approximately intercourse, it’s hard to argue the alternative. If consent is our only moral lodestar, and all consensual sexual interest is ideal, healthful exploration, then by way of what standard have to we say that an 18-12 months-vintage female shouldn’t make a clean buck by consenting to have her frame be used for the night? Saying so could be that most despised of developments — judgmental.
But it’s a judgment we’ve misplaced as a society; the best decision is to decide proper sexual selection from the bad. Consent can inform us when intercourse is criminal (from time to time). However, it can not tell us whether it is good. Social science tells us that informal intercourse, not its formalization as a “career,” is bad for girls and ladies — and to a slightly lesser extent, guys and boys — emotional, nicely-being, and mental fitness.
In its precis of hook-up tradition, the American Psychological Association stated a study that located seventy-eight % of girls and seventy-two % of guys who had an uncommitted sexual encounter skilled feelings of regret. Multiple studies have discovered an affiliation between informal sexual meetings and signs of negative mental health, like melancholy, suicidal ideation, and drug use. As Caitlin Flanagan rightly asks in The Atlantic, “when did we lose the ability to interpret the signs and symptoms of a lady in the awful problem?”
Undermining human trafficking sufferers
Many sexual people don’t even get the chance to consent meaningfully. As the readers of Teen Vogue, many sufferers of trafficking are minors. According to the United Nations, at least 28% of international trafficking sufferers are youngsters, and the full-size majority of all human trafficking sufferers normally are ladies and girls. Among the ones trafficked inside the United States, the Department of Justice puts the percentage of victims 17 years old or younger at fifty-four %, and almost 95% of intercourse-trafficked victims are female.
These aren’t “real paintings.” It’s miles of modern-day-day slavery. The empowered “real work” imagined by Teen Vogue means nothing to each day’s miseries of those ladies.
In truth, instead of standing up for these trafficked women, Teen Vogue has published articles demanding the adverse effect of prison protections on their personal intercourse work. Their priority seems to be constantly wanting the fullest range of sexual expression for adults instead of spotting its influences on ladies’ nicely-being.
The irony is that in the intervening time, a magazine geared toward teens chose to present intercourse work in a high-quality light to teens; younger ladies are searching for the greatest armor of professional opportunities earlier than them in human history. Female unemployment is at its lowest ebb because the 1950s and the gig economic system make it possible for women to balance the needs of family and career — a balance ladies say they need — extra creatively than inside the beyond.
It’s high-quality to have a dialogue amongst residents and residents about whether prostitution could mitigate some of its many harms, mainly to the ladies and girls who input the career out of desperation or with no preference. But we don’t need to present promoting sex as a valid professional preference inside the pages of a fashion magazine for young ladies to have that discussion.",0.9440272450447083,988,1.7935532331466675
"ACLS Certification is required by health care providers working in acute care settings and also by providers of emergency services.
The majority of hospitals and emergency services within the United States require that this certification be obtained through the American Heart Association (AHA).
Don’t be fooled by Non-AHA imitations.
There are a number of ways to obtain AHA approved ACLS certification. Below is a breakdown of what is required and how it can be obtained. Also included are some cautions about online certification.
Attend a local class
- The safest way to obtain AHA ACLS certification is by attending a class in your local area. Many hospitals provide the course at a discount to their employees. You can also check your yellow pages for education facilities that provide BLS, ACLS, and first aid training. The cost of the class usually ranges from $ 150-200.
Ask your education department about opportunities for fee reimbursement or fee assistance. - When looking for a course in your local area, you should make sure to ask if the certification is AHA approved since nearly all hospitals and emergency services in the United States require AHA approved ACLS certification.
AHA approved certification always requires a written exam and hands-on skills station test.
- You should be very cautious about online ACLS certification. There are quite a number of websites that offer “ACLS Certification” but are not AHA approved. Some may even say “approved by AHA certified physicians” or “AHA physicians recommend this course”. Beware of these sites. Most hospitals and healthcare facilities will not recognize these certifications.
- There are several online courses that are AHA approved and they will say so right upfront. They want you to know they are approved and they will always make that clear.
- AHA does offer an online course or CD called “HeartCode ACLS Part 1.” If
This is the American Heart Association’s self-directed learning program. The cost of Part 1 is $120 and includes CME/CE credits. To complete the AHA ACLS certification, there are two parts to the program. Part 1 is the online or CD-based learning component that allows users to work through the ACLS curriculum at their own pace. Part 2 is the hands-on skills evaluation session usually costs around $50.
ACLS certification is a great way to expand your knowledge base as a health care professional, and it will help prepare you to be ready to perform advanced resuscitation in the healthcare setting. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.

"Fine-particle water and pH in the southeastern United States
Abstract. Particle water and pH are predicted using meteorological observations (relative humidity (RH), temperature (T)), gas/particle composition, and thermodynamic modeling (ISORROPIA-II). A comprehensive uncertainty analysis is included, and the model is validated. We investigate mass concentrations of particle water and related particle pH for ambient fine-mode aerosols sampled in a relatively remote Alabama forest during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) in summer and at various sites in the southeastern US during different seasons, as part of the Southeastern Center for Air Pollution and Epidemiology (SCAPE) study. Particle water and pH are closely linked; pH is a measure of the particle H+ aqueous concentration and depends on both the presence of ions and amount of particle liquid water. Levels of particle water, in turn, are determined through water uptake by both the ionic species and organic compounds. Thermodynamic calculations based on measured ion concentrations can predict both pH and liquid water but may be biased since contributions of organic species to liquid water are not considered. In this study, contributions of both the inorganic and organic fractions to aerosol liquid water were considered, and predictions were in good agreement with measured liquid water based on differences in ambient and dry light scattering coefficients (prediction vs. measurement: slope = 0.91, intercept = 0.5 μg m−3, R2 = 0.75). ISORROPIA-II predictions were confirmed by good agreement between predicted and measured ammonia concentrations (slope = 1.07, intercept = −0.12 μg m−3, R2 = 0.76). Based on this study, organic species on average contributed 35% to the total water, with a substantially higher contribution (50%) at night. However, not including contributions of organic water had a minor effect on pH (changes pH by 0.15 to 0.23 units), suggesting that predicted pH without consideration of organic water could be sufficient for the purposes of aqueous secondary organic aerosol (SOA) chemistry. The mean pH predicted in the Alabama forest (SOAS) was 0.94 ± 0.59 (median 0.93). pH diurnal trends followed liquid water and were driven mainly by variability in RH; during SOAS nighttime pH was near 1.5, while daytime pH was near 0.5. pH ranged from 0.5 to 2 in summer and 1 to 3 in the winter at other sites. The systematically low pH levels in the southeast may have important ramifications, such as significantly influencing acid-catalyzed reactions, gas–aerosol partitioning, and mobilization of redox metals and minerals. Particle ion balances or molar ratios, often used to infer pH, do not consider the dissociation state of individual ions or particle liquid water levels and do not correlate with particle pH.",0.9465524554252625,597,2.404874086380005

Second of all, he went down a 2nd diss in the evening, “Taylor Made Freestyle,” in which he utilized AI to have Lamar’s idolizers, 2Pac and Snoop Dogg, prompt him to react. Last but not least, he texted DJ Akademiks, that took time out from his real-time stream response to the 2nd diss to share a message with the globe. The message? Drake desires smoke with Lamar, and he desires it currently.
DJ Akademiks, that was tested on “Press Ups,” has actually frequently shared Drake’s beliefs with his followers. His love of the Toronto super star can be a little much for causal followers, yet he does have a strong background of passing on exact details regarding him.

The week began with discharges– concerning 10% of its greater than 140,000-person labor force– and chief executive officer Elon Musk stating he was going “balls to the wall” on freedom. It finished with a Cybertruck recall. Great amazing.

A little bird
While a lot of our emphasis gets on start-ups and Silicon Valley, we do have some little birds in Washington, D.C.
A little bird informed us lately that government regulatory authorities are obtaining near releasing a Notification of Proposed Rulemaking on self-governing automobile guidelines, which would certainly be the initial collection of government guardrails recommended for the market.
Our resource stated the Federal Electric motor Provider Security Administration (FMCSA), which controls business cars in the united state, must have a proposition out by this summertime, autumn at the most up to date. We’re informed that the government judgment on AVs will likely develop a minimal safety and security criterion for AVs to operate public roadways however that state federal governments can implement more stringent guidelines within their very own boundaries. We have actually been reading about conversations and strategies around government AV guidelines for several years currently. Have we ultimately began to gain ground? We will see.

Offer of the week
Serve Robotics, the Nvidia- and Uber-backed pathway robotic shipment business, hit the public markets today through a reverse merging. Offer anticipates its public launching to generate around $40 million in gross profits, moneying that will certainly approach R&D for future robotics, production of brand-new robotics, geographical growth and even more.
Serve’s objective is to raise its fleet from the 100 robotics released today around Los Angeles to 2,000 robotics throughout several united state cities by the end of 2025, through a collaboration with Uber Consumes. Offer has significant income aspirations, with strategies to produce in between $60 million and $80 million in yearly income by that exact same due date. In 2023, Offer generated $207,545 in income muddle-headed of $1.5 million.
FWIW, Uber and Nvidia are still investors, however their shares in the business are reducing with this launching. Pre-IPO, Uber and Nvidia held a 16.6% risk and 14.3% risk, specifically. As soon as the offering shuts, those risks will certainly alter to 11.5% and 10.1%, per regulatory filings.
Serve’s share cost was $4 at market open on Thursday, and it shut that day at around $3.
Various other bargains that obtained my interest …
Found Energy, a start-up that utilizes waste light weight aluminum to produce warm and hydrogen, elevated a $12 million seed round, however Tim De Chant’s story on the business has to do with a lot even more.
Getir, a Turkish shipment business that was when worth $12 billion, is reportedly considering possession sales and departures from non-core markets as financiers placed the stress on to reduce losses.
Swtch Energy, a business structure EV billing services for apartment, elevated $27.2 million in a Collection B to broaden its billing network and enhance the technology behind its billing and power administration services. Blue Planet Resources led the round with involvement from Alantra’s Power Shift Fund Klima, Energetic Influence Investments and GIGA Investments Corp.
Notable checks out and various other tidbits
Mobileye has safeguarded orders to deliver 46 countless its EyeQ6 Light ADAS chips over the following couple of years to car manufacturers. Several versions releasing this year will certainly include the chip, which guarantees to provide enhanced noticing of damp roadways, discovery of and response to items at a higher range, and far better capability to review vital message expressions on roadway indicators. TechCrunch had the possibility to go into this, and our primary takeaways are that car manufacturers will most likely like this chip since it’s a lot more effective than Mobileye’s last chip, however it coincides cost.
Waymo has actually started preliminary information collection and mapping in Atlanta, the business’s most current geographical win. The Alphabet-owned business really did not state whether it prepares to release in the Georgian city or any type of various other city it is mapping in, such as Washington, D.C., and Buffalo. Apart From San Francisco, Waymo has actually introduced business robotaxi solutions in Los Angeles and Phoenix Az, with Austin prepared for completion of this year.
Yet with ups, come downs. 6 Waymo cars likewise obtained captured blocking traffic to an on-ramp in San Francisco. The cars were captured in between a building and construction area and the on-ramp and needed to draw over to wait for rescue. A speaker informed TechCrunch that while Waymo does have the thumbs-up to go totally driverless on highways in San Francisco, the business has not yet drew the chauffeur out.
Electric cars, billing & & batteries
General Motors introduced a home EV battery charger and vehicle-to-home (V2H) package that allows a home pull power from an EV battery in case of a power outage. Consumers in The Golden State, Florida, Texas, Michigan and New york city can buy today.
Gogoro, the two-wheeler battery-swapping business, and TSMC, an international semiconductor business, are partnering to present 15 GoStations throughout Taiwan that utilize 100% tidy power. They’ll likewise be releasing Gogoro’s scooter-sharing solution in TSMC’s headquarter city, Hsinchu, and broadening the billing network in the city.
We have actually been throughout Tesla today, so allow’s dive in.
The week began with company-wide layoffs that impacted at the very least 10% of the whole 140,000-person company, with some groups seeing 20% of their team gutted. 2 prominent execs left Tesla also: Drew Baglino, Tesla’s SVP of Powertrain and Power, and Rohan Patel, VP of Public Law and Company Advancement. Patel informed TechCrunch he left as a result of “[b]ig general modifications” at the business that he decreased to define. In an e-mail sent out to the business, chief executive officer Elon Musk stated the cuts were required to raise efficiency and get ready for Tesla’s “following stage of development.”
( Psssst! Do not intend to check out Tesla discharges and what follows? You can watch about it instead.)
Many of those that were reduced, resources state, were high performers that simply occurred to be working with lower-priority jobs. Resources at Tesla likewise informed TechCrunch the business made it since it anticipates inadequate first-quarter incomes. Distributions were substandard, and all those cost cuts in 2015 that proceeded early right into 2024 most likely had a result on Tesla’s margins. Distributions were down in Q1 year-over-year, regardless of the $200,000 Tesla invested in marketing on X, per our reporting.
Which may be why Tesla ditched its EV inventory price discounts today. On X, Musk stated this step remained in line with Tesla’s method to “simplify the entire Tesla sales and shipment system.”
These modifications generally, and the discharges particularly, are made a lot more plain by Tesla’s proxy declaration that gets in touch with the board to renew Musk’s $56 billion payment, which a Delaware court previously this year invalidated. In a huff, Musk intimidated to reincorporate Tesla in Texas rather, and it shows up that strategy will certainly likewise be propounded the board quickly.
On the other hand, on the billing front, Tesla is moving forward with its strategy to construct an electrical eighteen-wheeler billing hallway extending from Texas to The golden state, regardless of being snubbed by a rewarding government financing program that becomes part of Biden’s Bipartisan Framework legislation.
Tesla today likewise needed to recall the 3,878 Cybertrucks that it has actually supplied to clients to day over defective accelerator pedals that can obtain stuck. I understand what you’re believing. Ultimately we understand the number of Cybertrucks Tesla supplied.
I have actually remained in a handful of brand-new cars and I aspire to share my ideas, however we’re likewise lacking room today. In the coming problems, we’ll have some handles electrical bikes, the 2024 Lexus LC 500h, the 2024 Mercedes-Benz eSprinter and a lot more.
See y’ all following week!",0.9487902522087097,2043,1.2101073265075684
"YouTube ads in Safari: you see them now, will you see them in the future?
Lately, we've been receiving an increasing amount of complaints about missed YouTube ads on iOS. What's important, the complaints were specifically about watching YouTube inside the Safari browser. As it turned out, YT has employed a new algorithm for showing ads to authorized users, and it had a negative effect on ad blocking quality. De facto, right now YouTube loads ad clips almost the same way as regular videos.
We found a solution that works for Safari on iOS, but it leaves much to be desired compared to other platforms and browsers. Simply speaking, we're blocking short videos (99.99% of them are ads).
UPDATE: turns out, there's a better way! Learn how to block YouTube ads in Safari on iOS from our fresh article.
But with such approach user experience takes a real hit: either there's a noticeable delay before the video loads or there's a placeholder in place of the video ad:
A few months ago YouTube started using the same way to show video ads to Chrome users, but we were able to handle it without much trouble. What's different about Safari? Unfortunately, Safari Content Blocking is severely limited compared to full-scale content blockers for other browsers. There were not many changes to Safari Content Blocking API since it was introduced in 2015.
Depending on your OS, here's what you can expect:
- iOS/iPadOS: the current solution is the best solution that can be provided right now under the circumstances. We'll have to live with it unless Apple makes drastic changes (more on that later)
- On macOS:
- If you're using the standalone AdGuard for Mac app, you're not affected at all. You probably haven't noticed these ads in the first place.
- If you're using AdGuard for Safari, make sure that ""Advanced Blocking"" extension is enabled. This extension makes up for some of the functionality that Safari Content Blocking misses. Unfortunately, it cannot be ported to iOS/iPadOS.
If Safari wants to stay relevant in terms of content blocking, some things need to be improved. We are ready to help and provide whatever expertise that might be needed. In fact, we have submitted multiple bug reports and feature requests for the last years.
Now, if you want to learn what's exactly wrong with Safari Content Blocking, read further. This may require some technical background so if you don't have it, feel free to scroll down to the last chapter.
How Safari content blocking works
Before talking about the limitations of Safari and how we at AdGuard mitigate them, it would be better to first learn how Safari Content Blocking works in the first place.
Content Blocker is basically an extension of your app that runs in a separate process, and the only purpose of this extension is to serve a JSON
file with the list of content blocking rules. These rules are then used by Safari to actually do the 'blocking' part of the job.
This diagram illustrates how content blockers work in Safari
Each content blocking rule is a JSON
object that consists of 2 parts: ""trigger"" and ""action"".
The ""trigger"" part defines what requests the rule should be applied to. And the ""action"" part, as the name suggests, defines what exactly will be done to this matching request.
What a blocking rule looks like in Safari
There are also cosmetic rules that hide page elements matching the specified CSS selector:
Cosmetic rule in Safari
We have only reviewed 2 types of actions: ""blocking a request"" or ""hiding an element"", but there are a few more:
- One that allows disabling other matching rules
- One for blocking cookies
- Another one for upgrading connection to HTTPS
Now that we know what Safari Content Blocking is and how it works, let's talk about its limitations.
Here's a short list of limitations that bothers us (as ad blocking community) the most. Some of them can be mitigated to an extent, but we're still talking about workarounds and not proper solutions.
- No debugging tools
- Different syntax (can be partially solved)
- Slow compilation
- 50k rules per content blocker limit (huge pain, but we learned to live with it)
- Limited regular expressions support
- Content Blocking is a low priority for Safari team
Let's analyze each of these problems.
No debugging tools
We'll kick things off with something that's simple yet has no solutions. To create effective filtering rules, developers need to debug them, and that requires debugging tools. Now, Safari content blocking comes with no debugging tools. The only tool that is of any help for filter maintainers is the browser Console, where they can see which requests were blocked. It's impossible to understand which rule is blocking this or that request and figuring it out may be a very tiresome process. There's also no suitable way of debugging cosmetic rules.
Browser console in Safari
This makes developing filters for Safari a very ineffective process, and many filters maintainers prioritize other browsers over Safari when it’s possible when it comes to creating a filtering rule. This, in turn, leads to poor quality of Safari filter lists compared to other browsers.
AdGuard filters, EasyList and uBlock filters are all based on the original Adblock Plus core syntax. It was extended, but the ""core"" part of it is the same among all popular content blockers.
Common filtering rule anatomy
And as you saw on the previous illustrations, Safari blocking rules have nothing in common with this syntax. And this is a problem because we don't want to create special ""Safari-only"" filter lists. It's not about us being lazy: Safari just does not provide good enough tools for developing these kind of lists.
What we want is using the good old traditional filter lists like AdGuard filters and EasyList.
The obvious solution is to automatically convert our rules into Safari content blocking rules. AdGuard does exactly that in real time right on your device.
Possible solution for Safari syntax issues
You can imagine that it's extra work that doesn't make ad blockers more efficient.
Safari compiles every content blocker JSON
into a ""prefix tree"" that speeds up the lookups.
But compiling this prefix tree is slow. For example, you can see the output from the profiler, it takes over two seconds on a new MacBook Pro to compile a JSON
with just a little over 30k rules (a vrey realistic size for a filter).
Compilation times in Safari
And this is slow. Compare it to content blockers on other platforms: it takes less than a second for AdGuard for Android app to parse and compile a list with over 100k rules. The obvious difference, though is that our Android app uses different syntax that is not as complicated as regular expressions, maybe not that flexible, but it is optimized specifically for matching URLs.
Users don't see any of this and they are not directly affected, but this aspect is actually pretty massive because it is the choke point that causes other limitations.
50k rules limit
Now that we know that the compilation is quite slow, it is easy understand the next limitation. A single content blocker cannot contain more than 50,000 rules, and this is a hard-coded limit for Safari. Apple developers confirmed that the main reason for this limitation is how slow the compilation is. They may increase the limit a little bit because new devices are faster, but this will not magically solve all problems.
There is no room for substantial improvement as long as the rules are based on using regular expressions. And don't let a seemingly high number trick you: for instance, AdGuard Base filter + EasyList have 100,000 rules in total, and that's only two filters. It's not uncommon for users on other platforms to have 5-10 filters simultaneously and even more.
In fact, there's a complex of solutions. Sadly, even when combined, they all don't provide the desired result. However, they aren't worth nothing.
As filter developers, we try to optimize our filters specifically for Safari. One of the things we do is combine similar element-hiding rules into a single one. As you can see in this example, five different rules are combined in just two:
Filter optimization in Safari
This helps a lot, but it’s still not enough.
Removing obsolete rules
Another thing we do is remove obsolete and rarely used rules from these optimized versions of filters. Thanks to those AdGuard Browser Extension users who volunteer to share anonymous filter usage statistics (this is disabled by default), we know which rules are used less heavily than the rest. We build special versions of the popular lists (like AdGuard Base filter) without obsolete and rarely used rules.
Filters maintainers can use special ""hints"" to control what rules should be kept despite the ""optimization"" process
Yes, it makes filters smaller, but in the end, the cost is lower ad blocking quality. Also, this method is not bulletproof: some rules we just don't have the stats on because they are not used in the browser extension, some filter developers will not put such hints next to their rules, etc.
Multiple content blockers
One more workaround that almost all developers of Safari ad blockers resort to is to divide the ad blocker into several independent content blockers.
AdGuard for iOS consists of 6 content blockers
Technically, each of them has less than 50k rules, yet in total they wield much more. But in ad blocking, 50k times 6 doesn't make 300km for several reasons:
- It's not uncommon when one filter addresses rules from some other one. But with this approach different Safari content blockers are completely independent, and the rules in them cannot influence each other.
- If any filter ever has more than 50k rules, you won't be able to add it at all.
We'll still continue to cut AdGuard into pieces to fit the Safari limitations, but you can see now why it's no fun.
Low development priority
We saved this one for last, because it's quite illustrative. Here's a changelog for Safari Content Blocking API over the last 6 years:
2015 — Safari Content Blocking is implemented
2016 — Added one new feature (make-https) and a couple of major bugs were fixed
2017 — Added one more new feature (if-top-url) — which is almost unusable — and added content blockers to WKWebView, fixed a couple of bugs
2018 — fixed a couple of bugs, code refactoring
2019 — fixed a couple of bugs
2020 — no significant changes
It's clear that with that rate it's impossible to catch up with the newest ad insertion technologies. Something has to change. We hope that priorities of Safari developers will shift towards fixing these problems, and we're ready to provide any help that's needed.
What to do
The ad blocking community has been sounding the alarm for years. Here are just some examples of feature requests that have been filed:
This one is particularly interesting as it would help fix the problem with YouTube ads.
- Feedback on the most pressing issues by content blocking tools developers
- Feature request to allow blocking by CNAMEs
- A feature request to increase the rules limit to 300k
- A request for a better debugging tool
There are many more, these are just some of the most pressing issues. Being a part of this community, we believe that we've done more than enough to draw Apple's attention to the problem. If more assistance of any kind is required, we'd be happy to provide any help we can.
We're at the point where changes absolutely have to come. Otherwise, everyone will lose — except for ad providers.",0.9487318396568298,2440,1.414095401763916

"Homeownership is one way to grow your wealth. Most of the time property values tend to rise while you pay off the mortgage. When you pay off the principal on your home and the value rises, you gain equity in your home. This is the monetary value between the amount you owe and the possible sale price of your house.
Verify your mortgage eligibility (Dec 1st, 2024)When you have a lot of equity in your home and interest rates are low, you might consider refinancing your mortgage. Refinancing a mortgage allows you to take equity out of your home or lower your monthly payments*.
*By refinancing your existing loan, your total finance charges may be higher over the life of a loan.
How Property Value Affects Refinancing a Mortgage
If you’re considering renovating your home or paying off debts, you might consider a refinance mortgage for these expenses. You can only do this if your property value is considerably higher than the amount you owe on your home.
Verify your mortgage eligibility (Dec 1st, 2024)For example, if you bought your home 10 years ago with a $150,000 mortgage, and it’s now worth $250,000, you’d have at least $100,000 in equity. Paying your monthly mortgage may have reduced the amount of principal you owe and freed up more equity.
In this example, the increase in property value gives you access to an additional $100,000. However, if you choose to refinance the mortgage and take some of that equity, your monthly payment amount will usually increase. Depending on the type of refinance mortgage, you may find yourself beginning a 30-year mortgage again. Before opting to refinance, make sure that you can afford the future repayment schedule.
Reasons Property Values Increase
Your home might be worth more than when you bought it. There are a variety of reasons that property values increase, such as:
Verify your mortgage eligibility (Dec 1st, 2024)- Improvements to the property: From adding a new roof to remodeling the kitchen, your home has probably seen a variety of improvements. Each of these upgrades can increase the value.
- Tight housing market: There are times when there aren’t many homes available to buy. When this happens, people trying to sell their homes can ask more for them. This drives the property value up.
- Popularity of your neighborhood grows: As the population increases, people move further away from the city center. You may find that your neighborhood that once sat on the outskirts of town has grown in popularity. The increase in demand helps home prices increase.
- Time: Traditionally, the value of a home rises over time. Sometimes, it’s a slow steady increase, while at other times prices seem to skyrocket.
When the economy booms, you tend to see an increase in property values. Before you decide to refinance a mortgage, weigh your options and understand the repayment schedule.
Reasons to Refinance a Mortgage
Refinancing a mortgage requires most of the same paperwork and costs of closing on the home in the first place. This takes time and money. So why do people opt to refinance a mortgage? Reasons include:
Verify your mortgage eligibility (Dec 1st, 2024)Home Renovations
If you bought your home a decade or more ago, then your home probably isn’t in line with the latest housing trends. Many homeowners refinance their mortgages for home renovations. This might include a bonus room, new kitchen, or mother-in-law suite.
Pay Off Debts
The interest on a mortgage is typically lower than that on credit cards. If you have a large amount of debt, you might consider refinancing and using the equity in your home to pay down your debts.
Lower Your Monthly Mortgage Payments
If you bought your home when interest rates were high, refinancing your mortgage might save money, especially over the term of the loan. When interest rates fall to historic lows, many people choose to refinance and lower their payments.
Verify your mortgage eligibility (Dec 1st, 2024)Make a Large Purchase
In some cases, you might opt to refinance a mortgage to make a large purchase. It might be a new car, boat, or something else. When you can receive a lower interest rate by refinancing a mortgage instead of another type of loan, it’s beneficial to refinance a mortgage.
College Tuition for Your Kids
Sending your children to college has been your dream since they were small children. It’s also one of the most expensive experiences you’ll pay for your kids. With enough equity in your home, you can pay for your child’s college by refinancing your mortgage.
Deciding whether to refinance your mortgage is a serious decision. When interest rates are low, and your property value has risen, it’s tempting to use the equity in your home. However, you need to decide if you can afford the increase in payments over the long-term. You don’t want to end up in a tight money situation. It’s always a good idea to talk to a lender when you’re considering refinancing your mortgage.
If you are looking for help navigating the refinance process, contact our experienced team.

"As the Biden-Harris administration and 117th Congress get to work, the California Chamber of Commerce is communicating its international trade priorities and support for working together to secure a national free trade agenda to federal officials.
Those officials include the newly sworn in Secretary of Commerce, in addition to California members of Congress.
The 40th U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Gina M. Raimondo, was sworn in on March 3 after a bipartisan Senate vote of 84-15. She will lead a key agency responsible for focusing on promoting economic growth.
A graduate of Harvard University and Yale Law School, Raimondo was a venture capitalist before entering public service. Most recently, she served as Governor of Rhode Island.
The confirmation of trade lawyer Katherine Tai as U.S. Trade Representative, a Cabinet-level position within the Executive Office of the President, was pending this morning. She is a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School.
Fluent in Mandarin, Tai spent several years as the head of China enforcement at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Most recently, Tai worked in the top trade staff position on the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee.
CalChamber Trade Priorities
The CalChamber, in keeping with longstanding policy, supports expansion of international trade and investment, fair and equitable market access for California products abroad, and elimination of disincentives that impede the international competitiveness of California business.
Specifically, the CalChamber asks that:
- Trade be a priority.
- The revamp of the World Trade Organization address the functioning of the Appellate Body, and support efforts to ensure our trading partners adhere to fair and transparent trade practices while being held accountable when they violate international rules.
- The focus continue on lowering tariffs and nontariff barriers to support the expansion of American exports.
- Trade Promotion Authority is renewed to enable the United States to easily pursue new trade deals.
- Bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements — which are critical to consumers, workers, businesses, farmers and ranchers — continue to be advanced.
Trade as a Priority
California is one of the 10 largest economies in the world with a gross state product of more than $3 trillion.
International trade and investment are a major part of the economic engine for the state of California that broadly benefits businesses, communities, consumers and state government. California’s economy is more diversified than ever before, and the state’s prosperity is tied to exports and imports of both goods and services by California-based companies, to exports and imports through California’s transportation gateways, and to inflows and outflows of human and capital resources.
Accordingly, promoting the ability of California companies to compete more effectively in foreign markets continues to be a high priority for the CalChamber, along with attracting foreign business to the state.
Supporting global trade is about helping Main Street businesses. Most exporting firms in our state are small and medium-sized businesses. The jobs created in these trade-reliant sectors pay higher wages than their nontrade-related counterparts and create additional jobs in nontraded industries, such as restaurants, retail, hospitality and others.
World Trade Organization
The World Trade Organization is the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. Its main function is to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.
At its heart are the WTO agreements, negotiated and signed by the bulk of the world’s trading nations, and ratified or approved in their parliaments or legislatures. The goal is to help producers of goods and services, exporters and importers conduct business. The WTO gives U.S. and California businesses improved access to foreign markets and better rules to ensure that competition with foreign businesses is conducted fairly.
The CalChamber is pleased the major trading economies reached consensus on the Director General and now can focus on a path forward for the WTO in 2021. The revamp of the World Trade Organization should address the functioning of the Appellate Body, and support efforts to ensure our trading partners adhere to fair and transparent trade practices while being held accountable when they violate international rules.
The CalChamber opposes protectionist-oriented legislation that leads to higher prices and limited choices for consumers. The negative impact of this sort of policy often expands to include job loss in related industries, retaliation by our trade partners and violations in WTO and trade agreement provisions.
The CalChamber has supported a number of state and federal programs, but it should be noted that the CalChamber also dissuades the introduction of legislation that is unnecessary, unconstitutional or violates existing trade agreements.
Raising tariffs results in higher prices to the consumer for the specific product protected and in limited choices of products for consumers. Further, increased tariffs cause a net loss of jobs in related industries, retaliation by U.S. and California trading partners, and violate the spirit of our trade agreements.
One of the major challenges generally facing American exporters is the duty rates or tariffs and other assessments charged by other countries when goods are imported into those countries. The U.S. has the lowest average duty rate at 4.5%.
The CalChamber urges Congress to continue to support the lowering of duty rates with short phase-out periods as one means to support the expansion of American exports as free trade agreements are enacted.
The CalChamber also urges Congress to continue to support the reduction and eventual elimination of nontariff barriers, whether due to sanitary or phytosanitary certificates, lack of streamlined regulatory procedures, quotas, embargoes, assessments, and similar monetary and other challenges imposed to limit imports into the country.
Trade Promotion Authority
With more than 30% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) tied to international trade and investment and 95% of the world’s population abroad, representing 80% of the world’s purchasing power, U.S. engagement in the international marketplace is more important to the nation’s economy than ever.
Passage of trade promotion authority will help Congress and the President to work together to forge new and beneficial trade agreements for the United States.
Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has been granted the authority to negotiate market-opening trade agreements in consultation with Congress. Congress will need to renew trade promotion authority again in 2021 to enable the United States to continue aggressively pursuing new trade deals.
Without trade promotion authority, the United States will be compelled to sit on the sidelines while other countries negotiate numerous preferential trade agreements that put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage.
By approving trade promotion authority, Congress can help strategically address the range of U.S. trade negotiations being pursued: conclusion to a U.S.-United Kingdom free trade agreement; a possible U.S.-European Union free trade agreement; conclusion to a U.S.-Kenya free trade agreement; and even a possible re-admission to the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) — now Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) — as well as other future trade negotiations.
The CalChamber, therefore, supports the extension of trade promotion authority so that the President of the United States may negotiate new multilateral, sectoral and regional trade agreements, ensuring that the United States may continue to gain access to world markets, resulting in an improved economy and additional employment of Americans.
U.S. Completed Agreements
The United States has completed free trade agreements (FTAs) with Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Central America, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Oman, Panama, Peru, Singapore, South Korea, and the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
Financially, this translates into the removal of billions of dollars in tariffs for U.S. exports. Trade agreements ensure that the United States may continue to gain access to world markets, which will result in an improved economy and additional employment of Americans. The CalChamber urges support of trade agreements that will continue to keep U.S. and California businesses competitive.
Other Free Trade Agreements
Several hundred FTAs are in force worldwide, with the United States party to just a handful. For example, both Canada and Mexico have FTAs with Chile. Mexico has more than 45 FTAs with countries and blocs, including Japan, Israel and the European Union. Chile has more than 50 FTAs with countries worldwide.
Future Trade Agreements
The CalChamber has asked the administration and Congress to continue to advance bilateral, regional and multilateral trade agreements which are critical to consumers, workers, businesses, farmers and ranchers.
In addition, the United States should reinvigorate efforts to establish free trade agreements with partners that share our trade philosophy, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Japan. These markets offer new access opportunities for American products and creating these alliances would ensure the U.S. can maintain its position as a major exporter.

"The World Economy is at a crossroads on so many fronts, that it requires a different approach than what we are used to, especially in dealing with security risks.
We need a new way of thinking about security that puts more emphasis on cooperation than on alliances and on communication than on fighting. What could have happened differently regarding the crisis in Europe (Russia-Ukraine)?
The Global Security Initiative (GSI) is a plan put forward by China to move toward a new security paradigm that puts collaboration ahead of alliances and communication ahead of conflict.
The Global Security Initiative (GSI) was first proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference on April 21, 2022. The GSI is guided by “six commitments or pillars,” which are: (i) pursuing common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security; (ii) respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries; (iii) adhering to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter; (iv) taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously; (v) peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation; and (vi) maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains.
The GSI concept paper
Fast forward to February 21, 2023, when China released the GSI concept paper, which elaborates on the six pillars mentioned above and equally identifies priorities, platforms, and mechanisms of cooperation.
According to the concept paper, “the GSI aims to eliminate the root causes of international conflicts, improve global security governance, encourage joint international efforts to bring more stability and certainty to a volatile and changing era, and promote durable peace and development in the world.” Gleaning from these core principles, it’s safe to say that the GSI could and probably will become a catalyst for the world to chart a new path to building sustainable peace, stability, and development.
The six (6) key commitments of the GSI
The six (6) commitments of the GSI come from how China talks about its own security and the security of other countries.
First off, the GSI’s new objective does indeed have a global focus. China has typically focused its cautious forays into security on specific regions and stressed the need to find local solutions to local problems, even though China is already an economic power with global reach and widely perceived as a future, or even present, superpower capable of competing with US influence.
The GSI codifies the fundamental principles of contemporary Chinese foreign policy, which are enumerated in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which are mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty; mutual non-aggression; mutual non-interference in internal affairs; equality and cooperation for mutual benefit; and peaceful co-existence.
The GSI believes that everyone has a duty to take seriously the real security concerns of other countries.
Stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security.
The key word under this pillar is how the world could strive to build sustainable security.
Since 2014, China has been working on a new plan for shared, all-encompassing, cooperative, and long-term security. This vision has received widespread recognition and support from the international community.
To make security last, it will be important to keep it up in both traditional and non-traditional areas, improve security governance in a coordinated way, and respect and protect the security of every country.
- Stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries.
It goes without saying that if you don’t find it exciting for another country to meddle in your territorial affairs, then what gives you the right to do so when it comes to other countries?
According to the GSI, “all countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international community.” Their internal affairs brook no external interference; their sovereignty and dignity must be respected, and their right to independently choose social systems and development paths must be upheld.”
- Stay committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.
It’s safe to say that the UN Charter is the institutional foundation for world peace and security.
All nations should reject any attempt to undermine its successful implementation because it is totally unjustified.
True multilateralism must be practiced by all nations, and they must strongly support the international order with the UN at its center.
- Stay committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously. Humanity is an indivisible security community.
As profoundly stated, “the security of one country should not come at the expense of that of others”.
This is very fundamental if we seek to secure lasting peace in our world. All nations’ valid and reasonable security concerns should be taken seriously and addressed appropriately, not routinely disregarded or undermined.
- Stay committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation.
There needs to be a new way of solving problems, and as has become clear, this new way does not involve sanctions and military confrontations.
Dialogue and consultations are a key tenet of this commitment to the peaceful settlement of crises and encourage conflicting parties to build trust, and settle disputes.
- Stay committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains.
If there were a way to monitor the existential threats to international security, such as terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity, pandemics, etc., it would only be reasonable to advise nations to adhere to the global governance principles of comprehensive consultation, collaborative participation, and shared benefits and cooperate to resolve international issues and regional conflicts.
GSI in Practice – Saudi Arabia & Iran Deal
“Name me a world leader who’d change places with Xi Jinping.” This was a direct quote from a speech made by American President, Joe Biden during the State of the Union Address in February 2023.
It’s fair to assume that the president will be happy to switch places with President Xi Jinping now, judging from the historic deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran brokered by China.
Putting aside the geopolitical nuances, this is a typical GSI in practice by China and sets the stage for a new and more effective alternative to resolving conflicts around the world.
The deal reached between Saudi Arabia and Iran encompasses all six commitments, which are the core principles of the GSI.
The two countries are set to resume diplomatic ties and reopen embassies and missions within two months after seven years of no diplomatic ties.
No arms were raised, and no sanctions were imposed, but only dialogues and extensive consultations. A peaceful Middle East is a peaceful world for all.
Our world is anything but peaceful: major country competition is heating up, geopolitical conflicts are getting worse, changes not seen in a century are happening quickly, the global security governance system is woefully behind, and new traditional and unconventional security threats are constantly emerging.
China’s Global Security Initiative could become the catalyst for building and shaping a prosperous and peaceful global future. The GSI suggests that all countries’ legitimate security concerns should be taken seriously, that the goals and principles of the UN Charter should be followed, that all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected, and that disagreements and disputes between countries should be solved peacefully. The vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security provides conceptual guidance.

"Last Updated on January 30, 2023 by a Friendly Gardener
Peperomia is a beautiful, easy-to-care-for houseplant that is the perfect choice for beginners, home gardeners with little time, or those who travel frequently. But my peperomia is drooping, why?
Despite its ease of care, it can occasionally suffer some problems and one of the most common is drooping. Let’s examine why peperomia plants droop and how to fix your plant.
A Droopy Peperomia
The most common causes for droopy peperomia are underwatering and dehydration although substantially low humidity levels can contribute. However, these aren’t the only reasons. Other causes may include extreme environmental temperatures, the onslaught of root rot, or an infestation by pests. All these problems can be resolved if caught early and treated. Here’s what to watch for and how to aid your plant in recovery.
What Causes Peperomia Leaves Drooping?
Consider that a healthy peperomia will feature strong, firm stems and foliage. The plant will grow upright with leaves that do not bend. If your plant has soft, flexible stems and leaves and the plant sags, you have droopy peperomia.
The most common causes of droopy peperomia include
- Lack of humidity
- Improper environmental temperatures
- Improper fertilization
- Pest infestations
- Repotting trauma
- Dusty foliage
Overwatering is the primary cause of fatality for houseplants. If the plant’s stems appear floppy and soggy or mushy and of course wilt, your plant is most probably overwatered. Yellow leaves are also indicative of overwatering as is a peperomia dropping healthy leaves.
To aid in preventing overwatering, use a soil mix that is loose and guarantees excellent drainage and soil aeration. If the soil bed retains excess water, the root system will be deprived of oxygen and your plant will suffocate. Root rot will take hold and roots will be unable to furnish nutrients. Your plant will begin to droop and if left untreated will die.
If the plant already appears mushy, you need to repot it. Remove the plant, rinse off the root system with tepid water and trim off all compromised unhealthy roots. Repot your plant in fresh soil in a pot with a good number of drainage holes. Water thoroughly and permit the excess water to drain. After, water approximately every ten days.
This is usually the most common cause of peperomia leaves drooping. A peperomia will store water in the foliage so that they feel firm to the touch. Remember that plants transpire, so they will always be emitting some amount of vapor. If leaves do not contain enough water, they will show that they are stressed. When a peperomia is dehydrated, it will have difficulty standing upright. The plant will no longer be firm and will sag. Leaves droop and the edges and tips can turn brown. While this is not a houseplant that seeks constant moisture, it also cannot be left bone dry.
When the soil is dry approximately an inch to two deep, it’s time for watering. This will generally occur every one to three weeks depending on the plant’s environment.
Lack of Humidity
Generally, peperomia thrives in normal household humidity, but if you have a dryer climate, your plant can suffer. Humidity levels generally drop indoors in the winter due to heating and occasionally in the summer if air conditioning is frequent. When a peperomia is struggling with indoor humidity levels, it may begin to curl its leaves followed by drooping. This reduces the plant’s foliage surface to retain moisture.
As tropical plants, peperomia will enjoy higher humidity levels in its natural habitat. A hygrometer can indicate if your plants are getting sufficient humidity. Most tropical plants, including peperomias, will thrive at 50% or higher. If you need to improve humidity levels, use a space humidifier, or a pebble tray underneath your plant. Grouping plants together will also raise humidity through the creation of a microclimate. Occasional misting can help.
Improper Environmental Temperatures
Tropical peperomias like temperatures that measure between 60° and 80°F. If temps drop below 50°F your plant will be in trouble and stressed. Leaves may curl and the plant may wilt. These plants cannot handle freezing temperatures or frost. Freezing causes the formation of crystals within the plant which destroy the structure and lead to death.
Extreme temps registering above 80°F will also cause plants to stress as well as direct sunlight exposure, so be careful if you take your peperomia outdoors for a spell in the summer or warmer months.
Peperomias are not heavy feeders so overfertilization is unwarranted. Exaggerated feeding will cause a buildup of salts in the soil bed that will prevent roots from absorbing adequate water. Foliage will yellow or turn brown on tips and edges due to dehydration. Drooping will follow.
If you think you have overfertilized, flush out your plant’s soil bed to remove salt buildup or repot your plant entirely in fresh soil and avoid fertilizing for several months. When you do feed, use a liquid plant fertilizer that has been diluted.
Peperomias are relatively pest-free, but if they are exposed to another plant that is infected, an infestation can follow. The more common pests that afflict houseplants include spider mites, mealybugs, or whiteflies. If you place your plant outdoors on a deck, porch, or balcony, it can be invaded by fungus gnats, thrips, or scales as well and you may see an occasional caterpillar, snail, or slug munching holes in leaves. When left untreated, you may observe peperomia leaves drooping.
Examine foliage, stems, and the soil bed surface for evidence of pests. Manually remove any that you see and consider showering your plant in tepid water to remove those you cannot see. Treat your plant with insecticidal soap or a natural pesticide like Neem oil that is non-toxic to humans and pets.
When plants are repotted, they suffer a bit of shock until they acclimatize to their new soil bed. This can cause a bit of drooping. When repotting do not leave roots exposed for too long a time. Reposition your plant in its same location or one with the same light, indoor temperature, and humidity level as before. Environmental change can contribute to your plant drooping.
Dust is not a major problem but when left to accumulate on leaves it can reduce the plant’s ability to absorb sunshine and reduce the release of gases from foliage. Shower your plant with tepid water to clean leaves occasionally or wipe foliage with a soft damp cloth.",0.925438404083252,1467,2.9273087978363037
"The Sisyphean Challenge of Team Leadership
Maybe you remember Sisyphus from mythology – the guy who had to push the boulder uphill, only to have it tumble down as he neared the top. Sometimes leading a team feels like that: we feel we’re getting somewhere, but then we hit a roadblock, if not a boulder hurtling toward us. Maintaining long-term motivation is a big challenge. It’s easy to get a group started on a complex challenge (although it often doesn’t feel like it at the time), but keeping at it can be even more daunting.

Understanding Motivation in Leadership
Our February Third Thursday, with Doug Dunston of St. Thomas University, tackled this topic. Doug began with what might be surprising: re-framing what we sometimes call “extrinsic motivation” by introducing the term amotivation. It’s what we’re experiencing when we say to ourselves “I have no idea why I’m doing this.” This shift in perspective recognizes that extrinsic motivation often isn’t really motivation at all, at least beyond a certain level of compliance. Compliance works for some tasks – but it has no ability to get a team very far on a big challenge. Sometimes we call this phenomenon being “volun-told” (which has become a meme – exercise caution when Googling).
The Pitfalls of Traditional Motivational Tactics
Is there an alternative? Doug had more bad news for us. Some of the tools we’re used to – deadlines, surveillance, evaluations, even some kinds of goals – have been found to be counter-productive (here’s an article; hunt on Google Scholar for the full version). They’re not just neutral, they actually undermine people’s intrinsic motivation to work on the challenge.
“It seems all the things that we have a tendency to try and do to get the team moving along might be destroying the efficacy of our team. So what do we do about this?”
A New Perspective on Motivation
The key to maintaining long-term motivation? Tapping into people’s basic human needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Autonomy, even in small things, is a powerful tool. It’s why we ask every team member to volunteer to do a small task in a Strategic Doing workshop. On a team level, that builds trust: everyone is in this together. On the individual level, it satisfies people’s intrinsic need for autonomy. Paying attention to what’s going on at both the individual and the team levels is critical to helping a team tackle challenges. It requires leadership when the team launches its work together, as well as over the long haul, when the boulders start rolling downhill and the team’s resilience is tested.
Practical Insights from Doug Dunston

"Aice Makes History by Earning Superbrands for Five Consecutive Years
Jakarta, November 4, 2024 – Aice Group, a leading ice cream company in Southeast Asia, once again demonstrates its commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) by receiving the prestigious TOP CSR Awards 2024 from Top Business Magazine. This award is concrete proof of Aice's dedication to developing innovative, sustainable CSR programs that positively impact the environment, society, and the economy.
At the 2024 TOP CSR Awards, Aice Group received two accolades: the TOP CSR Awards 2024 at the Four-Star Level, recognizing its exceptional quality, and the TOP Leader on CSR Commitment 2024, awarded to Aice Group CEO Jack Wang. These awards honor Jack Wang's strong commitment to supporting and promoting CSR program innovations and initiatives at Aice Group. This recognition is not the first, as Aice has consistently won the TOP CSR Awards since 2021, marking four consecutive years of dedication to implementing innovative and sustainable CSR programs.
Aice expressed its gratitude to all those involved in achieving this success. ""Aice Group is extremely proud to receive this award. The TOP CSR Awards 2024 is tangible evidence of Aice's dedication to continually innovating and contributing to society through various CSR programs. This award also reflects our commitment to balancing business growth with social responsibility and our efforts to create a positive, sustainable impact on the environment and community,"" said Jack Wang, CEO of Aice Group.
Innovative CSR Programs in 2023
Aice Group's success in 2024 stems from its consistent and continuous CSR efforts throughout 2023. One of its main initiatives was a collaboration with the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI), where Aice supported sports by distributing 10,000 ice creams and 500 soccer balls to various football schools (SSBs) across Indonesia. This program is part of Aice's long-term commitment to advancing national sports and building a robust sports ecosystem in Indonesia, a critical evaluation factor for the TOP CSR Awards.
In 2023, Aice also strengthened its health and happiness initiatives through the #15HariAiceBerbagiSehat (15 Days of Aice Sharing Health) program, conducted monthly since 2021. The program aims to inspire healthy lifestyles in Indonesian communities through various activities, including ice cream distribution and health campaigns. As part of this commitment, Aice built a multi-purpose field in Lombok to support students’ education and physical activities, continuing its mission to enhance education and sports.
Significant Contributions During Ramadan
During Ramadan 2023, Aice ran a program distributing millions of ice creams to tens of thousands of villages across Indonesia, covering regions like Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Bali, under the theme Festive Dessert: Village Chiefs Sharing Blessings. In the same year, Aice also collaborated with the Ministry of Youth and Sports (Kemenpora), PSSI, the Indonesia Junior League (IJL), the Indonesian Army’s Disjasad, and Foodbank of Indonesia to support this initiative, proving its commitment to consistently spreading joy and supporting sports sustainably.
Continued Support for Education, Health, and Disaster Relief
Beyond its 2023 initiatives, Aice has consistently demonstrated its commitment to education, health, and disaster relief. The company served as the Official Ice Cream Partner for the FIFA World Cup Qatar and worked with Kemenpora to educate the public about healthy living and foster enthusiasm for sports from an early age.
In previous years, Aice supported disaster victims, including providing aid to relief posts during the Palu earthquake in 2020 and West Sulawesi in 2021. It also rebuilt schools affected by the 2019 Lombok earthquake. During the early COVID-19 pandemic, Aice donated PPE and ice cream to healthcare workers at 14 COVID-19 referral hospitals and one medical rest station. Between 2020 and 2022, Aice distributed over 67 million medical masks, produced in-house and provided free through government agencies, organizations, local shop owners, and other stakeholders as part of its social assistance efforts.
Commitment to Product Quality and Sustainability
Aice Group is not only focused on business growth but is also committed to product quality and sustainability. Its factories have earned various prestigious certifications, including the HACCP Food Safety Assurance System, ISO 9001:2008 Management Certification, and an ""A"" rating in halal assurance implementation. Moreover, Aice's Mojokerto factory uses modern technology, including robotic systems, to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness, aligning with Industry 4.0 demands.
The TOP CSR Awards 2024 recognizes Aice Group's commitment to implementing innovative, sustainable CSR programs that positively impact society and the environment. Aice Group remains committed to increasing its contributions to building a better world.
At the same event, the Chairman of the TOP CSR Awards 2024, M. Lutfi Handayani, MM., MBA, stated that this year's theme was ""Innovative CSR and ESG Programs to Support Sustainable Business Growth."" CSR and ESG are expected not only to benefit society and the environment but also to align with business strategies to achieve targets for sustainable growth.
This theme encourages companies to implement ESG and CSR by adopting ISO 26000 SR and ESG standards. ""If these responsibilities are carried out, many socio-economic issues in Indonesia can be resolved independently,"" he added.
The award criteria include alignment of CSR initiatives with sustainable business growth strategies, adoption level of CSR policies and programs under ISO 26000:2010 SR, CSR governance systems, flagship CSR program innovation, and identification of ESG materiality impacts on business and their management strategies for continuous sustainable growth.
""The TOP CSR Awards 2024 reaffirms Aice's position as a company not only focused on business growth but also committed to environmental sustainability and societal welfare.

"As near as I could tell, no one had ever been killed before in a plane crash at my home airport outside suburban Chicago.
The news came in a text.
“Are you alive?” read the message from my close friend Mike.
When I get a text I tend to ignore it or just call back. This time I decided to reply with whimsy.
“As far as I know,” I typed the first reply and hit send. “Yep, just checked my pulse, I’m still here. Why?” said the second.
“Thank goodness,” he sent. “Some guy just killed his passenger at Clow. Lots of fire, it’s gruesome.”
With about 500 hours and a three-year old certificate, this was my first up close experience with the constant barrage of mayhem I read about in the six aviation magazines I subscribe to. The fact that no one knew of anyone killed at my field–opened in the late 50s–was my rabbit’s foot wrapped in four leaf clover. The bubble of safety I had envisioned around 1C5 had been popped.
Over the next few hours, I received seven similar queries. In a way it’s sweet that when there’s a plane crash–even in another state–someone I know suspects it’s me and checks in. On the other hand, I think some believe it’s just a matter of time before it happens to all of us.
The Cirrus SR20 was piloted by a doctor from Kentucky. The passenger was his wife. He died the next day.
The early news stories were consistent with the most common danger of the air: a low speed loss of control after a botched landing. The impact area in a local bank parking lot told me he was using 18.
Reflexively, I checked the weather. Seemingly benign with clear skies and 8 knots out of 070, my experience is that winds from that direction are the toughest to deal with at Clow. They tend to funnel between the big box retailers that line the east border and can be adventurous as they gust and diminish, especially near mid-field where the Home Depot meets the Lowe’s. I would not choose to land south in that quartering tailwind but if there were others going that way in the pattern I wouldn’t avoid it, either. I would get down in the first 300 feet, though.
Even more so than usual, I started counting the ways this couldn’t happen to me.
One. In the last two years I haven’t had to do a go around because of a bad approach. Anywhere between 60 and 65 knots over the fence and my forgiving 182 is a land-o-matic.
Two. While on short final at Madison, Wisconsin (MSN) recently a controller needed me to abort when a business jet came in faster than he expected on the cross runway. I can recite the procedure in my sleep: Cram (the throttle), Climb, Clean, Cool. Not trying to brag, but the execution was perfect and, at the time, I actually thought it was kind of fun.
Three and Four. I have since practiced the procedure twice in the last four months.
That should have been the end of it for me. File that one away as a close-to-home reminder of a common error easily avoided by basic technique.
It was not that easy.
The tragedy occurred while I was on the second long trip my wife and I had taken together. She is a nervous flyer stemming from a horrible experience when she was seven years old in a Piper Cub. As her father told me the story, she was caught in a sudden thunderstorm with a severe crosswind. Short on fuel, they couldn’t escape to a safer field. None of the people on the ground or the pilot thought they would get out uninjured, but they made it safely. She had nightmares for years.
She had stoically announced when my flying began that she would never accompany me. After the last two years of uneventful flying from coast to coast as an IFR rated pilot with a top class traveling machine, she had begun to relent. She was actually enjoying the experience and openly talking about the next trips we could take.
But I was ever mindful of her fear and was working very hard to not violate her trust, doing all I could to steer clear of even light turbulence, and avoiding gusty crosswinds while she was with me.
Additionally, the trip that we were on was stressful. For years we had considered moving our business and family to a warmer climate and had settled on three locations in the Carolinas as possible destinations. This trip was to visit all three and to come to a decision regarding the next stage of our life.
We both agreed the aircraft was the perfect traveling machine for this. Until it wasn’t.
The flight from Clow International (1C5) to Greenville South Carolina (GMU) was uneventful. A brisk climb through a turbulent layer at 1500 feet led to a silky smooth ride by 2500. Although there was a hazy overcast, we never lost visibility of the ground until we were well above the cloud layer near Peotone. It was simply gorgeous after that. We couldn’t see soil until southern Tennessee but the clouds were beautiful below and the sky above was as Carolina blue as it could be. I considered it an omen.
We explored Greenville and had a wonderful time. We revisited the home that we were seriously interested in and toured the beautiful downtown once again.
The plan was to go on to Charleston the next day. After a lovely breakfast and another stroll around the central area, we headed to the airport for the short one hour and 10 minute leg to Mount Pleasant airport (KLRO) outside Charleston. And that’s when our trouble began.
Trying to contact ground control I found that our radios were not working. I didn’t think of the various ways I could troubleshoot the problem: pulling the circuit breakers for the different radios, or even operating on my handheld. Three hours later the Carolina Avionics shop advised I was good to go on Com 2 with the power pulled to Com 1.
By that time we were in Charleston having made the decision to drive.
We finished up in that charming city and the next day made the 3 1/2 hour drive to Lake Norman, our final stop, just outside of Charlotte.
Exhausted after looking at homes in this beautiful area for seven hours, we got the dreaded texts as we headed for dinner that evening.
Back at the hotel, I absorbed all of the news I could find on the crash.
Most haunting was a video of an eyewitness, the manager of my son’s favorite frozen custard shop next door to the bank.
“The pilot got out and was on fire,” said the young man dressed in white. “We yelled at him to roll on the ground, but all he could do was cry to us to get his wife out of the plane. He must have said 10 times ‘Please help my wife, Please help my wife.’”
“And then the plane exploded. There was just no way.”
His voice trailed off, and my eyes filled with tears.
After a restless night with visions of fire and images of my wife trapped in the plane, I woke to a partially cloudy sky and weather forecasts for an easy return home.
I acted as if nothing was wrong and as if I had no concerns. But the crash and the nightmares were weighing heavily on my mind.
We spent the drive from Charlotte back to Greenville making long lists of the pros and cons of each area we had visited. I was completely confused, uncertain about whether or not we should move.
When we arrived at the FBO and as I was parking the car, I did something I almost never do. In parallel parking I am an expert. If the car can fit, I can get in there, usually the first try.
There was a very large space but somehow I struck the vehicle behind us.
No harm done and no damage. But it shook me even further. If I can’t parallel park, how can I fly this airplane back to my now deathly home base?
We spoke to the mechanic who had tested the radios. They found everything in order. I got out my trusty handheld which I had charged the night before, just in case.
We loaded up the airplane and taxied out to do a run up. Everything was perfect. We were ready to go home.
After a nearly 10 minute wait for a clearance my anxiety continued to build, the kind of free-floating nervousness with no obvious root cause. I had no reason to be anxious, just an overall unsettled feeling. I started to think to myself whether this unusually long ATC delay was a sign that perhaps we should spend another night.
But in looking for a reason to stay I couldn’t find one. Suddenly I needed to visit the men’s room and that’s just when we got the clearance.
Knowing that I would be fine once we got in flight and the cold collywobbles in my stomach settled down, we powered up to full throttle. Gauges were in the green, the engine sounded great. Air speed came alive just as always.
During this trip before the bad news, I had been reading a book about flying technique. One of the things it had stressed was a pilot should fly the POH, especially the rotation numbers and speeds on departure. My previous practice had been to allow the airplane to tell me when it was ready to go by a feeling of lightness. Generally that was between 60 and 65 knots depending on the weight in the aircraft and other mysterious variables that I can’t quantify.
The rotation speed (Vr) in a Cessna 182 Turbo retractable is 55 knots. That always seemed slow to me and I had never before rotated at such a pace. But the writing was from a pilot I trusted and so as the airspeed indicator displayed that meager amount I brought up the nose and we were off the ground.
Immediately something felt wrong. We just weren’t building the speed, the indicator was actually going down so I lowered the nose even more and waited for the airspeed to move clockwise. I thought briefly about retracting the gear and as I looked up I saw that I still had time to perform a precautionary landing. I decided that it was better to be safe rather than sorry, as the visions of a flaming aircraft jumped back into my mind.
I chopped the power and set it on the runway with a firm bounce that was completely safe but very uncomfortable for my passenger. I brought the airplane to a stop and looked at my wife to see she was terrified.
“What happened?” she asked.
“It just didn’t feel right,” I said truthfully. “The airspeed wasn’t where I wanted it to be and it didn’t seem like it was picking up so I did what I’m supposed to do; I made a precautionary landing.”
We communicated with the tower. I thought that perhaps I had not tightened the friction knob enough and that the throttle control had slipped back, causing a slight loss of power which would explain the diminishing airspeed. I advised her I wanted to do a run up and if everything was okay to try again.
“I don’t feel good about this,” she said.
We taxi back and get another flawless run up. The engine sounded great and everything was in the green. This time I took it all the way to red line and counted to 11, the number of seconds it normally takes me to lift off.
I looked at my wife.
“Everything is fine,” I said, “I’m sure it was just something strange, the wind or something else, I’m not sure what. I think we are safe to go.”
“I don’t feel good about this,” she said again.
“We’ll try it one more time,” I said, “And we’ll see what happens. If everything is not perfect then we’ll go and have the mechanics look at it.”
We got clearance and started down the runway for the second time. Again all the gauges were in the green and the engine sounded perfect. The airspeed came alive just when it should but as it approached 55 knots it flickered down for a split second and that was enough for me to pull the power and taxi to the maintenance hangar.
When they stripped off the cowling and found nothing obvious, I called my mechanic at home and talked about the incident. He advised that if the manifold pressure is holding steady and the RPMs are against the peg, the engine is developing full power.
I told him about how I had rotated the nose early, and why.
“Don’t believe everything you read,” he said. “Fly the plane like you always have. Do what YOU think is best.”
After a compression test and a borescope, everything was pronounced airworthy. I did a test hop around the pattern, lifting off when it felt light. Perfect, and my confidence started a strong come back.
I went to where my wife was trying to relax in the pilot’s lounge.
“Honey,” I began, “There’s absolutely nothing wrong with the airplane.”
“Then what happened?” she asked.
I told her of the nightmares and I told her of the early rotation speed. I also told her that I believed it was my entire fault. She’s usually happy when I admit this. Not under these circumstances, however.
“Well that doesn’t make me feel any better,” she said.
While we were waiting for the aircraft to be examined, I had slipped into the flight planning office and purchased a ticket on Southwest. I presented it to her and said that it was her choice. She could fly with me and I was certain we would get there safely or she could take Southwest.
She took Southwest.
I drove her to Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport (GSB) in the FBO’s service van. As I dropped her off she started to reach for her luggage which contained her important prescriptions.
She looked me in the eye.
“Can you can take my bag? I won’t need it until you’re home anyway.”
A flush of relief flooded over me. She knew that I would be returning that evening and was entrusting me with important cargo she would need that night. At first I started to say, “Are you sure?” But I choked it back.
I kissed her warmly and told her I’d see her at home.
There’s a lot of trust that we place in our aircraft, in the system and in ourselves. Once you leave the ground it is up to that combination to return you there safely.
I learned decades ago that false bravado can cheer you along in this world. If you sound like you know what you’re doing and you act like you know what you’re doing, people will believe you know what you’re doing.
They’ll believe you even when you have not the slightest idea what you are doing.
Usually you can figure it out before you get caught.
It doesn’t work in an airplane. False bravado in the left seat can get you killed. The trust that you carry has to be inviolate: a certainty that you know what to do, how to do it and when.
For me, that trust has been an off-and-on thing. After I started flying, I spoke to a 777 first officer who lives in my neighborhood and revealed my fears.
He looked me straight in the eye as he had the dozens of students he shepherded while climbing the aviation ladder.
“It’s completely normal,” he said with a knowing smile.
“You just gotta have trust. Checklists are your friends, your mechanic is your guide but it is all up to you. Lots of people have done it,” he said confidently. “And you can too.”
After I reached 300 hours, I had stopped questioning my ability to do the basic things right. The crash, the numerous worried messages from friends, the problem with the radio, the change in procedures, the parking lot incident, my wife’s latent fear, the stress of considering a major change in our lives–each had taken bites from my confidence, some large, some small.
But the flight home was as uneventful as the one before and the dozens before that. The trust returned completely shortly after liftoff–at 63 knots.
Tower sent me to approach in the Southern Style: “Ya’ll come back now and have a safe trip.”
I danced gracefully around a few thunderstorms near Bowling Green.
The sunset as I neared Chicago was as beautiful as any you could imagine.
In the pattern, I tried unsuccessfully not to look at the crash site.
I greased the landing in an easterly 12-knot crosswind.
The next week I scheduled some time with my instructor to do some takeoffs and landings, shoot some approaches. We ended up sitting in the coffee shop and talking about what happened instead of flying.
There were no answers from him, only things I already knew. I’m a well-trained, low-time pilot. I’m doing the right things and this flight ended successfully.
He summed up. “You just have to know that you know what you’re doing.”
I still feel a hollow sickness about what happened. While I didn’t put a scratch on the airplane, something as important was broken. The fledgling trust my wife had placed in me.
I don’t know if she will ever fly with me again, and I will never ask her or pressure her in any way. I don’t blame her.
In the air, trust is all we have.",0.9865627288818359,3887,1.3515444993972778

"Gold has always stood for the safe haven of investment when inflation is high. We are currently experiencing a rise in inflation in Europe. What can this mean for the gold market and what impact does inflation have on the value of paper money? A contribution by economist Valentin Markus Schulte, Berlin.
A short consideration from the view of the precious metal dealer
Gold was one of the first metals to be processed by humans. The durability of the precious metal, the rarity of the find and the favorable physical properties made gold attractive to early man. The first gold finds have been dated by archaeologists to the year 4500 BC. In the Copper Age, systematic gold mining is said to have begun by man. At the beginning of the modern era, Spain rose to become a major European power due to extensive gold discoveries in the American colonies. Gold was the trigger for wars and campaigns of conquest and cost many lives. In historical observation, it is striking that gold has been used as a medium of exchange or as the first currency for thousands of years. In Germany, the gold mark was legal tender from 1871 to 1918.
At the beginning of the First World War, the Reichsbank’s gold cover was lifted in order to be able to increase the money supply unchecked. The war demanded large amounts of money that could no longer be held in gold in purely quantitative terms. Other nations lifted the gold peg of their currency much later. Most importantly, the gold peg of the U.S. dollar was removed in 1971. U.S. President Richard Nixon and his advisors in the White House in Washington, D.C., realized that the large quantity of dollars in circulation could no longer be backed in gold. The fact that the U.S. government had until then promised to exchange 35 dollars for an ounce of gold threatened the loss of U.S. gold reserves. A new era of monetary policy had dawned, in which central banks had a largely free hand.
From then on, paper money was just paper
This can be seen, for example, in the monetary policy of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt am Main. If the euro were gold-linked, it would not be possible to carry out government bond purchase programs worth billions, which are financed by increasing the money supply.
What is inflation?
Almost everyone knows the word inflation, but what does it mean? Inflation is a reduction in the purchasing power of money. In other words, money becomes worth less. This knowledge is based on the research of the British economist John Stuart Mill and was later concretized by the Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman. Inflation can result from an increase in the money supply by central banks or, in the short term, from demand pull inflation and supply push inflation. The central bank usually strives to maintain a certain level of inflation in its currency area. It does this, on the one hand, to provide an incentive for consumption and investment and, on the other, to reduce government debt or at least keep it stable.
Surveys show that the figures published by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt am Main do not match the feelings of the population.
The inflation index may be deceiving, and so are the feelings of the population. In any case, everyone who observes price trends over a longer period of time knows that prices are rising and that inflation is therefore a given. By the possession of gold an investor can protect himself at least to parts against it. Here a possibility is given to protect its money both for the case of an extreme crisis and before the creeping inflation.
„Gold seems to be more stable than paper money“
From time to time there are irritations regarding the gold price and phases of flattening. However, these are normal and not necessarily cause for alarm. What is important is that gold seems to be more stable than paper money. Forecasts about the further development of inflation or the further development of the gold price are difficult. However, private investors can be advised in good conscience to invest parts of their assets in gold as a hedge.

"STONY BROOK, NY, January 5, 2022 – Entering a third year of the COVID-19 pandemic and the latest infection surge nationwide comes with many challenges. One of those is for a continued adequate supply of masks, including the often used N95 respirator masks for healthcare and other settings. A study led by Stony Brook University researchers discovered that a readily available method using dry ovens can be used to disinfect N95s for reuse, in settings where new masks may not be available. Their findings are published in PLOS ONE.
To combat any shortages of N95 masks during the pandemic, many institutions were forced to search for other alternatives to protect health care providers and their patients. While some studies have evaluated the impact of various methods of decontamination on how well masks filter viral-sized particles, this study adds to such research and also addresses the equally important concept of maintaining proper mask fit after decontamination.
Electron microscopy image showing that dry head disinfection at 100 degrees C did not damage the microscopic structure of N95 masks.
“Our study demonstrated that treatment of N95 face masks using dry heat was sufficient to inactivate COVID-19, while preserving the ability of these masks to filter aerosolized particles for potentially exposed workers,” summarizes Kenneth Shroyer, MD, PhD, lead author and the Marvin Kushner Professor and Chair of Pathology at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University.
Since heat is potentially more readily accessible than other methods of decontamination in many healthcare facilities, the researchers used dry heat sterilization to disinfect the masks. They also used X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, contact angle, and electron microscopy collected at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials—a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science user facility at DOE’s Brookhaven National Laboratory—to test for changes in the material of N95 masks post decontamination.
By contrast, other methods for disinfection, including treatment with hydrogen peroxide vapor, may be equally effective in specially equipped facilities but are usually not available in most hospitals or outpatient clinical care facilities.
Graduate student John Yuen wearing an N95 mask for fit testing in the Aerosol Research Laboratory led by Daniel Knopf in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences.
Dr. Shroyer and colleagues also tested autoclaving, which is widely available in most hospitals and is a proven method of sterilization but found that this caused the fit of the respirator onto the user’s face to fail. Thus, the researchers ruled out autoclaving as a safe method to decontaminate N95 masks.
The research involved experts from the School of Medicine, the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the College of Arts and Sciences, the Institute for Electrochemically Stored Energy, and the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SoMAS), along with colleagues in the Interdisciplinary Science Department and the Center for Functional Materials at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
For additional details about the initial studies that served as the foundation for this study – which was launched during the first wave of the pandemic in April 2020 – see this story.
Dr. Shroyer emphasizes that the findings from the study highlight the importance of both optimal disinfection and mask fit and suggest that when no other decontamination alternatives are available, N95 masks can be reused after dry heat treatment to ensure the safety of health care workers.

"You know that the song isn’t really called that, and it’s not that we’re squeamish about words it’s just that if we use the unbleeped version it messes with whatever the internet search facility of choice is being used. Because we care so much about the detrimental effects of “bad words”. And yeah, replacing every adjective with a four-letter one is harmful for the development of fluid and rewarding language skills. Andrew Weiss knows this, but the point here is that there are things that can be more detrimental to one’s life chances – it’s just that in some places no-one like to talk about them. So the word “fuck” is terrible but as he asks “Aren’t you angry ? Aren’t you embarrassed? Aren’t you tired? Let’s change the subject. But twenty-one kids got shot today when they woke up this morning with smiles on their faces. Twenty-one kids got shot today when some guy bought a gun on his birthday.”
‘When it Rains, it Really Fucks Up My Mood‘ is not just an abstract pro-gun control song, as Andrew Weiss explains: “I wish this song didn’t have to be written, but yet, here we are. This song was birthed over the two days following the mass shooting in Uvalde a few months ago, and recorded during the following week. It was written, produced, recorded, and mixed in solitude. The lyrics express my concern with our society’s numbness to these shootings, when something as simple as bad weather can stir up a more intense reaction than these horrific, senseless acts. The song is accompanied by breathtaking artwork, contributed by Texas based artist Patrick Gabaldon. The artwork references the dark truth that one of the victims was only able to be identified by her shoes. What the fuck. We cannot become numb. Something must be done to protect the lives of these innocent people. My intention is pure. All proceeds from this song will be donated to organizations fighting to end gun violence, beginning with Everytown.”
With a heavy heart we await the inevitable negative responses, but just to save time: we don’t agree with you.",0.9602160453796387,481,1.5684192180633545

Catherine’s Crusade against Canada’s energy sector was a stunningly naïve, divisive, and economically destructive agenda that must have foreign countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and more laughing at us.
With Catherine McKenna announcing her retirement from politics, it’s important to take some time to consider her legacy as a federal minister.
Of course, many will be saying nice things about her on a personal level, and there’s no reason to believe those things are untrue.
By all accounts she seems like a nice human being, though of course you never really know.
But that’s not what we’re talking about here. Rather, this is about the results of the policies and worldview she pushed, particularly in her time as environment minister.
Catherine McKenna was one of the most divisive federal cabinet ministers in a long-time.
Her supporters claim this is because of ‘sexism,’ which of course raises the question of why other female ministers aren’t nearly as divisive as McKenna was.
Cries of ‘sexism’ and ‘racism’ are often used as a shield to demonize those who criticize a public official who is incompetent or who damages the country. So, we aren’t going to play that politically-correct game.
McKenna wasn’t divisive because she is a woman, she was divisive because she exhibited a naïve attitude, and because that naïve attitude did real material harm to this nation.
Like many naïve individuals, McKenna tended to see Canada – and by extension our Western allies – as the problem, and imposed (at Justin Trudeau’s behest of course) policies that would damage the economies of Canada and our allies while leaving most other countries either unscathed, or indeed benefitting from our losses.
Consider the Paris Climate Accord, which put restrictive targets on Canada, the US, and most Western Nations, while giving China, India, and many other countries more than a decade of emissions growth.
The practical, real-world effect of that would be that China would grow wealthier in proportion to the US and Canada. A wealthier China can afford a larger military, a larger military gives China more power to coerce other nations and impose their ruthless Communist system.
Some may dismiss this, but leaders must realize that everything is linked. You can’t make a change one area without that impacting other areas.
So, the more China gets a free pass on emissions while Canada, the US, and our other allies are held back, the more hostile the world becomes to freedom and democracy.
That’s the problem with naïve ‘feel-good’ thinking: It usually is totally incompatible with how the world really works.
Enriching foreign nations
The energy market doesn’t really care who supplies the needs of customers, so long as those needs are supplied.
Thus, every dollar Canada loses in energy sales because of the carbon tax, cancellation of pipelines, and projects that never even got under way because of McKenna’s anti-Canadian energy policies, will be a dollar that goes to a foreign country.
Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Russia, Nigeria, and more are all glad to pick up the slack.
What this means, in the brutal practical reality of life, is that there are schools in Saudi Arabia that were built with money that should have been building a school in Canada, there were roads paved in Russia that should have been paved in Canada, and there were weapons bought in Iran that could have been been bought for Canada’s moribund Armed Forces.
McKenna and Trudeau didn’t do anything to shrink the global energy market, they simply ensured that Canadians would have a smaller slice of it, making foreign countries wealthier at our expense.
Making emissions worse
Here’s where McKenna’s naïve approach really gets absurd:
Even by her own supposed goals, her policies backfired.
Given that demand for oil, natural gas, and coal remains high in many parts of the world, and will remain so due to rising energy needs in many growing countries, the best way to assure environmental protection while meeting those needs is for the energy supply to come from countries with strong environmental and labour protections.
Canada – and Alberta in particular – are world leaders in that regard.
So the more that energy demand is filled by Canada, the better off the world will be in terms of emissions. This is something the Conservatives got 100% right in their energy policy under Andrew Scheer, and they should have stuck with it, rather than their shameful surrender to the Carbon Tax Cult.
So, given that more Canadian energy is good for the planet, What did Catherine McKenna’s policy accomplish?
THE EXACT OPPOSITE.
Catherine’s Crusade ‘for the planet’ was actually a crusade against the Canadian Energy Industry, which ironically means McKenna was indirectly doing the bidding of the oil and gas industries/state-owned energy companies in countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Looking at all of this, foreign dictatorships must be laughing at Canada, and with good reason.
McKenna’s policies had the practical effect of making Canadians poorer, driving away jobs and opportunities, and pushing those jobs opportunities and wealth into foreign countries all while worsening emissions.
Dividing the country
Western Alienation is surging, in large part due to how Justin Trudeau and Catherine McKenna govern and put their boot on the neck of the Western Canadian Energy Sector.
People in Western Canada can see the hypocrisy, see the naivety, and feel the damage of McKenna’s policies.
In Western Canada, People are well aware that tremendous opportunities have been lost, and people have watched those opportunities go not only to countries overseas, but right over the border to our good friends down south. Watching jobs and wealth flee to the United States has only reinforced how damaging McKenna/Trudeau’s policies have been.
Literally, the only things McKenna ‘accomplished’ was to hurt Canadians, further divide our country, and make foreign countries richer.
And as we know, those ‘accomplishments’ are really failures, failures that our country is still dealing with at this very moment, and which threaten the economic future of our nation and put our national unity in peril.
That’s Catherine McKenna’s legacy in federal politics",0.9651314616203308,1344,1.9773552417755127

"A Trump official claims in an op-ed that the US has proof that it was North Korea behind the WannaCry cyber attack, citing a “careful investigation.” However, he also launched into various allegations against other countries.
In a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled “It’s Official: North Korea Is Behind WannaCry,” White House Homeland Security advisor Tom Bossert claimed on Monday that the US's findings in their investigation are “based on evidence.”
North Korea is named by Bossert as the culprit in the attack, however, no particular organization or person affiliated with the North Korean government was specifically named in the homeland security advisor’s Op-Ed.
The US is not the only country that attributes the WannaCry attack to North Korea, Bossert adds.
“Other governments and private companies agree. The United Kingdom attributes the attack to North Korea, and Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of the North Korean government,” Bossert stated.
In May 2017, the global WannaCry cyber attack targeted computers around the world that used the Windows operating system. During the attack, personal data was stolen from private users and ransom payment was requested in the form of bitcoin.
While North Korea is the main focus of Bossert's claims in the Op-Ed, he does not forget to talk about alleged 2016 election meddling by Russian hackers or the US’s issues with Iran either.
In relation to thwarting alleged malicious behavior online, Bossert credits President Donald Trump for “continu[ing] sanctions on Russian hackers and direct[ing] the most transparent and effective government effort in the world to find and share vulnerabilities in important software.”
Bossert named one Russian-based tech company by name when alluding to alleged meddling by Russia against the US, and wrote that in 2017, “the Trump administration ordered the removal of all Kaspersky software from government systems. A company that could bring data back to Russia represents an unacceptable risk on federal networks.”
Kaspersky CEO Eugene Kaspersky has denied being part of any nefarious plot with the Russian government to spy on Western countries, and stated in November: “If the Russian government comes to me and asks me to anything wrong, or my employees, I will move the business out of Russia.”
Bossert continues in his Op-Ed to tout what he believes are Trump's achievements in the realm of thwarting cyber attacks.
“We brought charges against Iranian hackers who hacked several U.S. companies, including HBO. If those hackers travel, we will arrest them and bring them to justice.”
The homeland security advisor goes on to mention strategy to stop future cyber attacks carried out by countries like Iran, and says, “we must call out bad behavior, including that of the corrupt regime in Tehran. Whenever possible, we will work with partners, industry and allied governments, who share our market based values. We will rally our allies, and we will ensure the U.S. is again the leader in securing the internet we invented.”
Bossert closes out his article by stating that North Korea ""continues to threaten America, Europe and the rest of the world – and not just with its nuclear aspirations.”
“It is increasingly using cyberattacks to fund its reckless behavior and cause disruption across the world,” Bossert said. “Mr. Trump has already pulled many levers of pressure to address North Korea’s unacceptable nuclear and missile developments, and we will continue to use our maximum pressure strategy to curb Pyongyang’s ability to mount attacks, cyber or otherwise.”
Ahead of the claims about North Korea being responsible for the WannaCry attack, on Monday, the US military released photos of massive joint drills it underwent recently with its ally South Korea, and have called the exercise ‘Warrior Strike IX.’
The event was held at Camp Stanley, a US military facility located some 20 km from Seoul, South Korea, according to a statement by the US Army. The four-day joint military drills ended on December 15.

"Varsity match by year:
Click on images for an enlargementIn play at Hurlingham |
In 1961 Cambridge beat Oxford in the first ever Croquet Varsity Match. So on 20th June 2011, the 50th anniversary of that first match, the question was: would Cambridge be able to halt their run of defeats in recent years and repeat that initial victory? On paper the odds were against it, not least because of the huge growth in popularity of the Association Croquet game at Oxford: this year the annual internal Oxford University 'Cuppers' tournament has more than 1,800 participants, an extraordinary number, which Oxford claims to be the largest competition they have ever held in any sport. Remarkable.
The Cambridge squad arrived ready for the fray at the Hurlingham Club host venue, only to discover that their opponents were an hour late, having been stuck in traffic on the M4 (along with your reporter) following an accident. So play started under sunny skies at 11:30, and a reduced time-limit of 2½ hours was agreed for both morning and afternoon sessions. The forecast of late afternoon rain might perhaps have had something to do with it as well, after the drenching last year. The match format was the same as usual: three doubles games in the morning and six singles in the afternoon, all played to Level Advanced rules.
On court 2, Oxford's Nigel Urban soon made a flying start, and quickly executed a tidy 4-ball break round to 4-back. His leave would also have been a tidy diagonal spread but for one mistake, which was leaving his rush pointing towards hoop 1 rather than along the diagonal, and thus a double target for the Cambridge lift to A-baulk - which they duly hit. Likewise on court 3 Oxford's Harry Fisher had also made good progress to 4-back. His Cambridge opponent Rob Thorman was able to catch him up with his own break to 4-back, but his rather loose leave provided Oxford with a triple target shooting from B-baulk, with the inevitable consequence. Meanwhile on court 4, Oxford's captain and strongest player, William Gee, had been holding back while trying to help his partner Simon Picot round. But when partner had only reached hoop 4 after 90 minutes, and with the likelihood of a finish on time becoming stronger, Will decided to abandon the hope of a TP and took himself round to 4-back when an opportunity arose. Then as the final hour of play passed, Oxford pair Nigel Urban and John Gale both made it to the first peg-out, while on the other two courts the lead Oxford players in each pair progressed to peg and ended with comfortable wins on time after their Cambridge opponents missed their remaining lift shots. Score at lunch: 3-0 to Oxford.
After lunch, and suitably fortified by the excellent Hurlingham hospitality, the teams resumed with the six singles games. These were played once again to a 2½-hour time-limit. For aficionados the top game brought the enticing prospect of an A-class battle between two minus-handicappers: Oxford's William Gee vs. Cambridge's Sam Tudor - the latter mysteriously having been left 'on the bench' during the morning doubles in spite of his being easily Cambridge's strongest player. Will won the toss and put his first ball to the east boundary. Sam laid a Duffer tice which Will ignored, instead joining up on the east boundary. Sam missed his tice, and Will was able to pick up the break to 4-back with a NSL, but with Sam's yellow tight against the north side of 4 and therefore not rushable to 1. Sam took the long lift shot from B-baulk, missing into corner IV. Will then had to rush yellow some 8 yards north of hoop 1 and try a long backwards take-off approach, which ran into the hoop, so he retreated to the boundary. Sam missed the ball by 2, and Will was able to hit in and start arranging his TP. Everything went well until the 4-back peel attempt at 3 when he ran 3 too far and knocked the peelee out of position on the return roquet. So revert to plan B - the delayed triple. The 4-back peel was successful while going to 6, after which the break became somewhat erratic with the consequence that the final two peels had to be attempted straight. The penult peel from several yards away only just trickled through, blocking the path for striker's ball, and a rather desperate attempt at promoting peelee with a cannon from another croqueted ball ended in failure, leaving Will with no option but to try an awkward scatter shot, which also failed off the hoop. Sam duly took his opportunity and his first ball round to 4-back, leaving a tight diagonal spread. Will took the long lift shot from B-baulk, hitting centre ball, and from there his finish to a +17 win was relatively routine.

In the other games, Harry Fisher had a straightforward +26 win against Edward Turnham, securing the fifth win and the match for Oxford; John Gale was never in trouble against Tony Williams on his way to a +18 win; and Luke Valori built and held onto his advantage against James Folliard. For a while it looked as though Cambridge's Rob Thorman and Rush Cosgrove both might prevail against their respective opponents Nigel Urban and Jonathan Lindsell, but as the time limit approached both these games turned Oxford's way too, with Nigel managing to peg out to complete his +4 win within time. Well-timed, since the light rain arrived as expected just as play finished. Final score: 9-0 to Oxford.

"Before my pseudo triplets were diagnosed with lead poisoning, I knew what all my friends knew about lead in old homes: Just don’t lick the paint or let your kids touch peeling paint chips, and you’ll probably be totally fine. How devastatingly wrong I was.
Even seemingly unchipped paint, when on high-friction areas (like doors and windows), can produce microscopic dust: enough to sicken or poison a small child.
A window A/C can blow in lead dust from a window built before 1978, or can blow in lead dust from construction outside: enough to sicken a child.
Many popular children’s toys and foods contain lead at high enough levels to sicken a child–yes, even in 2024.
Lead is such a prevalent problem that there was a recall this year on over 450,000 children’s toys sold at Costco for containing an illegal level of lead paint. And in 2023, over 500 children were lead poisoned (or had elevated lead levels) by a popular children’s apple cinnamon food pouch.
Lead is so highly toxic that if a child does get access to peeling paint, a tiny chip the size of a pinky fingernail can put them in a coma or even be fatal.
But even microscopic lead exposure is dangerous. There is no safe level of lead. And all it takes is a sugar packet’s worth of lead dust, sprinkled over an area the size of a football field, to poison a child.
“Children can become poisoned in the blink of an eye,” Jane Nickert, director of nursing at the Washtenaw Health Department, said. “Unfortunately it takes longer for lead levels to start coming down once they’ve been poisoned; they don’t decline as quickly as they go up.”
Lead can be in children’s art supplies, bathtubs, jewelry, children’s toys, processed foods, used rugs and even permeate popular hobbies.
“Lead is an equal opportunity poison,” Nickert said. She notes that in Washtenaw County, “We are seeing kids poisoned in areas (with new housing) that we might not expect.”
If you want to protect your child from any lead exposure, here are 20 areas in which lead can show up in your everyday life.
Avoid lead in your FOOD. Lead can be in:
Certain foods, such as spinach and sunflower
Root vegetables such as potatoes, carrots and cassava
These are more vulnerable to lead contamination because they are grown in the soil, so any lead-containing particles can attach to the skin and even leech through the skin onto the food itself. Any dirt on the skin is a potential lead contaminant.
Any processed foods
Processing equipment in factories is notorious for often having parts that are worn down, exposing lead paint or lead parts and contaminating the foods they are processing. This is why the same food (a potato, for example) is at much higher risk of being lead-contaminated when it’s processed vs cooked at home: since lead contamination can occur at the growing, processing, and packaging stages of food, this means homecooked food is only at risk at the “growing” stage, vs processed foods, which are at risk at all three stages.
These are notorious for carrying high levels of lead. In some countries, lead is flat-out added to spices like turmeric to beautify its color, so be wary of purchasing spices from other countries. Turmeric, chili powder, coriander, cloves, and curry are all high-risk spices.
Avoid lead in your home. Lead can be in:
Any painted surface, pre-1978
Lead paint wasn’t banned in the U. S. until 1978, so any surface painted before then has the risk of containing lead; and any home built before 1940 is considered guaranteed to have lead paint.
A lead inspection can show you if there’s any lead under layers of paint. Painting over walls with encapsulation paint is often considered sufficient to contain lead, but not for high-friction areas like doors or windows. If these contain lead, they can still leech through as microscopic dust.
“Who would think the simple act of opening and closing a window in an old home, even if the paint is intact, just that friction can create lead dust?” Nickert said. “There’s a misconception that a child has to pick a paint chip off the wall and put it in the mouth, but that’s not how most children are poisoned. Lead is heavy and tends to fall to the ground, and then children (especially younger children) explore the ground via hand to mouth skills.”
Some bathtub glazes contain lead; and virtually all clawfoot tubs contain lead.
Many homes actually still have lead pipes bringing the water. Lead can also exist in homes without lead service lines, because brass or chrome-plated brass faucets can use lead solder. To be safer, test your water for lead; only use cold water for drinking and cooking (hot water contains more lead particles); let the water run for several minutes before you use it to flush out water that’s been sitting in the pipes (with more time to gather lead); and purchase a lead-certified water filter.
Your soil can become contaminated by chipping paint; renovations (even ones done inside); or your neighbor’s home. Soil near a home is more risky than soil further out in your yard; and yards by busy roads can be more at-risk than yards in quieter areas. Home lead inspections will also test your soil, especially if it’s a child’s play area.
Construction disturbs soil and can send lead-contaminated particles into the air. Yes, this is scary in Michigan, since so much of the summer is construction season! Nickert notes, “There’s a slight increase in lead levels in the summer months because children are playing outside more, or we open our windows more, or there’s more road construction–it can get into the air and get into our houses.” She said the Health Department is seeing more and more lead poisoning levels “coincide with construction.
Avoid lead in your Activities/ hobbies. Lead can be in:
Children’s art supplies
Yes, even art supplies labeled non-toxic. For example, sidewalk chalk marketed for children and sold at Target contained dangerous levels of lead.
Children’s toys or accessories
Dlesot toddler barrettes from Amazon were tested to contain 31,000ppm of lead in the red and white barrettes (any lead over 90ppm is illegal for items used by children) in 2024. The Stanley Jr. Kids Wheelbarrow and 7-piece Garden Sets, marketed for kids, contained an illegal level of lead and over 450,000 units were recalled after being sold at Costco in 2024.
Imported toys or other objects
Try not to buy toys from countries like China, for example — millions of toys from China contain high levels of lead. Avoid cheap websites like Temu and Wish, which source from low-regulation countries–be aware that items on Amazon can come from these places too.
Imported or antique/vintage cookware or tupperware can contain dangerous lead in the glaze.
It can be especially prevalent in glazes.
This family experienced lead poisoning due to their children swimming in a pool where the filter lines were weighed down with scuba weights.
High levels of lead have been found in various jewelries, including cheap children’s jewelry.
Fishing sinkers and ammunition are all high-risk activities. Lead contamination can get on your clothes, skin or car from these activities and can expose your child.
Auto repair work, recycling batteries, working with antiques, or working in construction are all also high-risk activities that can bring dangerous levels of lead into the home.
This is the first article in our series on lead poisoning hazards for Michigan’s children: its prevalence, its impact, how to avoid being lead poisoned, and how to heal after exposure has happened.",0.9639923572540283,1720,2.7971980571746826
"Healthy skin is characterized by a balanced skin barrier and a well-hydrated epidermis. Discover what the skin's barrier function is and how to keep it strengthened and in balance.
The skin barrier is the outer surface of the skin, composed of cells, lipids and amino acids. When the skin's barrier function is working properly there is a hydrolipidic balance.
The importance of the skin barrier function
Its main functions are protection and moisture retention. A healthy skin barrier can help defend against environmental aggressors such as sun and pollution. When strengthened, it can counteract the action of free radicals, which cause premature aging of the skin, as well as various disorders such as sensitivity, redness or flaking. The skin barrier also has the function of retaining and regulating moisture within the skin.
The entire Annie Blume collection has been formulated to respect and strengthen the skin barrier, so that it is balanced, healthy, hydrated, nourished and prevents premature skin aging.
Causes of a damaged skin barrier
The balance of the hydrolipidic film can be disturbed for a multitude of reasons. Externally, UVA and UVB rays, pollution, pollen, sudden changes in temperature, air conditioning and heating. Internally, stress and cyclical changes of the skin have an influence.
In skin care, there are also triggers of barrier function imbalance such as shaving and waxing, using a cleanser with a high detergent content (they tend to foam a lot and leave the skin tight), sleeping with make-up or sunscreen, chemical peels, aggressive active ingredients, etc.
How to strengthen the barrier function
First of all, the most important product is the cleanser. RAINFOREST has been formulated to remove dirt while respecting the skin's hydrolipidic mantle. It also provides the skin with vitamins, enzymes and nutrition. Therefore, after washing your face, your skin does not feel tight. And, thanks to its lactic acid content, it helps to restore the skin's natural balance.
Next, it is advisable to opt for ingredients that help to retain water in the skin. Hyaluronic acid, present in SUNSHINE lightweight moisturizer, retains up to 1.000 times its weight in water, ensuring that the skin stays hydrated all day long.",0.9395672082901001,476,2.62864089012146

"What is better MDF or particle board?
MDF (Medium-density fiberboard) and particleboard are both engineered wood products, but they have some differences that make one better suited for certain applications than the other.
MDF is made by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into fibers, which are then combined with wax and resin binders under heat and pressure. MDF is smoother, denser and more uniform than particleboard, making it a popular choice for furniture, cabinetry, millwork and musical instruments. It also takes paint and finishes well and does not shrink or swell much with changes in humidity. However, MDF is more expensive and heavier than particleboard and not as strong or durable.
Particleboard, on the other hand, is made from larger wood chips, sawdust and shavings that are combined with resin and compressed under high pressure. Particleboard is a low-cost alternative to solid wood and MDF, but it is less dense, less uniform and less smooth, with visible chip and knot defects. Particleboard also swells and shrinks more than MDF with changes in humidity, and it is not as strong or moisture-resistant. Particleboard is often used in applications where weight and cost are important, such as shelving, floor underlayment, and as a substrate for laminates and veneers.
In summary, MDF is a better choice for applications where appearance and uniformity are important, while particleboard is better suited for applications where cost and weight are the main concerns.",0.9719013571739197,320,2.4973268508911133

A filing system is indefinitely expandable, rhizomatic (at any point of timeor space, one can always insert a new card); in contradistinction with the sequen-tial irreversibility of the pages of the notebook and of the book, its interiormobility allows for permanent reordering (for, even if there is no narrative conclu-sion of a diary, there is a last page of the notebook on which it is written: its pagesare numbered, like days on a calendar).
Most writing systems and forms force a beginning and an end, they force a particular structure that is both finite and limiting. The card index (zettelkasten) may have a beginning—there's always a first note or card, but it never has to have an end unless one's ownership is so absolute it ends with the life of its author. There are an ever-increasing number of ways to order a card index, though some try to get around this to create some artificial stability by numbering or specifically ordering their cards. New ideas can be accepted into the index at a multitude of places and are always internally mobile and re-orderable.
link to Luhmann's works on describing this sort of rhizomatic behavior of his zettelkasten
Within a network model framing for a zettelkasten, one might define thinking as traversing a graph of idea nodes in a particular order. Alternately it might also include randomly juxtaposing cards and creating links between ones which have similarities. Which of these modes of thinking has a higher order? Which creates more value? Which requires more work?",0.9244168996810913,343,1.8301515579223633

"This metric tracks the ratio of a channel's content that features sponsorships. A high fulfillment rate suggests the channel is selling most of its available sponsorship inventory. While we don’t reduce prices for channels with lower fulfillment rates—recognizing that some creators may intentionally limit sponsored content or have not yet opened their channel to sponsorships—higher fulfillment rates do reflect strong demand. Channels with greater sponsorship activity tend to command higher rates due to their proven ability to attract multiple sponsors.
Monitors how often sponsors renew their partnerships. A low renewal rate suggests the channel isn't delivering strong results, as satisfied brands typically want to purchase sponsorships again. This metric reflects the channel's effectiveness in maintaining sponsor satisfaction. On average, channels across YouTube see a renewal rate of 10%, with the highest frequency at 0%. A strong renewal rate typically starts at around 35%.
Measures the percentage of a YouTube channel's audience based in the United States. This metric is crucial for understanding the potential ad revenue and sponsorship opportunities for a channel. The higher purchasing power and larger market size of the US audience in addition to the US market having a larger pool of advertisers, leading to increased competition, increases the cost per mille (CPM) rates for ads shown to US viewers. While we’ve collected US demographic data for thousands of channels, the data for this specific channel is currently unavailable, meaning the algorithm cannot account for this variable. Upgrade now to unlock premium insights, including demographic analytics for other channels.
To maximize the impact of a sponsorship, we recommend that YouTubers include on-camera appearances. This approach has been proven to enhance viewer engagement and sponsorship effectiveness. When creators show their face and personally interact with the product or service, their endorsements come across as more sincere and genuine. This authenticity fosters a stronger connection with the audience, making the sponsorship more engaging and likely to convert.
The trend score on our site quantifies a YouTube channel's viewership momentum by measuring the angle of its view trend over time. This score, ranging from +90° to -90°, reflects how a channel's projected views at 7 days are increasing or decreasing. A positive trend score (between 0° and 90°) indicates a strong upward trajectory, meaning the channel is rapidly gaining viewers and becoming more popular. Conversely, a negative trend score (between 0° and -90°) signals a downward trend, suggesting the channel is losing viewers. This metric bridges the gap between the channel's 30-day projected views and its current performance, providing an up-to-date snapshot of its viewership dynamics.
When buying a sponsorship, remember it won't go live immediately due to time spent finalizing the deal and contacting the channel. This delay means the sponsorship's effectiveness will align with the channel's future trend, so the price should reflect the projected growth or decline.
This metric evaluates a video's long-term viewership and growth by comparing its views 30 days after upload to its views 180 days later. The evergreen score is calculated as the ratio of views at day 180 to views at day 30. A score of 1 signifies that by day 180, the video has accumulated twice the views it had at day 30. This score reflects the video's ongoing ability to attract viewers beyond its initial release, demonstrating its enduring appeal for sponsors. On average, most YouTube channels have an evergreen score ranging from 0.15 to 0.30.",0.945703387260437,692,1.2606607675552368

"Backwash, perspiration, and saliva all contribute to the smell of a water bottle. Keeping water bottles in a moist place or keeping the lid on for lengthy periods without liquid in the bottle might lead to an unpleasant aroma.
Reasons Why Does My Water Bottle Smell:
The usage of water bottles is vital to reducing the amount of single-use plastic in our environment. Despite their ease and durability, these bottles also are susceptible to “unpleasant” odors.
- Disposable plastic water bottles often develop an unpleasant odour after a week or two of being opened, as you may have experienced. It is a stench that slowly grows on you, becoming more overpowering as time passes.
People who want to save money and reduce their environmental impact by refilling and reusing water bottles may find themselves in a pickle.
- Is there a reason why these water bottles begin to smell bad so quickly? Bottles made of other materials, such as stainless steel or aluminium, do not have this issue. Why is it that not all plastic bottles have this problem?
Disposable plastic bottles are constructed of low-quality plastic that is more susceptible to heat and light than high-quality plastic containers, making them less durable. They may rapidly decay if left in the sun or heat, resulting in an unpleasant stench.
- Even while it may be a contributing element, bacteria that accumulate on the interior of a plastic container are more likely to cause the stench. All of us know that any wet surface attracts germs, and the interior of a water bottle is a wet surface by definition.
If the bottle is empty, the interior of the plastic is likely coated with condensation created by water that evaporates from the bottom of the bottle.
- It might be challenging to remove germs and stains from a plastic surface once they have built up. Cleaning utensils can’t fit in most water bottles because of their narrow mouths. Thus, this is particularly true. When a water bottle starts to smell, most people toss it away and buy a new one.
- To remove the odour and extend the life of your water bottle, there are a few methods that you may use to attempt to do so. You’ll have to clean these bottles by hand since they can’t be placed in the dishwasher.
- After filling it with water, add soap or detergent and shake it well. Fill the bottle to the brim with water after vigorously shaking it for about a minute.
As long as the bottle is left open, the solution will loosen dirt, filth, and germs. After that, please give it a good, thorough wash in cold water.
- It will typically smell better after that, and you may use it for a little longer before it returns. To save yourself the hassle, consider purchasing a high-quality water bottle that can be washed and reused time and time again without deterioration.
- Disposable plastic water bottles can’t compete with that long-term solution. That musty stench will get you if dangerous chemicals seeping out of your plastic container don’t. If you’re going to spend any money, it’s best to do it right the first time.
Why Does My Water Bottle Smell Like Rotten Eggs?
The presence of hydrogen sulphide might give your water bottle a rotten egg smell. Sulphur bacteria, particularly in well water, may cause this issue if there is a problem with the water heater. Hydrogen sulphide, a noxious odour, may be produced due to these problems.
Why Does My Water Bottle Smell Like Sweat?
Poor cleaning, the development of microbes, enhanced sulfur water, mould induced by excess soap, or the chemical interaction between minerals in water with a plastic material that has begun leaching plasticizers are the most common causes of foul smells like sweat in reusable plastic water bottles.
Why Does My Water Bottle Smell Like Dirt?
Using reusable water bottles instead of single-use plastic bottles is a far better solution for the environment. However, use it for just a long period without cleaning it properly.
You’ll become ill when water bottles are kept in a moist environment or with their lids tightly closed, the bacteria that cause foul odours grow more rapidly, so they smell terrible.
Because the liquid is the only item we keep in our water bottles, we do not clean them after each usage. However, germs from your mouth might enter the bottle & start blossoming, resulting in an unpleasant odour.
- Mould In Soap
Water bottles that smell bad are either replaced by a new one or washed, depending on how terrible the odour is. If you accidentally leave soap residue in the bottle or the lid, it might grow mould and become an unpleasant stench.
Why Does My Water Bottle Smell Like Metal?
- Bacteria Colonize and Proliferate
There is a chance that germs and mould might develop up. Even if you’re solely drinking water from your water bottle, small quantities of acids produced by these bacteria may degrade stainless steel and cause it to smell or leach into your beverages.
Using bleach in the water bottle or noticing that the water bottle is rusting in places might contribute to the overpowering metal taste and odour.
- Acidic beverages
A tiny amount of corrosion may occur in stainless steel from acidic beverages such as lemon juice or water and other variations of the citrus fruit, including coffee, tea, soda, and more. Your acidic drink will not be affected much, but you may detect a metallic taste when you fill your water bottle.
Why Does My Water Bottle Smell Like Plastic?
Let us take a closer look at these factors.

Inadequate cleaning is a significant contributor to plastic bottles’ musty aroma. If they are not cleaned correctly after each use, water bottles acquire scents and slight discolouration. Keeping the water bottle wet or sealing it for an extended period might speed up the process.
Some individuals use the bottle without washing with detergent for a lengthy period. There are unpleasant aromas that develop over time that may be tasted in the beverage when consumed. Foul odours might also be caused by improper storage.
If the plastic bottle is to be reused several times, it is advised to be well cleaned. If the plastic bottle is not going to be used for a lengthy period, another suggestion is to empty it and flip it inverted to drain all the liquid.
Microorganisms will have a time that is more challenging spreading if the bottles are dry.
They believe that water is the only item in their bottle. Thus they do not wash it every time they use it. This is a common misconception. Microorganisms may, however, infiltrate your bottle every moment you take a drink.
A lousy odour might also be caused by dust particles in the air entering the bottle and growing. Microorganisms may survive and thrive in water because it is clean and dissolves organic materials.
A biofilm of bacteria builds if you observe an oily or slippery coating within the plastic water bottle. These germs cause foul odours in the future.
Why Does My Water Bottle Smell Sour?
Drinking from reusable water bottles causes an unpleasant odour since germs from backwash, sweat, and saliva are all collected in the bottles. Reusable water bottles may develop an unpleasant odour quicker if kept in a moist environment or if the lid is left on tightly for an extended time.
Why Does My Water Bottle Smell Gas?
Clean water has no smell. In the event of a chemical spill, do not consume any water that has been exposed to a strong odour. After hearing that plastic water bottles of this size were being used to store fuel and subsequently recycled back into drinking water bottlers in Massachusetts, this precaution is recommended.
Why Does My Water Bottle Smell Chemicals?
To get rid of a plastic-like flavour, you must wash the bottle. To prevent water stains, dry the bottle thoroughly after washing it. After purchasing one, it’s also essential to wash a new plastic water bottle right away.
Why Does My Water Bottle Smell Mold?
Bacteria buildup is the primary cause of a water bottle’s mouldy odour. This is a typical issue when you drink from a water bottle regularly. They may be an issue if you don’t routinely and adequately cleanse your water bottle.
The unfortunate reality is that many individuals leave their bottles locked or in moist places for lengthy periods without any water inside of them. The smell and taste are also awful. It’s best to keep your bottle without the lid once you’ve washed it so that it can air dry rapidly.
You can avoid a repeat of the problem if you know how it got there in the first place. There is no need to worry about the scent of your water bottle after using this method.
- Improper Cleanliness
As a result, they are excellent at trapping smells and germs. Mould and mildew may grow in water containers that haven’t been thoroughly cleaned. When this happens, the fragrance of the bottle’s contents might be transferred to the liquids within.
Keep your water bottle fresh by cleaning it regularly to avoid a mouldy odour. When not in use, allow your water bottle to dry thoroughly before reusing it.
- Cold Weather
Both plastic and metal water bottles are impacted when it comes to hot weather. As a result, the water bottles’ fragrance resembles a wet dog’s since the water bottles’ air or gas has dissolved. The temperature does not affect stainless steel water bottles like the Hydro Cell stainless steel bottles.
The ThermoCell technology used in the manufacture of Hydro Cell water bottles offers excellent insulation. Since of this, your water bottle will not smell like a wet dog because temperatures will not affect the bottles.
- The Amount Of Time You Keep Water Stored
When you keep your water in a metal or plastic container for an extended time, it begins to smell mould. This is because plastics and certain metals may contaminate the water supply.
On the other hand, stainless steel water bottles like the Hydro Cell water bottles don’t create a lingering odour when used to store water. Hydro Cell water bottles keep water fresh for a whole week with the best vacuum seal technology available.
Why Does My Water Bottle Smell Like Vinegar?
Your water is probably tainted with chlorine if it has a vinegar scent. As a disinfectant used in cities for more than a century, chlorine is a prevalent contaminant in municipally supplied water.
People, other animals and birds are safe in tiny amounts of chlorinated water that kills various microorganisms. However, chlorinated water should be avoided by all reptiles, amphibians, and aquatic pets.
When it comes to chlorine-treated water, the most common criticism is that it has a disagreeable taste and odour.
Why Does My Water Bottle Smell Like Feet?
Since the bottom of a bottle is difficult to clean, germs and mould may form there. After more than a day without washing the bottle, a thorough overnight soaking in boiling should get rid of a faint stink.
Why Does My Water Bottle Smell Weird?
One of the most common causes of plastic bottles smelling bad or weird is a lack of thorough cleaning. If a plastic water bottle is not thoroughly cleaned after each use, it may eventually acquire smells and slight discoloration.
If the water bottle is kept in a moist environment or sealed with water for a lengthy period, the process may be accelerated.
It is best to clean your plastic water bottle regularly and avoid leaving it unclean or overflowing with water. Your plastic water bottles will last longer if they are immediately drained and cleaned after each use.
Soap should be used sparingly, and you should permanently remove any soap residue from the water bottle’s lid or the lid of the water bottle. Soap should be used regularly to prevent microbial contamination, which is the most common odour source. Plastic bottles may be cleansed and deodorized with a tiny quantity of bleach if your condition is more urgent. If water has to be stored for an extended period, the content of sulfur compounds should be checked as well.",0.9376857876777649,2552,2.9857568740844727
"Electrolyte water contains minerals, including chloride, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, calcium, and potassium. Every element is precisely balanced in a mixer to achieve a perfect solution to boost energy. Dehydration, sweating can lose the minerals to be compensated using electrolyte water.
Is propel electrolyte water good for you?
Propel electrolyte come with additional minerals and vitamins that boost your energy immediately. Compared to the normal electrolyte water, the propel water has vitamin B, Antioxidant vitamins C & E.
Consumption of the propel electrolyte water hydrate your body quickly and immediately makes you full of energy. It is the best energy source when you are doing a physical workout. Athletes who need instant energy boosts use propel electrolyte water.
Drinking propels water improves your performance and helps you to stay on the field longer. The energy supply promotes muscle building. The body’s loss of essential minerals during the workout or excess sweating is immediately repaired with the proper water.
The human body is made of vital minerals. The minerals and vitamins perform as fuel to the body. When you are involved in a physical workout, the energy is burned and released in the heat. Sweating is another reason why the body loses liquid.
If the person is not taking any vital minerals during the workout session, they might feel exhausted. It would be hard to get back to normal conditions without suppling the right minerals to the body.
People who spend a few hours every day in the physical workout should use the propel electrolyte water to stay vertical. It will improve your game and make you enjoy your training session.
Can electrolyte water be heated?
Electrolyte water should not be heated. The vital minerals and vitamins would evaporate when the water is heated, leaving fewer ingredients in the water. Electrolyte water is meant for boosting energy.
The less amount of vitamins and minerals could affect the energy supply. Drinking hot electrolyte water would not contribute to the energy enhancement making it difficult for the person to get the right energy.
Why does electrolyte water taste salty?
Electrolyte water is made using various minerals, including Chlorides, Sulphate, Nitrites, Sulphites, Mealates, cyanides, etc.
All these minerals taste like salt. The saltiness would be different levels in each of the minerals; however, when combined with other elements, the water becomes salty in most cases.
Most of the brand that produces electrolyte water uses these energy-boosting minerals to enhance the power of the water. Some brands use minerals that add sweetener to the water.
The high amount of sweetener reduces the effect of saltwater. The salty taste is covered by these sweet-tasting minerals, which make the other minerals unnoticed in the drink.
Smartwater drinks contain 2.5 mg of potassium, 2.5 mg magnesium, and 2.5 mg calcium. Innovative water manufacturers include significantly less amount of the electrolyte that makes the water taste better than the pure water.
Every electrolyte water supplier brand uses its recipes to make the water taste good and provide a great experience. The salt level in the water would be different in every drink.
Do electrolytes keep you awake?
Yes. The electrolyte contains vital ingredients that promote alertness in the body. Therefore, when the players go on the field with electrolyte drinks, they feel more active due to the energy boost.
Electrolyte provides positive energy, but at the same time, it also contributes to keeping you awake. There are many studies done on the players who consume the electrolytes during the game.
It has been found that the sportsperson who drinks the electrolyte before bedtime finds it challenging to sleep. It develops the insomnia symptoms player. Also, there will be other health issues that could be seen, such as nervousness.
Electrolyte boosts energy between 3 to 7 percent, but at the same time, there are many other side effects of the electrolyte water that needs to be considered before you decide to have them.
If you drink the electrolyte water with caution, there will be no impact on your health. You should avoid drinking the electrolyte before bedtime. It may keep you awake the whole night and cause various health issues due to sleep disorders.
Do you lose electrolytes when you pee?
Yes. Most of the electrolyte in your body is lost due to excess sweating and urine. Less amount of liquid in the body causes dehydration. You have to drink the electrolyte water continuously during the physical workout to keep the electrolyte level sufficient to boost energy.
Muscle contraction could be experienced when you have fewer electrolytes in the body. Muscle pain, dry throat, decreased stamina, and dizziness is some of the symptoms sportspeople experience when they experience an excess amount of electrolyte loss.
How often should I drink electrolyte water?
Electrolyte drinks should not be consumed on a regular day. The water and food would be sufficient to offer you the electrolyte required to maintain the body on a typical day. It is unnecessary to drink electrolyte water or beverages when you are not doing any physical workout.
The person who is dealing with vomiting or diarrhea should drink electrolyte water. It will supplement the excess amount of fluid loss from your body. Also, the electrolyte water will protect you from dehydration during a hot environment.
Sports players use the electrolyte water during the game and workout session. The vital minerals in the water quickly replace the loss of fluid and minerals and keep you active all the time. It is estimated that the electrolyte water boosts your performance by 3% to 7% and gives you a power boost to stay alert.
Why do hydration drinks taste salty?
Hydration drink contains varieties of minerals and vitamins. The natural taste of these vita minerals is salty. When combined to produce a hydration drink, the water tastes like salted water.
However, not all the water made through this process turns salty; the taste of the water depends entirely on the number of ingredients mixed in the water.
Some hydration drink-producing brands use artificial sweeteners to reduce the effect of this salty ingredient. The water would have a salty taste, but overlapping sweaters would make the salty taste of the water go unnoticed.
A brand that doesn’t use artificial sweeteners would have a prominent salt taste. The salty taste doesn’t mean that the water has too salty. It will not affect your body and work the best to mitigate the effect of dehydration.
Why is liquid IV salty?
Salt is a vital ingredient in electrolyte drinks. Cellular transport technology utilizes sodium to make the electrolyte water.
It is combined with other minerals such as glucose, potassium sodium, increasing the water absorption quality in the body. Thus, it promotes the long-term energy supply and contributes to the performance boost.
Due high level of sodium content, the liquid becomes salty. However, the content is mixed in the moderated forum, so there will be no side effects of drinking the liquid IV.
Why is Pedialyte salty?
Pedialyte drinks contain sugar, potassium, water, and salt. The mixer includes the essential vitamins that boost energy. The salt in the mixer is dominating ingredient, which makes the water taste salty. The water helps the person to rehydrate the body.
Sugar in the mixer helps pull the salt and potassium, providing you with essential electrolytes to keep your body active. The lost minerals will be replaced with electrolytes, and dehydration will be mitigated immediately.",0.9430839419364929,1563,2.2501790523529053
"NDNC Agreement: Understanding the Basics of National Do Not Call Registry
The National Do Not Call (NDNC) registry is a tool designed to protect consumers against unsolicited calls from telemarketers. The registry is operated and maintained by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), and it is mandatory for all telemarketers in India to register with the NDNC registry before making unsolicited calls to customers.
The NDNC registry is an important mechanism that enables customers to control the number of unwanted telemarketing calls they receive, thereby giving them the freedom to communicate with only those telemarketers who are relevant to their needs and interests.
What is an NDNC Agreement?
An NDNC agreement is a legally binding contract between a telemarketing company and its customer, stating that the customer has opted out of receiving unsolicited calls from the company. This agreement is governed by the rules and regulations set forth by the TRAI to safeguard the interests of consumers.
When a customer signs an NDNC agreement, they are essentially stating that they do not wish to receive any telemarketing calls from the company, unless they have given their explicit consent to do so. This agreement is valid for a period of three years and can be renewed after the expiration of this period.
Understanding the Benefits of NDNC Agreements
For customers, NDNC agreements offer the following benefits:
1. Protection from unsolicited calls: By signing an NDNC agreement, customers can protect themselves from receiving unwanted telemarketing calls. This gives them the power to decide which telemarketing calls they want to receive and which they want to avoid.
2. Reduced spam calls: NDNC agreements help reduce the number of unsolicited calls that customers receive, which can help cut down on the amount of spam calls they receive each day.
3. Better relevance: By only communicating with telemarketers who are relevant to their needs and interests, customers can enjoy more meaningful interactions, which can lead to better purchasing decisions.
For telemarketing companies, NDNC agreements offer the following benefits:
1. Regulatory compliance: NDNC agreements ensure that telemarketing companies are in compliance with TRAI regulations and guidelines, which can help prevent legal action against them.
2. Better customer relations: By respecting customers` preferences and needs, telemarketing companies can build better relationships with their customers, which can lead to improved customer loyalty.
3. Higher efficiency: By communicating only with relevant customers, telemarketing companies can optimize their resources and improve their efficiency.
In conclusion, NDNC agreements are an essential tool for both customers and telemarketing companies in India. By respecting customers` preferences and needs, telemarketing companies can build better relationships with their customers, while customers can enjoy more meaningful interactions and better protection from unsolicited telemarketing calls. So, if you are tired of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls, signing an NDNC agreement may be the right solution for you.",0.9592598676681519,604,2.1403253078460693

"Functional Safety for Programmable Electronics Used in PPE: Best Practice Recommendations
Prepared by Safety Requirements, Inc. – NIOSH Contract 200-2003-02355
The objective of this contract was to establish and document recommendations for using a System Safety Approach to ensure the safe design and use of high-tech personal protective equipment throughout its complete life cycle. An analysis of failures associated with electronic safety equipment used by emergency responders illustrated the need to clarify performance requirements. The implementation of a System Safety Approach will ensure the safe design, manufacture, and use of PPE that contains embedded electronic hardware and software. In addition, these guidance documents will support the NFPA Electronic Safety Equipment (ESE) Technical Committee in developing standards by providing a means to assess and ensure the functional safety performance of ESE. This activity supports Strategic Goals 1 and 3, Reduce Exposure to Inhalation Hazards and Reduce Exposure to Injury Hazards. The integration of a System Safety Approach will ensure the safe design, manufacture, and use of PPE with embedded electronic hardware and software.
Manufacturers of PPE use electronics and software technology to improve the safety of emergency responders and increase the likelihood of survival of victims. Electronics and software components embedded in PPE now provide protection, monitoring, and communication functions for emergency responders.
For example, innovative electronics and software engineers are accepting the challenge to design PPE that reduce reliance on audible communications. These products use radio and cellular frequencies to communicate digital information to the unit commander and among the various emergency responder agencies present on scene (i.e., police, fire, and rescue).
Innovators are also embedding electronics in turnout gear and taking advantage of newer materials. The result is more complex products including those that integrate products developed by different manufacturers. Although use of electronics and software provides benefits, the added complexity, if not properly considered, may adversely affect worker safety.
Hazardous situations which require rapid and effective intervention by emergency personnel are growing in scope and complexity. Effective protection of emergency responders is an ever-increasing problem. Equipment used to provide protection for emergency responders will likely be designed and manufactured by a diverse group of suppliers; therefore, proper compatibility and interaction of the components to achieve an integrated, hybrid package is essential to system success and personnel safety. Ultimately, the PPE/support system worn by emergency responders will be an integrated package of components from a diverse group of manufacturers. Proper integration is the key, for instance, to ensure the compatibility and sufficiency of power supplies, computer controllers, component isolation and lack of inter-component interference, and failure mode contingencies. Thus, it is recognized that the systems design process will necessarily involve a heavy integration requirement, and the means to meet it, must be instilled in all component manufacturers early in the design process.
These commercial entities need a “roadmap” which helps guide them through the proper steps for ensuring that the best practices, as well an any impinging standards, are met. Since many of the processes may be new or unfamiliar to the manufacturers, an important issue is to determine the pitfalls, problems, and expected hurdles that must be overcome.
Programmable electronic components and software fail in ways that are not always detectable solely by pre-delivery functional and acceptance testing. At present, the existing safety standards that address the use of personal protection equipment do not sufficiently consider requirements for functional safety of the programmable electronics and software.
Specifically, reliance on programmable electronics and software requires that additional risk analysis, design for safety and other safety engineering practices be followed. To address potential failures for electronics and software, two consensus standards have emerged that are applied when electronics are used in safety applications. These standards are ANSI UL 1998 Standard for Software in Programmable Components and IEC 61508 Functional Safety: E/EE/PE Safety-Related Systems. The standards are based on the following reduced-risk engineering concepts:
- Safety Life Cycle
- Risk Analysis
- Design for Safety
- Verification, Validation, and Test
- Management of Change
- Development of a Safety File
These guidelines address the critical life-safety issues identified.
The report series contains best practice recommendations for the design and implementation of personal protection equipment and systems (PPE). The best practice recommendations apply to systems, protection layers, and devices using electronics and software embedded in or associated with PPE. The entire series provides information for use by life safety equipment manufacturers including component manufacturers, subassembly manufacturers, final equipment manufacturers, systems integrators, installers, and life safety professionals.",0.9201521277427673,921,2.3783199787139893
"‘We saw inhumanity close up’. What is gained by school students from Scotland visiting Auschwitz?
As the education for citizenship agenda continues to impact on schools in the UK and with the Holocaust Educational Trust (HET) in conjunction with the Scottish Government introducing its Lessons From Auschwitz (LFA) project for students and teachers in Scotland, this article focuses on the Scottish context and investigates the school processes by which students are chosen to participate in the LFA project, the impact the LFA project has on student personal growth, and the range of follow‐up activities in their schools and communities. The methodology employed online questionnaires and face‐to‐face interviews which were designed to ascertain student perceptions of the LFA project and the impact that this project had on student participants, their schools, and their communities. Findings demonstrate that the student cohort were highly academic students who took their responsibilities on return to their schools very seriously and organized a wide range of events, both in their schools and in their communities. There was clear evidence that the LFA project had led to extra teaching and awareness of the Holocaust, racism, and human rights; and that students’ citizenship values had been enhanced.

"Once you have your web host configured, you need to upload your website’s files or install your CMS software. The easiest way to do this is through File Transfer Protocol (FTP). FTP makes it so simple to send files to your hosting account. Alternatively, you can use the file manager included with your website control panel, but it has its limitations.
With FTP, you’ll be able to instantly send files to your server all at the same time as opposed to individually. The only catch is you have to download and install an FTP browser. But trust me, once you have this, you’ll never go back to your control panel file manager!
What is it?
FTP is a standard network protocol used only for transferring files. If you understand that HTTP is for transferring web documents like pictures, html files, sound, video, etc. then you can see the relation. It was created back in 1971 as a way to promote the sharing of files, computer programs and other data. It also streamlines the upload process by using multiple connection methods so the user doesn’t need to know what filesystem they’re connecting to; the software automatically detects it and makes applicable adjustments.
How does it work?
It utilizes a client-server configuration where a server has been setup on a remote site and the user connects to it via an IP address or domain name to begin a transfer session. More than likely, connecting to your server will require a connection to FTP.(yourdomain).COM using the port number: 21. Of course, different configurations will yield different settings.
Inherently, FTP is not secure and therefore, a user on the same network as the FTP session could use a packet sniffer program to see passwords, usernames and data as it’s being transferred. Today, FTP sessions can be used with the addition of an SSL certificate over the FTPS protocol. Most FTP software can also handle SSH connections.
You can even set up your own FTP server at home and have access to all of your files whenever you need them. I remember years ago (and long before torrents), FTP servers were the number one way to download software, although some of it wasn’t exactly legal!
What do I need?
For simply connecting to your webserver and uploading files, you only need one thing: FTP client software. Here’s a list of some of the most popular programs out there:
- Globalscape CuteFTP Pro – This is my favorite and I’ve used it for over 10 years. The Pro version is the way to go because it offers SFTP, FTPS, HTTPS and SSH connections. Normally it costs $59.99, but it’s worth it. However, I noticed they added an academic licensed version that you can buy for only $3!
- SmartFTP Pro – I haven’t used this one myself, but at only $49.99, its not a bad price. Again, I’d recommend the Pro version for the added security features. They also have an Ultimate edition that includes a terminal client. I wish CuteFTP Pro had this feature!
- BulletProof FTP – This recommendation really only made this list because I used BulletProof FTP Server for a number of years and I loved it. This program is only $34.95, but it can hold its own against the others in features.
Once you install your client of choice, all you have to do is plug in your server’s IP address or domain name, your username and password and you’re connected! You’ll instantly have access to the location of all your website files and you can begin uploading your content.
If you’re not sure about your server settings, contact your web host to get the applicable information.

"Cyberpunk in Asia: Reflections on Dystopia in a Time of Coronavirus
Virtual exhibition created by the students in ""English 217: Cyberpunk in Asia"" taught by Jerrine Tan, Visiting Lecturer in Global Anglophone Literature, Spring 2020
In collaboration with Ellen Alvord
Designed and edited by Nina Frank
In my English course titled, ""Cyberpunk in Asia,"" we examine why the modern genre of cyberpunk dystopias has often been associated with Asian cities, neon signs, and crowded bustling streets. Viewing films such as Blade Runner and reading novels including Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, we interrogate how historical and economic forces have shaped the way the future is imagined and why the place of that reckoning resonates with Asia today. Given that visual imagery is central to the themes of our course—which even has its own Instagram account—it seemed natural to collaborate with the Art Museum on campus.
Due to the unexpected circumstances of COVID-19, we were not able to visit the Museum in person, so instead, I collaborated with Museum staff to plan a two-part remote museum activity for my students. The first involved a close-looking activity with four artworks from the MHCAM collection selected for the way they resonated with our course themes, including works by Wayne Thiebaud, Michael Jacobson-Hardy, Livia Corona, and Jane Hammond. Students studied the images online, shared responses, and then reflected on each others' insights. I highlight their astute observations in two video conversations (part I and part II) with Ellen Alvord, as part of the MHCAM in Conversation series.
I titled the second remote assignment ""Pick One; Recommend One"" and gave them more autonomy to select their own images. Students were given access to the Five College museum collections database and told to select an artwork that reflected the theme ""Cyberpunk in Asia"" or ""Present Dystopias,"" as a way to think about our present moment. They were to write a 100-word label for their selected piece, offering description, analysis, and explanation on how it related to either theme. They then had to recommend a complementary piece of artwork. This could be from the internet, from Instagram, or a piece of art of their own creation such as a photograph, haiku, short poem, or drawing, for which they would also add a short write-up explaining how this piece connects to the first.
I was impressed by their insightful analyses and amazed at how creative and imaginative they were with the assignment. I hope you enjoy their selections and thoughtful commentary below.

The Cityscape and Vaporwave/Future Funk
by Haenah Lee '20
Diorama Map Tokyo by Sohei Noshino (SCMA) is an impossible cityscape made up of collaged photographs of various elements: skyscrapers, pedestrians, boats, trains, and roads. While the artwork title suggests that this is a depiction of Tokyo, many of the elements appear to be repeated or spliced from another city entirely. Various buildings have a surrounding sky that looks out of place amongst the rest of the cityscape. This artwork encapsulates the cyberpunk city aesthetic because of its cramped busyness, which is filled to the brim with people and metal.
My recommended image is a typical representation of music covers for Vaporwave/Future Funk, with aesthetics rooted in gridlike cyberpunk abstraction. It is a subgenre of music that utilizes synths, pop drums, and other electrical instruments. Vaporwave/Future Funk often “samples” or takes inspiration from 1970’s and 1980’s music from both the west and Japan, which gives it a certain urban “nostalgia” and lighthearted atmosphere. These subgenres of music try to achieve what Diorama Map Tokyo accomplishes, an aural aesthetic of a cyberpunk-esque cityscape.

Made of mother-of-pearl, this object is a gaming counter (Historic Deerfield) that was used to keep score. Wealthy English families ordered these from Chinese artists, often with their family motto in script, which became a sort of rallying cry before a game began. This particular work is engraved with ""VIXI LIBER ET MORIAR,"" which translates to ""I have lived free, and will die so."" Although it is a historic piece, I believe it serves as the inspiration for the intricate animations and graphics of video games in the Asian cyberpunk genre.
My recommended piece is a scene from the video game Detroit: Become Human where a player controls three androids, who are essentially slaves to their human owners with the goal of escaping bondage. The character on the right is an android named Markus, who takes care of a very famous elderly artist (left). The artist is one of the few humans who believes that androids are not just machines, but keys to a successful and bright future. When he asks Markus to paint something, Markus creates a perfect copy of the artist's work hanging in the studio. The artist then asks Markus to paint something original, allowing him to be creative, even though that is not in an android's program. This image depicts the moment that Markus realizes that despite being an android, he can live free, and would rather die so—connecting to the family motto from the gaming counter: ""I have lived free and will die so.""
Human in Posthuman Colors
by Sarah Cavar '20
In Ely Kim's digital print Paleo (Mead Art Museum), the artist reinvents a nineteenth-century artwork—Kikugawa Eizan’s Untitled (sumo parade)—by inverting colors in order to transform the traditional into the super-modern. The use of hyperpigmented and cyberpunk-associated colors, especially blue and green, carry the work from its sepia-origin to a near-posthuman space. Greenlit identical men sit meditatively accompanied by bright pink, unidentifiable organisms. The artist's use of color and shadow defamiliarize the figures. By inverting the colors of sumo parade, Kim suggests the ""future"" and ""past"" are not opposites, but mirror images produced by a consistent body of social relations and ethical concerns.
My recommended piece is Lace Shell (2016) by Lisa Wright. A heavy figure stands head bowed against a black background, with a black mask covering all but their eyes. The figure appears to be clothed but is covered entirely in glowing green lacework that looks like computer static. The lace covering the black mask contrasts with their eyes, which are looking at something out of frame. Like Ely Kim, Wright defamiliarizes the human body, taking an antiquated medium (lace) and catapulting it to a glowing, green future. The green-covered bow in the figure's hair suggests simultaneous anachronism and futurism, reimagining the human form in posthuman hues.
Homes Devoid of Humans
by Jia Hong '20
This photograph by David Goldblatt (UMCA) depicts an unfinished municipal housing project in the Lady Grey village of South Africa. The rows of identical clay houses are abandoned and are missing their rooftops and doors. The region looks arid and unforgiving and there are no traces of human habitation. The landscape's ghost-town like qualities remind me of a dystopia because it illustrates the great injustice done to the people of the Lady Grey village by the government—who failed them in seeing the project through. I'm thinking of the people that were meant to live in these homes. Now that we are in a time of quarantine—where do they go for shelter and security?
My recommended piece is a watercolor painting by Hong Kong based artist, Leung Yun Charm. The title, Serene Moment No. 3 is inspired by a local village in the inland Chinese province of Anhui. Charm’s work connects to the theme of “Present Dystopias” because it shows a similar stillness and eerie feeling as Goldblatt's photograph. Given that this painting is of a Chinese village, I'm reminded of the different struggles countries are facing while combating COVID-19. At the moment, China’s mandatory shelter-in-place is slowly being lifted, while the United States is ramping up restrictions. These artworks are like glimpses into the future for the rest of the world just starting to feel the effects of this pandemic.
City in the Rain
by Eun Young Kim '20
City in the Rain by Benton Spruance (MHCAM) illustrates the moment rain in a city has stopped, leaving the remaining puddles, which creates a glossy texture to the piece. Most of the buildings appear to be at a similar height, however, there are a few taller, more distinct buildings that might be historical landmarks or useful for referencing directions. There is a mixture of neon pink and yellow sheens that stretch across the buildings, extending in the distance that create an overall warm tone to the city. These colors also suggest a “cyberpunk aesthetic.” When I first saw this piece, I immediately thought of the movie Ghost in the Shell and how shots of rain in the city were often used as transitional scenes.
My recommendation for a complimentary artwork is a photograph I took last summer in Seoul. The sunset creates a pink and yellow hue enveloping the city, typical for a warm summer evening. At night, Seoul delivers a ""cyberpunk aesthetic"" with all of the flashing lights, crowds, and music. Although it wasn't raining on this particular day, if it was raining in the evening, it would have had the same visual effects as in City in the Rain. However, there is similarity in the scale of buildings in each image and although it is not pictured in my photo, there was a subway station on the far left corner that was a perfect reference point to meet friends.
Present Day Dystopia
by Lindsay Burcz '20
In Fate Descends Towards the River Leading Two Innocent Children by Jan Saudek (Mead Art Museum), a woman clothed in a slightly tattered white dress is walking with two unclothed children down a muddy path. The path is lined by transmission towers and in the distance there is a faint city skyline. The uncertainty and loneliness of the present day is reflected in the children. Although the three figures are standing together, they are isolated from the city that they are walking towards, much like we are while quarantining. The children are seemingly unaware of their destination, holding onto the woman’s hand to guide them into an uncertain future. Their lack of clothing and resources, is reminicent of the situation many find themselves today in our current dystopian-like world.
My artwork recommendation is Nocturno by Otto Piene which is part of a larger collection, entitled Fire Paintings, made between 1965 and 2009. Nocturno and Saudek's photograph have many similarities, despite being of two different mediums. The works share a monochromatic color palette that lends a melancholy tone. Both have a white focal point in the center of the composition that draws the eye. Like Saudek’s photograph, Nocturno can be interpreted as a representation of the dystopian conditions created by the current pandemic. The smudge in the middle of the painting is contained by black rings with only little smatterings of white that spread towards the top of the piece, resembling our current patterns of being stuck indoors and leaving only for small errands.
Up Up Up
by Jaey Yim '20
Utagawa Kunimasa IV's woodblock print ""Pavilion Above the Clouds"" (Ryounkaku kikai sugoroku) (Mead Art Museum), depicts Japan’s first skyscraper which had electric lights on every floor and Japan's first elevator. The second to seventh floors were filled with shops selling imported goods from all around the world. The eighth floor had a musical hall where western concerts were showcased. The tenth to twelfth floors were dedicated to an observatory where one could see the entirety of a new modern Japan forming during the Meiji period—a time where the exchange of trade and ideas with the west molded Japan.
Ryounkaku was touted as a symbol of modernity for tourists and visitors. It was described as a magical structure that continued into the clouds; the Korean name literally means that the building is so high that it exceeds the clouds. For people living in Tokyo, however, Ryounkaku was only slightly taller than their buildings. After many people had visited Ryounkaku and the hype died down, it was referred to instead as Junikai, meaning ""twelve steps.""
Technology enables us to reach unimaginable heights, which is why I recommend this photograph of a model using cables to stay suspended in the air. This photo makes me think of the elevators in Ryounkaku which employed gears, metal ropes, and pulleys to individually elevate people to higher floors. In the photograph, it looks as though she is climbing the building, which captures the continued desire to ascend to an elevated place while relying on technology.
Separation Anxieties As Urban Dystopia
by Bethany Powell '22
In Elliott Erwitt's photograph Lost Persons/Pasadena, 1963 (Mead Art Museum), a handwritten sign is posted on the chain-link fence that reads ""Lost Persons Area.” Underneath it, two women are standing on a bench with postures of frustration or impatience. Between them, a woman sits on the bench holding an infant. There's a feeling of isolation even though they're in close proximity. The lost sense of time and place in this photo comments on the contemporary realities of urban life. As cities become more populated and overdeveloped it's easy to lose one's indivuality or sense of self.
My recommended piece is the music video for the song ""Sing"" by the rock band My Chemical Romance. In the video, the band of protagonists are leaving the post-apocalyptic wastelands to rescue a child who has been kidnapped by an evil corporation. Dressed in bright clothes, the child contrasts with the sleek corporate environment, and remains curious and playful while the corporate workers wait tensely for the arrival of something sinister. When the child is finally reunited with the chaotic wasteland adventurers, the child's connection to humanity is restored.

"As the Australian government further improves its aged care system, ASAG Equity Release can provide support for Home Care.
The Australian aged care system is set up to allow senior Australians extra assistance, either in a residential facility or their own house.
While transitioning into residential aged care can be a necessary option for those who require round the clock medical attention, managing this may be an overwhelming experience for the person and their families.
Some vital decisions need to be made, such as taking into consideration the location and suitability of the facility, affordability of the fees that are payable and, whether moving into residential care is required. The recipient can stay in their home to receive these support services.
With the population in Australia now living longer than before, most people don’t enter residential care. They live in their own homes with some support from the government approved Home Care providers.
What is a Home Care Package?
A Home Care Package is a care and service that allows a person to live independently. The subsidies provided by the government (paid directly to the care provider) are based on an affordability and income test.
As everyone’s needs are not the same, they are categorised into four levels of requirements of Home Care Packages that range from Level 1 – Level 4.
The Impact of Federal Budget 2020 on Aged Care services
1 July 2014 — the government changed the way fees were calculated for aged care homes and Home Care Packages. These changes were made to reform the aged care system into a more affordable and sustainable one.
The following years also saw a nationally consistent process nationwide of assigning these packages to consumers and preparatory work. This supports the establishment of a single unified system for Home Care and aged care.
October 2020 — The Federal Budget allocated a further $1.6 billion to create an extra 23,000 Home Care packages to add to the 6,105 packages that were announced in July 2020.
Furthermore, an updated and nationally consistent process to the allocation of these packages is also helping people avoid significant waiting lists with multiple providers, prioritising based on personal needs and how long they have been waiting.
Using an Equity Release for In-Home Care
November 2020 — RMIT released a research report on funding ageing in place, which indicates that 90% of senior Australians want to remain in their homes if possible, however, 29% cannot afford to.
Even with a subsidised Home Care package, the age pension may not be enough to cover the costs associated with care. This is where an Equity Release could help those homeowners who need to access further funds for specialised care at home.
An ASAG Equity Release could allow you to access the funds required for in Home Care without having to sell.
ASAG – providing further support
We at ASAG understand how important the family home is. Our Equity Release can help Australian seniors access their home’s equity to fund a more comfortable retirement without selling.
It’s our commitment to enable senior Australians to age in place if they prefer to. To further support this, ASAG is pleased to inform you that our Equity Release can provide support. Funds can be assessed as regular advances or in cash reserve to draw down on request — providing further flexibility to Equity Release.
An ASAG Equity Release can also be used to fund the construction of a granny flat — subject to our usual loan criteria, such as age, location, and valuation.

"The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, was established on 8 August 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand, with the signing of the ASEAN Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) by the Founding Fathers of ASEAN, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Brunei Darussalam then joined on 7 January 1984, Viet Nam on 28 July 1995, Lao PDR and Myanmar on 23 July 1997, and Cambodia on 30 April 1999, making up what is today the ten Member States of ASEAN.

2. To promote regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice and the rule of law in the relationship among countries of the region and adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter;
3. To promote active collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest in the economic, social, cultural, technical, scientific and administrative fields;

2. The right of every State to lead its national existence free from external interference, subversion or coercion;
3. Non-interference in the internal affairs of one another;
4. Settlement of differences or disputes by peaceful manner;
5. Renunciation of the threat or use of force; and

"The landscape of education in Southeast Asia is rapidly evolving, driven by government initiatives and collaborative efforts across ASEAN member states. One key driver in this transformation is the pursuit of “Apa Program Pemerintah Untuk Memajukan Pendidikan Di Asean,” which translates to “government APA programs to advance education in ASEAN.” These programs represent a multifaceted approach to elevating educational standards, fostering regional cooperation, and equipping students with the skills necessary to thrive in the globalized world.
While the specific acronym “APA” might not directly correspond to a universally recognized program across all ASEAN nations, it signifies the commitment of governments in the region to prioritize education through various initiatives. Understanding the spirit of “APA” requires exploring the individual and collective efforts undertaken by ASEAN governments to propel the education sector forward.
ASEAN’s Shared Vision for Education
At the heart of these endeavors lies a shared vision for a more integrated and prosperous ASEAN community. This vision recognizes education as a cornerstone for achieving economic growth, social progress, and regional competitiveness.
To materialize this vision, ASEAN has formulated several blueprints and frameworks that guide member states in harmonizing their education systems and promoting regional cooperation. These include the ASEAN Work Plan on Education, the ASEAN Qualifications Reference Framework (AQRF), and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community Blueprint 2025.
Key Focus Areas of Government Initiatives
While each ASEAN member state tailors its education programs to address specific national contexts, several common themes emerge in their initiatives. These include:
- Enhancing Access to Quality Education: Governments are investing heavily in expanding access to quality education at all levels, particularly in underserved communities. This involves building new schools, improving infrastructure, and providing scholarships and financial assistance to disadvantaged students.
- Promoting Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET): Recognizing the demand for skilled labor in the rapidly evolving job market, ASEAN governments are prioritizing TVET to equip individuals with practical skills aligned with industry needs.
- Strengthening Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education: In the face of technological advancements and a growing digital economy, ASEAN nations are placing significant emphasis on strengthening STEM education to foster innovation and equip students with 21st-century skills.
Cross-Border Collaboration and Partnerships
Recognizing that education transcends national boundaries, ASEAN governments are actively engaged in cross-border collaborations and partnerships to enhance educational outcomes. These partnerships take various forms, including:
- Student and Faculty Exchange Programs: These programs facilitate the exchange of knowledge, cultures, and perspectives among ASEAN member states, fostering a sense of regional identity and promoting understanding.
- Joint Research and Development Initiatives: ASEAN governments are collaborating on research projects to address common challenges in the education sector and develop innovative teaching methodologies.
- Sharing of Best Practices and Resources: Platforms for dialogue and knowledge sharing allow ASEAN countries to learn from each other’s successes and challenges in implementing educational reforms.
Challenges and Opportunities
While ASEAN governments have made significant strides in advancing education, challenges remain. These include:
- Bridging the Digital Divide: Ensuring equitable access to technology and digital literacy remains a pressing concern, particularly in rural and remote areas.
- Upskilling and Reskilling the Workforce: As technology rapidly transforms industries, governments face the challenge of continuously upskilling and reskilling the workforce to meet evolving labor market demands.
- Securing Sustainable Funding for Education: Sustaining investments in education and exploring innovative financing mechanisms is crucial to ensure long-term growth and development in the sector.
Looking Ahead: A Brighter Future for ASEAN Education
The pursuit of “apa program pemerintah untuk memajukan pendidikan di asean” reflects a deep commitment to empowering future generations and securing a brighter future for the region. By continuing to invest in quality education, fostering collaboration, and embracing innovation, ASEAN governments are paving the way for a more prosperous, inclusive, and interconnected Southeast Asia.
1. What are some examples of specific education initiatives by ASEAN governments?
Each ASEAN nation has its programs, such as Indonesia’s “Merdeka Belajar” (Freedom to Learn) or Singapore’s “SkillsFuture” initiative. These programs reflect the diverse needs and priorities of each country while aligning with the broader ASEAN education goals.
2. How does the ASEAN Qualifications Reference Framework (AQRF) benefit students?
The AQRF facilitates the recognition of educational qualifications across ASEAN countries. This makes it easier for students to pursue higher education or employment opportunities within the region, enhancing regional mobility and integration.
3. How can I learn more about scholarship opportunities for ASEAN students?
The ASEAN Secretariat website and the education ministries of individual ASEAN countries are valuable resources for exploring scholarship opportunities. Additionally, organizations like the SEAMEO (Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization) offer various scholarship programs for students in the region.

"One of our favorite things to do here at Ashford Manor is to have the puppies participate in an agility course. You might be thinking to yourself, “There is no way I could set up a course in my home. It is too small and I don’t have the right equipment.” Well, put those doubts behind you because we are sharing with you simple ways to make your very own agility course! A basic agility course has the following types of obstacles: weave poles, dog-walk, standard jumps, pause table, tunnel, tire jump, and or teeter board. Not all of these are required or needed to have a good course.
To make your own tunnel, think back to your childhood where you made tents out of blankets: attach (make sure it is secure so it doesn’t fall on the puppy) blankets to chairs to create a tunnel. Have your puppy wait at one end while you go to the other. As you look through the tunnel call your puppy! When he reaches you reward him with a treat! Continue to play!
Instead of weave poles, use different items around your house that he can run through, piles of books, pillows, etc.
These are just two of the many ways you can create a fun indoor agility course for your puppy. If you would like to read more check out the following websites:
We would love to see your Australian Labradoodle completing his course! Please send pictures to firstname.lastname@example.org with the subject Indoor Agility Course.

There’s nothing more sickening than being approved for a 29% car loan, or only qualifying for an 8% private mortgage. I cannot stress enough the importance of rebuilding your credit history after a major event like bankruptcy or consumer proposal. It’s just as true if you have recently paid off your bad debts some other way – like through a debt management plan or a consolidation loan.
So many people vow to live without credit after one of these harrowing life events, and that is a big mistake. Or they never get around to doing it properly. Maybe they apply to Capital One and are granted a $300 secured credit card, and they heave a sigh of relief. Well that’s a start, but it’s not nearly enough.
Why you should rebuild your credit score
In this day and age, you cannot avoid the need for a healthy credit history. Landlords request permission to access your credit report. If you are buying or leasing a car, they will check your credit. If you wish to sign a cell phone contract, or if you need a mortgage, your credit report will loom large. Some employers even insist on seeing your credit history before issuing an offer of employment.
Surely it’s a lost cause?
No that is not true. Yes, time is your friend – the more space between you and your bad debts, the better your report will look. In fact, in Ontario, three years after completing your consumer proposal, the fact you were even in one will drop off your report. And in the case of a bankruptcy, it will take six years.
But what matters now is “what have you done lately?” Are you a reformed citizen? Have you accessed credit since the bankruptcy and have you demonstrated an ability to service and repay the new debt each month?
Your score will begin to increase within a few months of accessing new credit. And within a year or two, you will actually have a reasonable chance to secure a mortgage or arrange a car loan at less than disgusting interest rates. However, it is very unlikely any creditor will grant you unsecured credit of any magnitude until the bad information has completely disappeared from your credit report.
How to rebuild your credit score
In a perfect world, you need at least two new active trade lines – credit facilities that have been arranged since your bankruptcy or proposal. If you had a car lease or loan during the entire process, that may count as one. Same with a student loan.
If you had a mortgage during the process, only a few lenders actually report your payment history to the credit bureaus – so you should not assume this will count as one. (Home Equity Lines of Credit are reported in most cases; traditional mortgages are not – Scotiabank being a notable exception.)
Try to arrange two credit cards from major chartered banks. The bank you deal with on a daily basis may even give you an unsecured card – the limit will likely be only $500 to $1,000. But regardless, this is so important that I suggest you offer up a security deposit for these new cards. Don’t ask any bank that was included in your original debt load – they will be less welcoming.
In a perfect world, these two new cards would ultimately have a credit limit of at least $2,000. But just do the best you can to get started. It’s better to have two $500 cards, than one for $1,000. Later you can offer to increase the security deposit (and the associated credit limit) when you feel more power.
If your circumstances are such that even this door is closed to you, then yes try Capital One, Home Trust, or Peoples Trust. Stay away from reloadable or prepaid credit cards – they will do nothing for your credit score.
Some people arrange one new credit card, and perhaps a small loan from their bank too. It could be an RRSP loan, or a car loan, or it may even be secured against your own money – like a one year GIC say. Pay the loan off as quick as you can (6 to 12 months) and this too will help rebuild your credit.
Retail store credit cards are better than nothing – but not much – don’t go overboard on these.
When can I start this?
Most advisers will tell you to wait until you receive your discharge from bankruptcy or at least six months into your consumer proposal. But I would suggest you start even sooner – the sooner the better. Of course, you should (you must) disclose to the new credit card issuer your present state, but you can honestly tell them you are working overtime to reform and part of your reformation is to rebuild your credit history as quickly as possible.

On Friday April 7th, our plant in Morris, IL was asked to host a Spring Meeting for our Commercial Motor Vehicle Operators (CMV). The goals were to review and discuss safety and compliance topics for the upcoming construction season to ensure a safe and successful start to the construction season here in the Midwest.
CMV Operators from Edison, OH and Indianapolis, IN were also able to attend this important meeting. Everyone participated in a presentation put together by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT). The presentation reviewed HazMat safety, FMCSA regulations, and Roadside Inspections with MCSAP Compliance Officer Wesley James.
“It was so important, and also exciting to see our team engaging with the IDOT reps. The team was able to ask questions to understand how they can take their knowledge and skills and transform them into every task to maintaining compliance and safety standards!” – Samantha Komperda, Logistics Manager
The IDOT presentation was followed by a hands-on inspection of the drivers’ equipment at the Morris site. Officer James completed a full Roadside Inspection, explaining every step of the process. The team was able to hear IDOT explain the items they look for during an inspection step by step, and openly shared tips and ideas about how to review their equipment during their own inspections to ensure it is consistently adhering to compliance standards.
This is one of the many ways our organization approaches safety and invests in creating a culture where knowledge, best practices and shared learnings are welcomed and accessible.

"Junko Takai’s dedication to providing products that make a difference rests on a conservative fiscal foundation.
By Sigrid Tornquist
“Sometimes when companies make a lot of money, they invest that money into stocks—they invest profits into something other than their own businesses—
we reinvest our profits into our core business,” says Junko Takai, president of Hivix Co. Ltd. in Mizuho-city, Gifu, Japan. Takai began working at Hivix, a company manufacturing inflatable products for the healthcare, sports and industrial industries, sixteen years ago. She began working in purchasing and information technology, and in 2001 became president of the company.
Safeguarding the company’s interests is as important to Takai as it was to her father, who preceded her as president of Hivix. In fact, it was her father who taught her the value of reinvesting profits back into the company. “In Japan, about 10 or 15 years ago, we had a [financial] crisis,” Takai says. “Other companies ended up in trouble, but because of my father, Hivix didn’t.” Her father resisted the conventional wisdom of investing profits elsewhere, and during the Japanese stock market crash of the early 1990s, the company remained stable. Takai feels strongly about the wisdom of this kind of conservative fiscal approach to business. “Because of my father’s handling of the business, we can keep it for other generations so they can take over,” Takai says.
Takai balances her conservative fiscal approach with the belief that in order for the business to flourish, its leaders need to entertain the need for change, and look for the best places to make those changes. The company, then called Hioki Vinyl Co. Ltd., started as a vinyl manufacturing facility in 1951, offering products, including rain coats and umbrellas. The company name was changed to Hivix in 1990 at around the same time that it expanded its product line to include inflatable medical/healthcare, sports and industrial products.
Predicting customer needs
The decision to include medical and healthcare products to the company’s product line was far from incidental; it emerged out of personal experience—experience that revealed to Takai’s family a need that their company had the ability to meet. When Takai’s grandmother experienced a stroke that left her unable to care for herself, the duty and honor of caring for her fell to the family—and Takai and her mother realized firsthand the difficulties that accompany being a caregiver. “My mother worked very hard to take care of my grandmother,” Takai says. “I would help, so I know just how hard it is for the patient and for the family or caregivers. We decided then that we wanted to make something to reduce the burden [of caregiving] for people.”
That “something to reduce the burden” turned out to be inflatable products for healthcare needs, including air-pressure mattresses to help prevent bedsores, post-operative air pressure leggings to prevent blood clots, and inflatable basins for giving bed baths.
The company also produces inflatable sporting goods and industrial products, and Takai is dedicated to making sure the company stays on the leading edge of technology and product development for all their products, beginning with design. “We develop designs with our customers.” Takai says. She points out, however, that sometimes customers give them a drawing for a product that just wouldn’t meet the demands of the application, when taking into account points of pressure and flexibility requirements. But the designers work with the customers to come to a solution that satisfies their expectations and performs to the company’s standards. “As far as I know, we are the only company in Japan that can work to develop designs with our customers [for these types of products],” Takai says.
The process of finding fabric that meets the specifications for the end product is an ongoing challenge, according to Takai. “We don’t buy standard material from suppliers; we always order custom-made,” she says. “We are always thinking about how to work with fabric suppliers to design materials so the content of the material will fit the application.”
At times, new materials call for new welding techniques. Currently, Hivix uses mostly RF welding, but also uses heat-sealing welding depending upon the application. Finding the appropriate welding process for each application can be difficult, according to Takai, and she expects the market to continue to expand. “Welding is a challenge,” she says. “Each type of welding has its limitations, and with new materials coming out, we will need different [welding] machines to do the job.” Takai traveled to Charlotte, N.C., in the United States in October to attend IFAI Expo 2008 for this purpose—to explore the latest fabric innovations and welding options that could be used in her company’s products.
For Takai, exploring timely options extends beyond innovations in fabric and machinery. She recently traveled to Viet Nam to consider if opening a manufacturing plant there could reduce costs while maintaining product quality. “We researched costs in shipping the materials from Japan, labor costs, land, electricity, etc.,” Takai says. “Even though labor costs are lower there, considering all the expenses involved, we decided at this time not to pursue opening a plant in Viet Nam.”
Thirty years earlier, her father faced a similar decision: to move manufacturing to China as so many other companies were doing or keep production in Japan. He, like Takai, decided on the latter. It is a cautious and thoughtful approach, exploring the options, weighing the risk and proceeding in a manner that will protect the business capital.
“I want to do my part to keep this company going for the next hundred years,” she says.",0.9687114357948303,1259,1.3985285758972168
"(CNN) — As Europe plans its gradual reopening to website visitors from even further afield, the struggle traces are staying drawn among places eager to get the vacationer dollars flowing.

Capri, in the Gulf of Naples, is generally regarded for its upscale visitors. But this yr, instead of pitching its luxurious inns and glorious sea sights, the authorities are going for a significantly simpler sale: that every island resident has been vaccinated.

In 2020, Capri’s tourist sector noticed a 70% dip in turnover, thanks to the pandemic, claims Gargiulo. It is a devastating determine for a vacation spot that depends so intensely on tourism.
But the authorities imagine that the island has significantly to give — specially at a time of social distancing.
“In addition to the better known sites, and the renowned ‘piazzetta’ wherever absolutely everyone satisfies, Capri presents amazing character trails suited for the pandemic,” states Ludovica Di Meglio, head of Capri’s tourism department.
Luigi Esposito, a tutorial specializing in out of doors excursions on the island, says that though Capri is acknowledged for upscale tourism, its outside trails are a important emphasize.
“Capri is not just the baths and the worldliness. Even visitors of five-star lodges really like to wander — I take them to discover the top secret destinations of the island,” he claims.

Capri isn’t really the only island to stage up its vaccination campaign ahead of the summer season time. Its neighbor in the Gulf of Naples, Procida — which will be Italian Cash of Culture for 2022 — finished all vaccinations numerous days in advance of Capri.
Ischia, the other island in the Gulf, is because of to full its very own method shortly, states De Luca.
Italy has roughly 30 small islands which go from staying fairly uninhabited to vacationer hotspots each and every summer months. Most have limited healthcare, and the Italian authorities has approved mass vaccination designs for them.
The concentrate on the islands has not long gone unnoticed by these in other tourist destinations. Guides in holiday honeypots such as Venice, Florence and Cinque Terre will not get vaccination precedence.
“They question me: ‘Why you are absolutely vaccinated and we aren’t?’ And I reply that, without seeking to discredit anybody, Capri is acknowledged all about the planet, it has better visibility. Owning Capri Covid-free is a earn-gain for anyone,” says Esposito.
Talking at a meeting of the G20 tourism ministers previously this month, Italian Primary Minister Mario Draghi introduced that forward of a European “inexperienced certificate,” Italy would start its very own tourist go by mid-May well.
Currently, all visitors to Italy should quarantine for a minimal of five days, but with the go, self-isolation would be waived for vaccinated tourists and people who have experienced Covid-19 in the past six months.
As of May well 10, about 24 million vaccination shots have been administered in Italy, with just about 12% of the population totally vaccinated.

"Overview of Eyewear Trends in the UK
The UK eyewear market is rapidly evolving, driven by a blend of fashion eyewear influences and shifting consumer preferences. New trends emerge, influenced heavily by major events such as fashion weeks, and the style updates put forth by celebrities. These often set the stage for what’s considered fashionable in eyewear, making such spectacles not just a necessity but a style statement.
Fashion eyewear enthusiasts closely follow these events to stay updated on what’s trending. For instance, oversized frames have gained popularity as they offer both a bold aesthetic and practicality in sun protection. Additionally, colour-tinted lenses are in vogue, providing a retro look reminiscent of the 70s.
There’s also a significant shift towards sustainable and ethical eyewear. Consumers are increasingly demanding eco-friendly materials in their eyewear, reflecting a broader societal push towards sustainability. Options like frames made from recycled ocean plastics or biodegradable acetate are becoming more prevalent, appealing to the environmentally conscious buyer.
Thus, understanding eyewear trends entails not only recognising style updates but also considering the materials and ethical practices behind them. The intersection of fashion eyewear dynamics and sustainability is setting a new standard for the increasing demand in the UK market.
Popular Eyewear Styles
In recent years, trending eyewear styles have become an essential part of personal fashion. The allure of fashion glasses and designer sunglasses extends beyond functionality, offering a glimpse into one’s personality and style.
Trendsetters and fashion enthusiasts often gravitate towards oversized and bold frames. These distinctive eyewear options are characterised by their daring designs and vibrant colours. They serve as an excellent means to make a fashion statement and are ideal for social events or professional settings where your style can shine. By combining unique patterns with eye-catching shapes, statement frames can transform an ordinary look into an unforgettable ensemble. Thus, selecting the right statement eyewear becomes an expression of self-assurance and individuality.
Retro and Vintage Styles
Retro and vintage eyewear styles are making a substantial comeback, particularly those reminiscent of the 90s and 2000s. With distinct features such as round lenses and tortoiseshell patterns, these styles resonate with nostalgia while maintaining modern appeal. Popular brands are increasingly embracing vintage aesthetics, reflecting a desire to merge past and present trends seamlessly. By incorporating these distinctive themes, retro eyewear allows for diverse expressions of flair and uniqueness, catering to both old souls and contemporary fashion lovers alike.
Leading Eyewear Brands in the UK
In the realm of eyewear brands within the UK, a clear distinction emerges between established giants and emerging independent brands that are swiftly gaining traction. Among the renowned luxury designer eyewear names, Ray-Ban, Gucci, and Tom Ford maintain their stronghold with offerings that balance style and quality. These top glasses brands have built a legacy over the years, providing both timeless designs and the latest fashion-forward innovations.
In contrast, the eyewear market has seen the rise of independent brands such as Cubitts and Ace & Tate, which appeal to consumers looking for unique pieces and sustainable practices. These brands attract a different consumer demographic by emphasizing distinctive designs and a less conventional approach to marketing.
Several factors influence the choice of eyewear among UK consumers. Price, brand heritage, the exclusivity of design, and sustainability efforts are all crucial considerations. Additionally, the shift towards personalised optical care and the ability to offer tailor-made solutions have made some brands more appealing. As consumer preferences evolve, both established and burgeoning brands need to adapt to maintain market relevance. The continuous blend of tradition and modernity plays a pivotal role in shaping these choices.
Functional Features of Modern Eyewear
In today’s rapidly evolving landscape of functional eyewear, remarkable advancements in lens technology and adaptive eyewear are transforming how we see the world. These cutting-edge technologies not only enhance visual clarity but also prioritize ocular health.
Modern lenses incorporate advanced features like blue light blocking, which helps mitigate eye strain from prolonged use of digital devices, and essential UV protection to defend against harmful solar rays. In sunglasses, polarization technology significantly reduces glare, providing clearer vision, especially in intense sunlight conditions. For those with an active lifestyle, emerging lens technologies are a game-changer. These include lenses that transition seamlessly from bright light to shade and offer enhanced durability and scratch resistance, ensuring unparalleled performance and protection.
Adaptive eyewear is revolutionizing prescription glasses with innovations that integrate seamlessly into our lives. Smart glasses are a standout, merging connectivity with functionality, allowing users to manage notifications and calls while also offering traditional vision correction. Trends also show increasing emphasis on versatile eyewear designed to suit varying environmental needs—from photochromic lenses, which automatically adjust to different light conditions, to eyewear that adapts to humidity and temperature fluctuations. These advancements reflect a shift towards eyewear that not only enhances vision but is tailored to individual lifestyles and the modern world’s diverse demands.
Where to Buy Trending Eyewear
Navigating the world of eyewear retailers can be daunting, especially when seeking the latest trends. In the UK, several online platforms offer a vast array of fashionable glasses. These platforms are user-friendly, allowing customers to easily browse and buy glasses without leaving the comfort of home. When considering where to buy trendy eyewear online, Eyewearbrands and Glasses Direct are popular choices. They boast expansive collections that feature both classic styles and the latest trends.
For those who prefer a more tactile shopping experience, local boutiques in significant UK cities are worth exploring. These boutiques often showcase unique and designer pieces, providing options not found in standard retail outlets. Visiting a local store allows you to try on glasses and receive personalized styling advice, ensuring a perfect fit.
Before purchasing, it’s crucial to consider how the eyewear fits. Many online retailers now offer virtual try-on tools, which use augmented reality to simulate how different frames will look on your face. This innovative feature is especially helpful in ensuring your comfort and style preferences are met before making a purchase. Additionally, consulting with an optician can offer insights into finding the ideal pair tailored to your prescription and facial features.
Style Tips for Wearing Eyewear
Discovering the right eyewear styling tips can elevate your fashion game significantly. When it comes to accessorizing with glasses, choosing a pair that aligns effortlessly with your outfit is key. This isn’t just beauty for beauty’s sake; it involves harmony and balance that enhances your overall appearance.
Pairing Eyewear with Outfits
Pairing the right eyewear styles with different clothing genres can transform your look. Consider sleek, minimalist frames for a classic, professional wardrobe. Conversely, round, more colourful frames can work wonders with casual outfits, adding a touch of flair and personality.
Accessories play a crucial role in complementing eyewear. A matching belt or jewellery can tie the ensemble together, ensuring a cohesive appearance. Furthermore, the seasonal style adjustments for eyewear can vary—light, pastel shades in spring and summer, whereas darker tones can be appealing during autumn and winter.
Confidence in Eyewear
Having confidence while wearing stylish glasses means selecting frames that enhance your facial features. For instance, angular faces may benefit from round frames to offer balance. The psychological effect of such successful accessorizing breeds confidence and ensures a standout presence. Over time, building a personal eyewear collection allows for versatile styling options every day.",0.9173514246940613,1574,1.4471207857131958

Understanding the S22’s Audio Jack Situation
Before we dive into the basics of using wired earphones with S22, let’s address the elephant in the room – the absence of a traditional audio jack. Samsung, like many other smartphone manufacturers, has ditched the traditional 3.5mm audio jack in favor of USB-C audio.

Can I use any wired earphones with my Samsung S22?
You can use most wired earphones with your Samsung S22, but it’s essential to ensure that they are compatible with the phone’s audio jack. The S22 uses a standard 3.5mm audio jack, which is the same as most Android devices. However, it’s still important to check the earphones’ compatibility before making a purchase.
If you’re unsure about the compatibility, you can check the earphones’ packaging or manufacturer’s website for more information. Additionally, you can also look for earphones that are specifically designed for Samsung devices or have a universal fit. This will ensure that the earphones fit snugly into the audio jack and provide high-quality audio output.
Do I need to use a special adapter to connect my wired earphones to the S22?
No, you do not need a special adapter to connect your wired earphones to the S22. The phone has a standard 3.5mm audio jack, which is the same as most Android devices. This means you can plug in your wired earphones directly into the phone without the need for any adapters or converters.
However, if you have earphones with a non-standard connector, such as a USB-C connector, you may need an adapter to convert the connector to a standard 3.5mm audio jack. Additionally, if you want to connect your earphones to a computer or other device, you may need an adapter for that specific connection.
Will using wired earphones with my S22 affect the audio quality?
Using wired earphones with your S22 will not affect the audio quality. In fact, wired earphones are known to provide better audio quality compared to wireless earphones. This is because wired earphones do not compress the audio signal, which can result in a loss of quality. Additionally, wired earphones do not have latency issues, which can cause a delay between the audio and video.
The S22 also supports high-quality audio codecs such as Hi-Res Audio and Dolby Atmos, which can provide an immersive audio experience when used with compatible earphones. To get the best audio quality, make sure to use high-quality earphones that are designed to take advantage of these audio codecs.
Can I use my wired earphones with other devices besides the S22?
Yes, you can use your wired earphones with other devices besides the S22. Wired earphones are designed to be universal and can be used with any device that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack. This means you can use your earphones with other Android devices, iPhones, tablets, laptops, and even desktop computers.
However, keep in mind that the audio quality may vary depending on the device you’re using. Some devices may not support high-quality audio codecs, which can affect the audio quality. Additionally, some devices may have different audio settings that may need to be adjusted to get the best audio quality.
Are wired earphones better than wireless earphones?
Wired earphones have some advantages over wireless earphones. One of the main advantages is that they do not require batteries, which means you don’t have to worry about them running out of power in the middle of use. Additionally, wired earphones do not have latency issues, which can cause a delay between the audio and video.
Wired earphones also tend to be more affordable than wireless earphones and do not require any additional setup or pairing. However, wireless earphones have their own advantages, such as convenience and portability. Ultimately, the choice between wired and wireless earphones depends on your personal preferences and needs.
How do I care for my wired earphones to ensure they last long?
To care for your wired earphones, make sure to handle them with care and avoid tangling the cables. When not in use, wrap the cables neatly and store them in a protective case. Avoid exposing the earphones to water or extreme temperatures, which can damage the components.
Regularly clean the earphones with a soft cloth and avoid using harsh chemicals or liquids. Additionally, check the earphones regularly for any signs of wear and tear, such as frayed cables or worn-out earbuds. If you notice any damage, consider replacing the earphones to ensure optimal audio quality and safety.
What are some popular brands of wired earphones that are compatible with the S22?
There are many popular brands of wired earphones that are compatible with the S22. Some of the top brands include Sony, Sennheiser, Audio-Technica, and Shure. These brands offer a range of wired earphones with different features, such as noise cancellation, water resistance, and Hi-Res Audio support.
When choosing a brand, consider your budget, audio preferences, and intended use. For example, if you’re looking for earphones for exercise, look for brands that offer sweat-resistant and waterproof earphones. If you’re looking for earphones for critical audio listening, look for brands that offer Hi-Res Audio support and accurate sound reproduction.",0.9178264141082764,2336,1.3591325283050537

"Al Hanson, Army Air Corps, WW II (Interviewed Aug. 31, 2005) It was on Al and Ruby Hanson's backyard porch that Tom Turbiville first started his passion for telling the story of Brazos Valley Veterans. Al Hanson was a radio operator of the 55th troop carrier squadron US Army Air Corps. He lost count of how many air missions he flew in World War II -- his craft delivering supplies to the troops on practically every island of the Pacific Campaign.
Al Rampmeier, U.S. Army, Vietnam (Interviewed Feb. 8, 2007) Al Rampmeier served under Gen. Hal Moore. Moore was the officer depicted in the film “We Were Soldiers”, and wrote the book it was based on. His is a remarkable story of service as a member of the military police.
Albert Novak, Army/Navy/Air Force, WW II (Interviewed July 26, 2007) Albert Novak served his country in three services, the Army, Navy and Air Force. As a machinist aboard the USS Wasp for two years during World War II, Albert Novak recalls that day in March of 1945, when a 500-pound bomb hit the WASP. He was one of 150 injured, fortunately not one of the 100 who died that day. He was born and raised in Bryan, Texas. (Note: Albert Novak was in the advanced stages of Pancreatic cancer when we recorded the interview and passed away less that 2 months later)
Alfred “Whitey” Birdwell, U.S. Army, WW II Interviewed May 27, 2010 Alfred “Whitey” Birdwell was a Sherman tank driver in World War II's European Theater, after D-Day, but during the final push and in the Battle of the Bulge and until victory in Europe. He was overseas just more than a year but probably covered more miles per day served than just about anyone. He vividly recalls when he drove the first American tank over the Rhine River for the 3rd Armoured to spearhead. A Purple Heart recipient, he drove a tank every day except for those 10 days he was laid up because of shrapnel wounds.
Col Alton Meyer, Air Force, Vietnam P.O.W. (A&M Class of ‘60) (Interviewed Sept. 28, 2005) It was six years of life he will never get back but Lt. Col. Al Meyer of rural College Station will certainly never forget that time from the Spring of 1967 to 1973 that he spent as a captive of the North Vietnamese Army -- a P.O.W. Sitting in the back seat of his F-105, he was shot out of the sky. His pilot didn’t survive. His wife Bobbie didn’t know for three years that he was alive at the Hanoi Hilton, as the prison camp was called. It’s an amazing story of physical and mental victory.
Anne Boykin, Project Hold (Interviewed 2008) This is a very interesting program with then Director of College Station’s Project HOLD, Anne Boykin. She brought with her several photos from the Project HOLD collection, those that reflected the military commitment in the Brazos Valley and at Texas A&M. The photos are all described in the TV Show. Anne Boykin has been a great supporter and helper for the development of Veterans of the Valley.
Arnold Foltermann, U.S. Army, WW II (Interviewed Nov. 15, 2006) Arnold Foltermann and his wife Minnie were married some 60 years and worked for the phone company after he served in Gen. Patton’s 3rd Army during World War II. He saw action at the Battle of the Bulge in Europe. Just a “doughboy”, fighting for his country.
Bill Adams, U.S. Air Force, Korea (Interviewed March 3, 2011) Bill Adams wanted to be in the Air Force in 1950 but really had no designs on being a mechanic. But that where the Air Force needed him so he learned the craft and for the next four years kept B-29s in the air. Not in frigid Korea where the war was going on but among other places in steaming hot Saudi Arabia. Bill Adams is one of those many veterans who served his country not in combat but in still needed jobs that kept America safe
Bill Hamilton, U.S. Army, Vietnam Era Interviewed Dec. 13, 2006 Bill Hamilton is a veteran who did not serve in any overseas combat, but the battle he fought since January 1980 is one that he wins every day. He's a volunteer and an assistant chaplain of the Disabled American Veterans. He sings and writes poems and you'll understand how he turned a personal nightmare into hope and faith. Meet Sergeant Bill Hamilton, Vietnam veteran.
Bill Harper, Operation Ivy, Post WW II (Interviewed Oct. 10, 2010) Bill Harper does not have any real war stories to tell from his two hitches and more than five years in military service, but the one that he does tell is indeed a witness to history. November 1st, 1952, from the deck of the USS Estes near Eniwetok Island in the Marshall Islands, Bill Harper was one of those who watched the result of “Operation Ivy” -- the very first Hydrogen Bomb Explosion. Bill Harper has never discussed his specific duties in regard to Operation Ivy, and he never will. But he can describe in detail the incredible site and effect of the detonation of a bomb some 500 times more powerful than the Atomic Bomb that ended World War II some seven years earlier. And there are other fascinating stories to tell... like how he got to Texas by sailing down the Illinois and the Mighty Mississippi Rivers from Lake Superior to the Gulf of Mexico.",0.977165937423706,1203,1.6716467142105103

"If you haven’t had the chance to be one of the ‘WAMers’ at National Music Camp, you’re probably wondering what it is that they get up to. Angus McPherson took the time to tell us about his experience of putting down his flute, and picking up a pen, a notebook, and a microphone.
Writing has interested me for a long time, but my studies as a flute player always tended to take precedence. It was only when I saw that the AYO offered a ‘Words About Music’ (WAM) program at the AYO National Music Camp (NMC) that it occurred to me I could combine my passions and add another facet to my career.
The WAM program ran parallel to the orchestral programs at Camp, but our rhythm was very different – deadlines cascaded over the two weeks, and by the final days, when the orchestras were rehearsing madly for the last concerts, our programs had gone to print and we were debriefing. Day-to-day we researched, wrote and workshopped program notes for the concerts, planned articles for the camp magazine and blog, and worked with our mentors on radio techniques and production. We spent hours in our office, writing quietly or poring over scores. We inhaled coffee and wrote frantically into the night to meet early deadlines. In workshops we discussed grammar and how to encapsulate a symphony in 500 words.
Through the WAM program, I was fortunate to be selected for the Willoughby Symphony Orchestra Fellowship. The brief sounded simple: write program notes for each of the orchestra’s subscription concerts. The process ended up being much more involved. In addition to researching and writing notes, I was proofreading programs (and trying to memorise the esoteric symbols proof-readers use to mark-up documents), editing artist biographies, liaising with designers, conductors and musicians, and interviewing composers about new works. My mentors from the industry were dauntingly knowledgeable, warmly encouraging and very thorough. There were moments of suspense: a marimba part, which I had specifically mentioned in the program notes, was cut from the orchestration moments before the print deadline!
Overall, the fellowship was incredibly rewarding, and I have a far greater appreciation for the effort that goes into creating programs. Now, whenever I attend a concert my eyes skip down to the byline to see who wrote the program notes and I find myself scouring the program book for misplaced apostrophes! A particular highlight of the fellowship was interviewing Elena Kats-Chernin about her work Re-Collecting ASTORoids.
The other significant opportunity that came out of the WAM program was an introduction to WAM alumna Stephanie Eslake, who founded the classical music website CutCommon. In the year following NMC I’ve been writing articles, conducting interviews and reviewing concerts for CutCommon and I’ve recently started receiving commissions to write for other publications as well.
I’m in the process of completing a PhD in Music, majoring in performance. The skills I’ve gained through the WAM program and the opportunities that followed have been a valuable compliment to my studies. I will always enjoy performing, but I think it is important – and immensely satisfying – to engage more broadly with music. Through writing I have been able to explore repertoire in a completely different way, and I believe the diverse facets of my career enrich and enhance each other.
My advice for anyone interested in pursuing a career in music writing is this: read as much as possible! Read everything from program notes, articles and concert reviews to novels, biographies and anything else you can get your hands on.",0.9716066122055054,769,1.4172760248184204

"Deciding between a floating wood floor and glued-down wood flooring can be difficult.
How can you determine which installation aligns more with your preferences?
Some contents in this article may contain external links. For more information, please refer to our
What is a Floating Wood Floor?
The floating wood floor isn’t affixed to the existing floor with nails or glue. It rests above it as a flooring option.
Using a click-and-lock mechanism, we fasten the wooden floor planks, enabling their grooves to interlock seamlessly without the need for additional fasteners.
Floating Wood Flooring Advantages
Easy to Install
Using a click-and-lock system, you slide the floating floor planks together and hear a click, locking them in place.
This method makes the process easier and saves you money by eliminating the need to buy nails and wood glue.
You no longer have to strain your fingers, use a hammer, or deal with adhesives when installing wood flooring. This method makes the process easier and saves you money by eliminating the need to buy nails and wood glue.
No Toxic Chemicals
Wood adhesives and glues include formaldehyde and phthalates in their composition.
Phthalates refer to a category of chemicals commonly utilized in the production of plastics. The CDC indicates that certain varieties of phthalates may pose significant risks to our reproductive health.
Wood Flooring provides comfortability
The gap between your subfloor and the hardwood planks acts as a cushioning layer for your flooring. Consequently, floating wood floors provide more comfort for your feet compared to conventional floor installations.
Floating Wood Floor Disadvantages
Prone to buckling and warping
Frequent high humidity in your region might not make a floating wood floor an ideal option for you.
The wooden floorboards and subfloors naturally absorb and release moisture from their surroundings, causing them to expand and contract. However, in humid regions, moisture accumulates in the air pockets between the subfloor and the floorboards.
Regular Maintenance on Floating Wood Floor
The wood planks bear the entire weight of a floating floor installation, potentially causing indentations over time.
If you’re planning to install floating wood floors in a nursery or home office, be aware that they can increase sound transmission.
What is Glued-Down Wood Flooring?
Securing floor planks with adhesive is a classic method for installing wooden flooring. This technique involves bonding the planks directly to the subfloor using glue. Once the adhesive cures, the planks are solidly anchored to the concrete subfloor.
When working with engineered wood or vinyl, you can choose between two options for adhering the flooring: using hard-set adhesive or applying pressure-sensitive adhesive.
Hard-set glued-down wood flooring requires the application of adhesives directly onto the concrete subfloor, followed by placing the planks on top until the adhesive cures. In contrast, pressure-sensitive glue-down flooring employs a peel-and-stick method. The planks come pre-coated with adhesive on the back; you simply peel off the protective layer and adhere them to the subfloor.
Glued Down Flooring Advantages
The wood planks are adhered to the subfloor, which minimizes movement compared to a floating wood floor. This setup provides a sturdier feel underfoot, eliminating the bothersome sensation of the floor shifting beneath you.
Vapor Barrier Not Needed
With glued-down flooring, the adhesive serves as the vapor barrier, eliminating the necessity for purchasing and installing underlayments.
The floor planks are securely installed, which prevents them from creaking when walked on. This quality makes them ideal for areas where quiet is essential, such as your nursery, bedroom, or home office.
Glued-down Flooring disadvantages
Difficult to install & remove
Installing and removing glued-down flooring usually necessitates the expertise of a professional. While you might attempt to handle it on your own, lacking significant experience in floor installation can lead to complications. Additionally, this method involves the use of potent adhesives, which can pose health risks if not managed properly.
The costs for this expertise and materials can accumulate substantially.
Floating Wood Floor vs. Glued-Down Wood Flooring
Ultimately, it comes down to what you prefer. Every type of floor installation comes with its advantages and disadvantages.

You probably don’t give much thought to your subfloor since it’s hidden beneath your feet. However, it plays a crucial role in supporting specific types of flooring, such as hardwood or carpeting. These types of flooring cannot be directly attached to the joists in your house. Although it can last for around 30 years, there will come a time when it needs to be replaced.
Here are a few indicators that it’s time to consider replacing…
There’s a funky odor
If you notice a musty odor lingering but can’t pinpoint the source, it might be originating from beneath your floor. The musty scent could indicate water damage to the subfloor. When you detect a musty smell, you’re likely detecting mold or mildew that has accumulated.
Your Floors Squeak
Squeaky floors are often caused by the nails that secure the floor to the subfloor shifting back and forth as you walk. While you might be able to fix a single squeaky spot, if the entire area is squeaking, it’s a clear indication that the subfloor has become warped.
The Floors Are Uneven
If you happen to see that your floors are not level, there are a couple of potential reasons, but they usually indicate the need for a replacement. The unevenness might be caused by a warped material or it could be due to certain sections of the subfloor starting to decay. If decay is the issue, it’s crucial to have it fixed or replaced promptly to prevent it from spreading to other areas.
You Can Feel the Floors Move Beneath Your Feet
Your feet should have a solid surface to walk on. Even if you have carpet, you shouldn’t feel any movement beneath you. If it feels bouncy, springy, or spongy, it’s a clear indication that there’s an issue. While bouncing around in a bouncy house may be enjoyable, feeling like you’re in one on your wood floor means it’s time to replace.
Tile Floors Are Broken
Make sure the subfloor under your tiles is sturdy enough to prevent cracking and breaking. Weak subfloors can cause tile damage, so check for issues like rot that may be compromising its strength.
Linoleum Appears to Be Bubbling
If your linoleum floor is bubbling, it might indicate an issue. The bubbling could be due to moisture accumulating in the subfloor. Bubbling doesn’t necessarily mean you have to replace it, but it’s a good idea to look into it more.
Your Wood Floor Is Cupping
When the middle of the wooden boards starts to sink, forming a “cup” shape with the edges raised, it’s called cupping. This issue is often due to moisture seeping up from beneath the floor. While a professional can fix it, it might also signal water damage.
If you see your toilet shifting when you sit or stand, it means the subfloor needs to be replaced. The reason your toilet wobbles is that the subfloor below it is either rotten or too damaged to support it properly.
Leaks from the ceiling don’t always mean there’s an issue. But if water is seeping from upstairs through the floor and reaching the ceiling below, it’s possible that the subfloor upstairs is also being damaged.

"Presentation #105.19 in the session Missions and Instruments - Poster Session.
The LargE Area burst Polarimeter (LEAP) is a proposed instrument optimized for measuring polarization and spectra of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). It is capable of measuring polarization from 50 keV to 1 MeV and spectra from 20 keV to 6 MeV. LEAP is a low-risk, wide field-of-view Compton polarimeter designed to be deployed as an external payload on the International Space Station for a 32-month mission. The instrument consists of seven LEAP Polarimeter Modules (LPMs), each containing a 12x12 array of scintillator-PMT detector elements. Two types of scintillators are used within each array. Some elements are made of plastic scintillator (a low-Z material ideal for scattering) and some are made of Cesium Iodide (a high-Z material ideal for photon absorption). A prototype of the instrument has been built to evaluate the design and to characterize the response to polarized photons. The prototype consists of a limited number of detector elements arranged in a 5x5 array. This prototype has been used to carry out polarization and spectral measurements of radioactive sources for multiple observation scenarios. Polarization measurements were made using two different partially polarized sources placed at various locations within the FoV. All measurements were compared with GEANT4 simulations to validate the simulations and our understanding of the full instrument design. The lab data has also been used to evaluate different algorithms for the polarization analysis. We will provide a description of the prototype and summarize results from the laboratory measurements.",0.9238711595535278,334,2.4426662921905518
"What if CPS or Police Force Their Way Into My Home?
CPS are able to forcibly enter a home with a court order.

Facing a CPS investigation can be a stressful time, but knowing what CPS can and cannot do in Michigan can greatly help individuals keep custody of their children and navigate the situation successfully.
Although there are some local laws that individuals will want to familiarize themselves with, by understanding the investigation process and possible outcomes, parents can better prepare for any situations in which custody of their children is at risk.
This complete guide explains exactly what CPS can and cannot do in Michigan, and how parents can protect their children from entering state custody.
Although many individuals will be worried about what CPS can and cannot do in Michigan, understanding the entire process of a CPS investigation can provide the best chance of getting through the process without any surprises.
There are tons of different things to consider during a CPS case, and in many situations, things can progress extremely quickly so having prior knowledge of the way CPS agencies operate is essential.
CPS or child protective services is a state government agency that is essentially in charge of the well-being of children through investigating possible abuse and neglect and making recommendations to the courts as to how to handle the situation.1
In Michigan, CPS is a division of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHH).2
In the majority of cases, CPS investigations will be opened as the result of a report made by a third party that has reason to believe that a child may be the victim of abuse or neglect.
In some cases, this report might be made by someone else that lives in the household, a neighbor, or even a non-custodial parent.4 However, the majority of reports made to CPS are made by mandatory reporters,5 which are individuals who hold certain positions in which they are legally required to report suspicions of abuse or neglect to CPS.
The most common example of this is teachers, however medical professionals, other school administrators, and even mental health professionals are all considered mandatory reporters.
When the CPS investigation begins, CPS will likely make contact with the parent, often by showing up at the residence unannounced. In most cases, CPS will want to speak with the parent that the report was made about as well as anyone who lives in the household, the person who made the report, and the child themselves.
Should there be no evidence of abuse or neglect has occurred, then CPS will likely close the case and the process will essentially be over. However, should CPS find any evidence that abuse or neglect is taking place they will likely approach the parents with these findings and possibly offer them a plan that the parents can complete in order to close the case.
Should these steps not be taken by the parents, then the CPS caseworker will involve the courts at which point the custody of the child will be in jeopardy.
It’s important to remember that despite the phrase ‘CPS case,’ being used so frequently, only CPS has opened a case against the individual, and the courts will not be involved until later.
A more apt name would be “CPS investigation,” since no formal charges will be made when the case first opens because many cases will involve false reports as means of harassment.
Many people will have questions like, do you have the right to know the charges against you in detail during a CPS case, however there are not any charges filed during the initial phases so CPS has no legal obligation to explain the nature of the report to the individual.
Knowing what CPS can and cannot do in Michigan can make the difference between keeping custody of your children and losing them completely. Luckily, compared to law enforcement agencies, the powers of CPS are somewhat limited.
The most notable powers that CPS will exercise during their investigation are outlined below.
CPS will most often try to surprise individuals who have reports made against them to prevent the individual from trying to cover up any abuse or neglect that has been occurring. Many individuals will only learn about a CPS investigation when a CPS caseworker shows up at their front door and asks to be let inside and starts asking questions about the children in the household.
Many people will be wondering, do you have the right not to answer questions, and the answer is yes. Individuals are not required to answer questions from a CPS worker, and many lawyers will advise that their clients do not answer questions as they risk incriminating themselves.
As soon as an individual is aware that they are under investigation by CPS, they should contact an attorney immediately. An experienced lawyer will be able to guide parents through the process and give them the best chance of keeping their children.
Another common question that people have about CPS investigations is, can CPS interview my children at school without my permission or me present, and the answer is yes.
CPS is able to talk to children without the parents having any notice that the conversation is happening.
This is mainly done to protect the children and prevent situations in which the abuser can coach the child into what kind of answers to provide in order to prevent the child from incriminating the parent.
Although CPS can not decide on a whim to remove a child from a home, if there is evidence of abuse or neglect occurring, CPS will make a recommendation to the courts who will likely sign a court order to have the children removed from the home.
This may be done temporarily at first until the court proceedings are finished, at which point the children may be removed permanently or returned to the parent.
Where the child goes when they are removed from the home is discussed further down.
Finally, should the investigation reveal evidence of abuse or neglect, CPS will likely recommend to the courts that the parent’s parental rights be taken away.
The more severe the abuse or neglect, the more likely that the individual will lose their parental rights and the child will be permanently removed from their custody.
There are a few notable things that CPS is not able to legally do that parents should be aware of.
Not only could CPS lie about their powers in order to trick individuals, but a CPS caseworker breaking the law during the investigation could be grounds for the case to be dismissed.
Many people will want to know, do you have the right not to let CPS into your home unless they have a signed warrant or court order, and the answer is yes.
CPS in Michigan must be invited into the home or have a court order should they want to enter the home by force.
When it comes to can CPS enter my home, individuals will likely be advised by their lawyer to turn CPS away at the door, in order to protect themselves.
However, CPS will eventually get a court order to continue its investigation.
The use of illegal substances is often considered neglect by CPS and CPS caseworkers will likely want a parent to take a drug test if evidence of drug use is revealed during their investigation.
Individuals may wonder, should I submit to drug testing, can CPS drug test me? The answer is no.
CPS can not force someone to take a drug test without their consent. However, similar to the issue of CPS entering your home, they are able to get court orders to require the individual to take the test.
Although knowing this kind of information is extremely important, all individuals under CPS investigation should contact a lawyer as soon as possible.
Many people will find themselves in a situation where they might ask themselves, the CPS worker seems nice, why not just cooperate? However, just like law enforcement, CPS will often try to seem nice and helpful in an effort to learn more information that could incriminate the individual.
Knowing how to get a CPS case dismissed is extremely important as it allows individuals to recognize certain signs that there are grounds for the case to be dismissed or closed, and allows them to avoid a lengthy legal battle.
When it comes to how to get a CPS case dismissed in Michigan, there are two main ways this can happen: CPS closing the case themselves, or a judge dismissing the case.
CPS case statistics show that the majority of CPS cases are closed by the CPS caseworker after finding no evidence of abuse or neglect.7 This is why cooperating with a CPS caseworker can sometimes be a good idea, as it will allow for the investigation to be sped up and closed sooner rather than later.
Once the courts are involved, it is much harder to get a case dismissed.
In general, cases will be dismissed for one of two reasons. Either the judge will determine there is not enough evidence for the case to be continued, or the judge will determine that procedural issues with the investigation make the case illegitimate.
In both cases, this decision will likely be prompted by the parent filing a motion for dismissal with the courts.
Once again, this is where a lawyer makes a huge difference as they can help draft the motion for dismissal. Unfortunately, getting a judge to dismiss a case is extremely difficult as there is likely already significant evidence of abuse or neglect if the case has reached the courts.
CPS is also a highly-professional organization and major procedural issues that can cause a case to be dismissed are rare.
After a CPS investigation, many people will wonder till when may a CPS case remain on record, however only CPS cases that involve criminal charges will appear on an individual’s record.
There will be a record of the investigation with CPS, but when it comes to who has access to CPS Records, they will only be used internally by CPS as a reference should the individual be investigated again.
Part of the concern over CPS records has to do with individuals hearing about child abuse investigations. However, there is actually a teaching background screening, daycare background screening, and other individuals who have access to children.
Individuals who are still concerned should know how to perform a criminal records check on themselves using the search bar at the top of this page.
Does CPS notify the other parent when parents of the child are no longer together? Only sometimes.
CPS will notify parents who have partial custody as there is a good chance the custody of the child will be temporarily transferred to this parent during the investigation.
Those wondering, what is a “Court-Appointed Special Advocate,” is simply the person that the child will stay with should custody be taken away temporarily or permanently if there is no other parent or family member that the child can stay with.
Does CPS have to notify the other parent? No.
The other parent will only be notified if they are possibly going to be taking custody of the child.
Parents who are not involved with their children will usually not be notified.
In a CPS case, the non-offending parent can also play a big role in the investigation. The parent who is not under investigation will likely obtain temporary custody of the child for the duration of the investigation.
Beyond this, the non-offending parent also has several rights they can exercise, assuming they have at least partial custody of the child.
The rights of the non-offending parent include being able to appear at any court hearings pertaining to the case where they are able to ask questions and provide evidence and testimony to the judge in the case. This is a great chance for non-offending parents to advocate for their children.
The parent knowing her rights or knowing his rights, as the non-offending parent can heavily impact the custody of the child.
The CPS non-custodial parent is simply the parent that does not have primary custody. In many cases, the non-custodial parent will automatically be given custody of the child during a CPS investigation.
The non-offending parent evaluation is used when the child is being transferred to a safe home when a CPS investigation reveals abuse or neglect and the decision is made to remove the child from the home.
The grounds for involuntary termination of parental rights are outlined by federal law.10 Most notably, instances of severe abuse, such as sexual or physical abuse, and instances of severe neglect, such as abandonment will be grounds for the termination of parental rights.
When it comes to what CPS can and cannot do in Michigan, their powers are fairly straightforward. Individuals should know that CPS is not able to force individuals to do hardly anything, however, their powers can be greatly increased with court orders based on their recommendations.
Although it can seem overwhelming, those under CPS investigation should do their best to understand their local laws regarding child custody and what is considered abuse or neglect. Knowing what CPS can and cannot do in Michigan can determine if individuals are able to retain or lose custody of their children.
CPS are able to forcibly enter a home with a court order.
Many children will benefit from having an LGAL but they are generally not required.
Individuals are not required to cooperate with CPS.
The individual who is appointed court personnel will be responsible for the cost.
CPS can only force individuals to sign medical releases with a court order.
Individuals should seek attorneys that are experienced in family law.
A foster parent background check is the federally required background check for individuals hoping to become foster parents.
CPS can forcibly enter a home with a court order to do so.
Getting a CPS case dismissed in Texas usually requires a judge to grant a motion for dismissal submitted by the parent.
CPS cases can be dropped or dismissed due to lack of evidence or procedural issues.
CPS is only able to enter your home or make individuals take a drug test with a court order. However they are able to talk to children without the knowledge of the parent.
CPS caseworkers in New York are able to ask questions of the child without the parent’s permission, however, they must get permission or a court order to enter an individual’s home.
When it comes to determining a person’s job for garnishment, government agencies will likely be required to find where someone works as they have access to IRS and SSA databases.
Finding out where an individual is employed for child support can often be achieved by performing a social media background investigation. However there is no official employment database that individuals can search.
CPS background checks go back forever and will uncover sealed and sometimes expunged crimes.

Threadapeutic (threadapeutic.com) is a team of textile artisans that transform fabric waste into beautiful new textiles, giving new life to discarded and unwanted materials. Their signature technique was born from a “mistake”. After accidentally underselling a local fashion designer’s tapestry as a tablecloth, founder Hana Surya had to learn the fabric manipulation technique Faux Chenille to remake it.
This sparked a new passion, where she and her team spent the next eight years mastering and pushing the limits of this technique, giving rise to the rich textures and colour-play characteristic of Threadapeutic’s textiles today. The transformed Threadapeutic textiles are used as vibrant decorative tapestry, to create fashion accessories, furniture upholstery and more — all from waste offcuts donated from small to large garment manufactures in Indonesia. Their work has been shown in Paris, Tokyo, and Jakarta. 100% of profits go to good living wages for their artisans and training other local artisans to make upcycled products of exceptional quality.
This exhibition, GIFTS, showcases the beautiful product and its process, displayed as Hana’s journey from ‘housewife’ to textile art studio founder; Threadapeutic gave her a new lease on life.

"Enhance Your Property with Energy Efficient Masonry
Energy efficiency is a hot topic in today’s world, with more and more people looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint and save money on their energy bills. One way to achieve this is by using energy-efficient materials in the construction of your property, such as masonry.
Masonry is a popular choice for many homeowners due to its durability, versatility, and aesthetic appeal. But did you know that masonry can also be an energy-efficient option for your property? By using the right techniques and materials, you can enhance your property with energy-efficient masonry that will help you save on heating and cooling costs while also reducing your impact on the environment.
One of the key benefits of using masonry for your property is its thermal mass properties. Masonry materials such as bricks or concrete have high thermal mass, which means they can absorb heat during the day and release it slowly at night. This helps regulate indoor temperatures, keeping your home cooler in summer and warmer in winter without relying heavily on artificial heating or cooling systems.
In addition to its thermal mass properties, masonry also provides excellent insulation against heat transfer. By choosing insulated concrete blocks or adding insulation between brick walls, you can further improve the energy efficiency of your property. This will not only help reduce your energy bills but also create a more comfortable living environment for you and your family.
Another way to Enhance Your Property with Energy Efficient Masonry is by incorporating passive solar design principles into your building plans. By strategically placing windows, doors, and other openings to maximize natural light and ventilation, you can reduce the need for artificial lighting and air conditioning. This not only saves money but also reduces reliance on fossil fuels and lowers greenhouse gas emissions.
When it comes to choosing materials for your masonry project, opt for those that are locally sourced or made from recycled content whenever possible. This not only supports sustainable practices but also reduces transportation costs and emissions associated with long-distance shipping.
In conclusion, enhancing your property with energy-efficient masonry is a smart investment that pays off both financially and environmentally. By utilizing the thermal mass properties of masonry materials, improving insulation techniques, incorporating passive solar design principles, and choosing sustainable materials, you can create a more efficient home that benefits both you and future generations.

"Eight in 10 food business owners admit they feel unprepared for the Natasha’s Law allergen legislation coming into effect next month, according to new research.
The study, commissioned by global standards organisation GS1, also found four in 10 people across the food industry have never even heard of Natasha’s Law.
The new law, which comes into force on 1 October, will require an individual label showing the name of the food item and a full ingredients list on all pre-packed for direct sale (PPDS) food from October. PPDS is food prepared on the premises where it is being sold, before the consumer purchases it, and either fully or partially enclosed in packaging.
The legislation, officially called the UK Food Information Amendment 2019, was passed in September 2019 after teenager Natasha Ednan-Laperouse suffered a fatal allergic reaction to sesame seeds, an ingredient in a baguette bought pre-packed at Pret A Manger, in 2016.
In spite of an information campaign by the Food Standards Agency to help businesses comply with the new regulations, the GS1 study found just over half of small and medium sized businesses have taken steps to be in a good position ahead of the new law. Only 39% are providing training on types of allergens and more than one in five say they are awaiting further training and guidance.
Only 48% of employees in small independent businesses have heard of Natasha’s Law, although 79% of employees from chains and franchises were aware of the legislation.
Six in 10 business owners are now worried about allergic reactions happening at their property yet four in 10 said they wouldn’t feel completely confident that they could answer a customer’s questions about allergens with their food items.
Half of the business owners said they would need to get more allergen information from suppliers and find a better way to collate it, while 79% of chain and franchise owners said they would change suppliers if their current ones couldn’t provide the correct information.
Chris Tyas, chair of GS1 UK and former acting director of Food Supply and chair Food Resilience Industry Forum, believes the research highlights the need for the whole food supply chain to have access to the full range of allergen data.
“One of the biggest concerns surrounding Natasha’s law is whether businesses will be able to quickly and accurately get up to date allergen information – especially smaller businesses whose ingredients may change daily,” Tyas said. “Yet the research shows that these small businesses are the least prepared.
“To comply successfully we believe the continued digitalisation of the supply chain is much needed. A recommendation that is also at the heart of the recently released National Food Strategy.”
Henry Dimbleby, co-founder of Leon and author of the National Food Strategy, said Natasha’s Law “represents a hugely positive, yet complex transformation for the food sector – one fraught with risk”. Commenting on the research, he added that it was “worrying” that awareness of the law is inconsistent “but not particularly surprising after everything the sector has had thrown at it over the last 18 months”.",0.9652490615844727,657,2.064115285873413
"A staple houseplant of every home, lucky bamboo (Dracaena sanderiana) is a plant that you would be excited to share with friends or family due to its beautiful appearance and symbolic significance.
If you have a lucky bamboo plant that is getting out of hand, you may be wondering if you can propagate it, and the answer is yes! Despite its unique appearance, lucky bamboo is almost as easy to propagate as a pothos plant. There are several ways you can go about it; from taking stem cuttings to propagating new offshoots, you can get successful propagations either in water or soil. If you take proper measures to prevent rotting, lucky bamboo propagations are often quite successful.
In this article, we’ll take a look at the various methods for propagating lucky bamboo and go through the steps you can take to avoid rot. Before you know it, you’ll end up with plenty of new lucky bamboo plants to share!
About lucky bamboo
You may not know this, but lucky bamboo is not, in fact, a true bamboo! It’s a member of the Dracaena genus, which includes another popular houseplant, Dracaena marginata. Lucky bamboo’s botanical name is Dracaena sanderiana, and it’s a member of the Asparagaceae family.
That’s right, lucky bamboo is a closer relative to asparagus than to true bamboo (family Poaceae). So why the nickname? These popular houseplants have nodes along the stem that make them closely resemble bamboo culms. Moreover, the leaves of lucky bamboo are long and angular, similar to the leaves of real bamboo.
While lucky bamboo may not be a true bamboo, having a lucky bamboo houseplant (or many) is a great way to bring some of the bamboo aesthetic indoors. Lucky bamboo isn’t only beautiful, but its stems are hardy and they’re notoriously hard to kill. Plus, lucky bamboo can symbolize good luck, fortune, abundance, and positivity.
Why propagate lucky bamboo?
There are a few reasons why you may want to propagate your lucky bamboo plant. The first is to simply make more plants. Lucky bamboo plants make fantastic gifts and are known to bring good luck (hence the name) and abundance into the home. You don’t need to purchase more when your own plant grows new offshoots readily.
You can also propagate the offshoots to give your lucky bamboo plant a fuller appearance, as pruning the plant encourages it to grow new shoots and leaves. When you prune a plant, the plant growth hormones known as auxins spread to other areas of the plant, ultimately encouraging more lateral growth. This means that once you prune your lucky bamboo, you will likely see more offshoots develop.
The last reason why you may need to propagate your lucky bamboo has to do with rescuing it. If your lucky bamboo is suffering from a pest infestation, root rot, or infection, you may have to prune the diseased parts of the plant in order to prevent spread and encourage new growth.
Is propagating lucky bamboo easy?
Propagating lucky bamboo may seem intimidating due to its appearance, but it’s straightforward to propagate. As long as you follow the steps in this article, lucky bamboo cuttings have a high success rate.
The biggest problem with propagating lucky bamboo
That said, the most common issue with propagating lucky bamboo is root rot or stem rot. Below we’ll go over why cuttings rot, and when you may want to use a rooting hormone or alternative to help your cutting propagate.
Why do cuttings rot?
The biggest concern when propagating lucky bamboo is root or stem rot. Essentially, rot happens when water breaks down the protective outer layer of a plant to form lesions. These lesions leave your lucky bamboo vulnerable to microscopic bacteria, fungus, or disease that will cause the plant to rot.
Propagations tend to be more susceptible to rotting than established plants since the act of taking a cutting results in an open wound. If the rot reaches the node where roots typically grow, then that node may no longer be able to produce roots.
Protecting your cutting from root and stem rot begins at the initial pruning process and carries through the entire propagation process, which we’ll go over in more detail below.
Do you need rooting hormone for lucky bamboo propagation?
Rooting hormone is a synthetic growth hormone designed to replicate the effects of the auxins found naturally in plants. You can purchase powdered rooting hormone from most garden supply stores or online.
Alternatively, you can try natural rooting hormone alternatives, such as cinnamon, honey, or aloe vera, which have vitamins and antibacterial properties to help stimulate root growth.
Whether you use rooting hormones to help propagate your lucky bamboo cutting comes down to personal preference, but in most cases, it’s not necessary. Lucky bamboo cuttings typically root well when propagated correctly, although some gardeners swear by the effectiveness of rooting hormone and will not propagate a cutting without it.
How to take a lucky bamboo cutting
When taking a lucky bamboo cutting for propagation, the more healthy stems you have available, the higher your chance of success. Ideally, you’ll want to take a cutting from an offshoot, cutting as close as you can to the mother plant without injuring it.
Use a sharp, sterile knife or pruning shears to cut the offshoot with minimal damage to the mother plant. Remove the lower leaves from your lucky bamboo offshoot. However, you must keep some leaves at the top of the cutting for photosynthesis.
If you’re taking a cutting to save a diseased plant, you may have to take a stem cutting rather than an offshoot cutting. In this case, cut a piece of healthy stem with at least one node. Nodes are quite easy to find on lucky bamboo, simply look for a bump or “knuckle” in the stem.
Once you have taken the cutting, whether offshoot or stem, allow the wound to callus over by leaving it alone for about 12 hours. Allowing the wound to develop a protective layer will reduce the chances of fungus or disease infecting the stem. Alternatively, if you’ve taken a stem cutting, you can use melted wax to seal the wound and reduce the chance of rotting.
Once you’ve taken a cutting, you can either propagate it in water or soil:
How to propagate lucky bamboo in water
To propagate your lucky bamboo cutting in water, simply place it in a small glass or vase with approximately 1-2 inches of distilled water. Make sure that the node is submerged, but you want to avoid completely submerging the stem, as this can increase the chances of developing rot. You may have to lean your cutting on the sides of the container to hold it up.
Monitor your lucky bamboo cutting for root growth and signs of rot. If you notice that the stem is turning discolored or black, you may want to consider cutting the rotted portions back and trying again. Change out the water once weekly to avoid algae growth in the pot, which can encourage rot.
Lucky bamboo cuttings tend to produce new roots within 1-2 weeks, but sometimes it can take up to a month. Pot your lucky bamboo once the secondary roots form from the original primary roots to give your cutting the highest chance of success.
Can I keep growing my lucky bamboo in water?
You may have seen people growing lucky bamboo in water with stones or gravel, and wondered whether you can do the same with your new lucky bamboo cuttings. Once those cuttings are rooted, you can indeed “plant” them in water as they are notoriously hardy plants that don’t need too many nutrients to thrive.
Some people use rocks or gravel to help stabilize their lucky bamboo when potted in water. However, if you hope to encourage root growth in a lucky bamboo cutting, avoid adding rocks or gravel until a healthy root system is established. Adding rocks prematurely can suffocate new roots and may result in root rot.
How to propagate lucky bamboo in soil
While it’s easy to propagate lucky bamboo in water, you can even plant your fresh cuttings in soil. To propagate your lucky bamboo cuttings in soil, start by finding a small pot or a container with sufficient drainage. Add a well-draining soil mix, such as cactus mix, or make your own soil mix with elements such as compost, peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite.
Next, place your cutting in the soil, just covering the node. Be careful not to submerge the entire stem as this can lead to stem rot. If your lucky bamboo has a hard time standing up, you can help it with a small stake (popsicle sticks with twine work nicely) until it starts to develop those sturdy roots.
Place your lucky bamboo cutting in a location that receives bright, indirect light and keep the soil moist but never soggy. You may be tempted to tug on the bamboo to see if healthy roots have developed, but it’s best to avoid disturbing the roots in their early stages.
FAQ about lucky bamboo propagation
Will my lucky bamboo cutting grow curly?
You may have purchased your lucky bamboo with curly stems or have noticed other people with these unusual spiraling lucky bamboo plants. Unfortunately, lucky bamboo does not grow this way naturally. This is done through a process called phototropism, where a young lucky bamboo is trained to follow a light that rotates every few days.
You can experiment with shaping your lucky bamboo at home, but if you simply place your cutting on a windowsill, your lucky bamboo will grow vertically, which is still quite beautiful!
How does a dying lucky bamboo cutting look like?
It is possible that your lucky bamboo cutting doesn’t look very happy. If the cutting turns yellow and even gets black roots, it’s a sign that it got root rot. And this, unfortunately, causes your plant to die. Especially fresh cuttings are more vulnerable. So it’s very important to use sterile tools for propagating your lucky bamboo.
If your cutting starts developing a yellow or brown leaf, immediately check the water and roots. You still might be able to turn it around.
Is it better to grow lucky bamboo in water or soil?
This house plant can tolerate both, soil and water. However, it will survive longer in soil as it’s the natural ground. Each methods has it’s pros and cons. You can always switch from water to soil if you want to give both a try.",0.9401048421859741,2228,2.4905381202697754
"The meeting between Deco, the newly appointed sporting director of FC Barcelona, and Moussa Sissoko Ousmane Dembélé’s agent, is just around the corner, with a contract renewal on sight. Although the exact date is yet to be confirmed. But both parties are aware that it will take place in the coming days. It can take place either this week or at the latest, early next week. While it remains uncertain if Mateu Alemany will be present, Deco will be there alongside Sissoko.
According to MD, Dembélé and his representative aim to maintain the positive dialogue and communication with the club. It wasn’t always like that. But it was established during last year’s contract renewal process. This continued into the first meeting held this year, which focused on extending the winger’s contract set to expire on June 30, 2024. FC Barcelona is keen to secure Dembélé’s services until 2027. Moreover, on his part, the player himself is receptive to the idea.
There is a good rapport between Sissoko and the club. Therefore, the plan is to discuss Dembélé’s renewal based on the initial proposal that Barcelona presented to the French winger. Dembélé’s intentions are clear: to reach an agreement for renewal. He is very content at Barcelona under the guidance of Xavi Hernández. However, he also seeks a salary improvement commensurate with his status as a key player in the coach’s plans.
Appealing Release Clause
On the club’s side, there is a sense of urgency to swiftly conclude Dembélé’s renewal. They fear the vulnerable position they find themselves in. Firstly, his release clause has been reduced from €100 million to €50 million during the months of June and July. Moreover, out of the €50 million, if someone were to trigger the clause and sign Dembélé, Barcelona would only receive €25 million, with the remaining €25 million going to the player’s agent. As part of the renewal, the club also intends to increase his release clause.
However, Deco, Alemany, and Laporta are determined to avoid a repeat of last year’s drawn-out renewal process, which caught everyone by surprise, including Xavi, who believed Dembélé was destined to leave. The agreement reached was only for two years, leaving Dembélé free to negotiate with other clubs in just over a year’s time, by June 30, 2024.
With the pivotal summit on the horizon, all parties involved are eager to secure Dembélé’s long-term commitment to FC Barcelona, ensuring that the negotiations proceed smoothly and efficiently, leaving no room for the uncertainties of the past.",0.9711026549339294,590,0.7390638589859009
"By Stephanie Taylor in Ottawa
The commissioner of Correctional Service Canada said Thursday that serial killer Paul Bernardo will remain in the Quebec medium-security prison he was transferred to earlier this year.
Anne Kelly said a review of the controversial decision to move him out of the maximum-security Millhaven Institution west of Kingston, Ont., concluded it was ""sound and followed all applicable laws and policies.""
""The news that this inmate had been transferred from a maximum to a medium-security institution upset many Canadians and I know that many are looking for answers,"" Kelly said in Ottawa.
She said she made the ""exceptional"" move to authorize the release of personal information.
""I believe it is in the public interest to have a better understanding of the reasons why this specific decision was made.""
Bernardo is serving an indeterminate life sentence for the kidnapping, assault and murders of 15-year-old Kristen French and 14-year-old Leslie Mahaffy in the early 1990s near St. Catharines, Ont.
The 85-page review released Thursday shows Bernardo's security classification was reviewed 14 times between 1999 and 2022, and each time he met the criteria to be moved to a medium-security institution.
It says these results had previously been ""overridden"" because his high-profile status placed him at a greater safety risk, and most of his interactions with other offenders in maximum-security prison were extremely restricted and controlled.
The review says Bernardo applied to be moved to the medium-security Bath Institution in June 2022, but a security review that found he met the bar for transfer was ""overridden"" because of his failure to integrate with other inmates.
Bernardo then worked with senior officials at Millhaven to develop an integration plan, the review says, and was ""fully integrated"" within that prison by July 2022.
He then successfully applied to be moved to the La Macaza Institution in Quebec. That facility offers treatment for sex offenders.
From last July until the transfer in May, ""there were no documented incidents or behavioural concerns"" reported by staff, the review says.
""Staff at Millhaven Institution reiterated that the ongoing impediment to the offender’s reclassification to medium was his failure to integrate; thus, upon, integration, there were no longer grounds to warrant a maximum security classification.""
The review found that the correctional service followed applicable laws and policies when it came to victim notification, Kelly said.
But it noted that notifying victims' families the day of Bernardo's transfer created ""surprise and shock.""
The review committee said it ""recognized that news of the transfer, including the nature of notification, caused emotional distress for victims.”
Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino, who has faced calls from the Conservatives to resign over his handling of the issue, had said Correctional Service Canada owed Canadians an explanation given the severity of Bernardo's crimes.
Mendicino had also said he would issue a directive instructing the federal correctional service to ensure the public safety minister is formally and directly notified in advance of the transfer of high-profile or dangerous offenders.
Mendicino has said that he was not been briefed about the transfer until the day after it happened, despite his staff being notified in the months before.
Kelly noted the atmosphere created by Bernardo's transfer, but reiterated that the Canadian correctional system is fundamentally based on the rehabilitation of offenders.
""Hearing about this case so intensely over the past several weeks has brought up strong emotions and rightly so,"" she said at a news conference.
""Crimes that continue to have an immeasurable impact on the victims and their families. We want justice to be served. … We want Canadians to have confidence in our decisions.""
Speaking to reporters at an unrelated event in Kingston, Ont., on Thursday morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sidestepped direct questions about whether he remains confident in Mendicino, saying only that an MP's presence in cabinet signals that he has confidence in them.
Trudeau said the concerns of the families of Bernardo's victims are top of mind for his government, adding the upcoming report from the correctional service would highlight the ""thinking and processes"" behind his controversial transfer.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 20, 2023.

"In the relentless pursuit of turning back the hands of time, the beauty industry has witnessed a revolution in the form of Botox, a transformative cosmetic procedure that has become synonymous with defying the aging process. Botox, derived from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, has emerged as a powerful tool in the arsenal against wrinkles and fine lines, offering a non-invasive solution to combat the visible signs of aging. Celebrating its discovery’s medical roots, where it was initially utilized to treat conditions like muscle spasms and migraines, Botox has evolved into a cosmetic powerhouse, captivating the attention of individuals seeking a rejuvenated and youthful appearance. The magic of Botox lies in its ability to temporarily paralyze muscles, preventing them from contracting and causing wrinkles. When strategically injected into specific facial muscles, it smoothens out lines and creases, creating a more youthful and refreshed look.
The procedure is quick, relatively painless, and requires minimal downtime, making it a popular choice for those with busy lifestyles. Its non-permanent nature allows individuals to experiment with their appearance without committing to long-term changes, adding to its allure. Botox has transcended its initial cosmetic applications, extending its influence beyond just erasing wrinkles. The treatment has found success in addressing a myriad of aesthetic concerns, including reshaping the jawline, lifting the eyebrows, and even reducing excessive sweating. This versatility has propelled Botox into the forefront of aesthetic medicine, where its transformative power is harnessed for various purposes beyond mere wrinkle reduction. The psychological impact of Botox cannot be overlooked. As individuals witness their wrinkles fade away, there is a notable boost in self-confidence and a revitalized sense of self-esteem. The correlation between physical appearance and mental well-being has been a subject of extensive research, and Botox has emerged as a tangible link between the two.
The ripple effect of a smoother, more youthful appearance extends beyond the physical realm, influencing emotional and social aspects of an individual’s life. However, the transformative power of Botox does not come without its share of controversies in cedar hills therapeutics. Critics argue that the pursuit of eternal youth through cosmetic interventions can perpetuate unrealistic beauty standards and contribute to societal pressures. Ethical considerations surrounding informed consent and the potential for overuse of Botox raise essential questions about the boundaries between personal choice and societal expectations. In conclusion, the transformative power of Botox is undeniable, reshaping not only faces but also perceptions of beauty and aging. As this cosmetic marvel continues to evolve, striking a balance between aesthetic enhancement and responsible use remains crucial. Ultimately, the quest for ageless beauty is a personal journey, and Botox stands as a testament to the ever-expanding possibilities in the realm of cosmetic innovation.",0.9371690154075623,566,2.0528745651245117

"It’s common knowledge that laptops age over time, and eventually the time comes to throw in the towel and fork out the cash for a new one.
But sometimes, when a laptop is having issues, the solution is actually in the battery.
The first (and most obvious) sign that the battery is dying, is that it runs out of power at a faster rate. Batteries have a certain amount of times they can be charged and discharged, this is called a charging cycle. Once the battery hits a certain number of these cycles (400 is the average), the performance quality drops and it fails to hold its charge. If you regularly use your laptop plugged in, your battery may be past its use-by date.
Random shutdowns are also a key sign that there is something wrong with the battery. This can also be a sign that the hard drive is beginning to fail as well.
Lastly, overheating. If your laptop is overheating constantly, especially underneath, it may a be another sign that the battery is on its last legs.
While batteries can’t necessarily be ‘fixed’, there are ways to restore them and extend their life and delay having to purchase a new one.
The first method is to monitor your power use. Most laptops have built apps that allow you to monitor power usage, and view which apps are draining it the most. Try closing the apps that are using the most energy (Google Chrome and Facebook normally do this), and switching off Bluetooth, this will relieve pressure on the battery.
Secondly, removing the battery when it isn’t needed. If you are frequently using your PC laptop while plugged in, you may want to take the battery out, and leave the laptop plugged into the wall. This will save the battery cycles for when you use the computer remotely. Unfortunately, you can't do this with MacBooks.
Nowadays laptop batteries are within a reasonable price range for anybody to afford. They can be as cheap as $20.00 and can climb well into the hundreds, depending on what type of laptop you own.
It is important to remember when buying a battery that you will get what you pay for. A cheaper battery may end up doing more harm to your laptop, especially if it's an older model.
As for MacBooks, we recommend getting Apple or an authorised Apple reseller to have a look
Don’t just toss your battery away, as they contain harmful chemicals and if they end up in a landfill, they can cause extensive environmental damage.
There are battery recycling plants located all over Melbourne, you can find your nearest one here.",0.9615033864974976,539,2.6000938415527344
"Table of Contents
What is the Certificate of Incumbency?
A Certificate of Incumbency is an official document used to confirm the identities of key individuals within a company, such as executives, directors, or shareholders.
It is also known by various other names, including officer’s certificate, register of directors, certificate of officers, or secretary’s certificate. This document is primarily utilized by Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) or corporations.
It’s important to note that when a new Certificate of Incumbency is created, the previous one becomes invalid.
When do you need to use the Certificate of Incumbency?
A Delaware Certificate of Incumbency serves to identify who has the power to legally decide on behalf of a business or LLC in 4 circumstances.
For business deal-making or signing any official documents
An agreement becomes invalid (null and void) when an unauthorized signing officer signs a contract with another party. That’s when a certificate of incumbency comes in handy to prove the authority of the signatory. This is especially important when you expand business across borders, or outside of Delaware.
Organizations wishing to work with your LLC need to know who in your organization is authorized to sign contracts with them before entering into partnerships.
A third party can rest assured about the legality and trustworthiness of this document because it contains the company seal and is preserved by the corporate secretary.
Opening bank accounts
Opening bank accounts for Delaware companies is a significant activity that needs this certificate. The bank or any other financial institution will inquire about your authorized agents if you wish to open a checking or business banking account.
Certificates of incumbency are a requirement to create new accounts, apart from other legal documents that establish your business under state laws. This is easier for the banks to verify that the person opening the business account is authorized.
For example, let’s say you are the President of a business who comes to the bank for a transaction. You can show the bank this certificate with your name and (president) title cited on the document. This way, the bank knows that you are a legal representative.
Confirming the minute book is valid
The Minute Book records all the vital documents, such as annual reports, bylaws, shareholders’ or directors’ resolutions, and meetings. When there is a need to validate the signing officers in the Minute Book, the certificate of incumbency will come in handy (usually when the government agencies or auditors need to confirm the validity).
What information should be included in a Certificate Of Incumbency?
The first thing is a lead-in text of the secretary that introduces his/her name, on behalf of what company, and claims that the following signatures are true. You can refer to the Certificate of Incumbency LLC sample for a more details.
Following the introduction, the document lists all individuals within the company who have the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the business. This list includes their names and titles, along with spaces for their signatures. The document should include the names, titles, and blank spaces for signatures of the president, CEO, shareholders, officers, treasurer, and registered agents. Additionally, the secretary’s signature is also required.
Each signature provided by these authorized officials serves as a reference point. This is crucial in case unauthorized parties attempt to forge signatures, as it helps prevent any illicit or questionable business transactions conducted on behalf of the company.
Finally, at the conclusion of the certificate, you will find the company seal, as previously mentioned.
How to get a Certificate Of Incumbency?
To get a Certificate of Incumbency LLC, you can simplify this process with two main steps:
Prepare all the information to make a draft: You should draft a complete list of authorized people to speed up the process. Usually, the company secretary will handle this work.
Create and file the company’s minute book: This one should be filed because it confirms who has the authority to sign or enter an agreement.
Who signs a Certificate of Incumbency?
All parties with signing authority, usually a Secretary or a designated company officer, must sign and print their names. And the last step is sealing the contract when the company’s secretary signs at the bottom.
Delaware Certificate of Incumbency is related to business contracts, legal matters, and settling disputes in the future. That’s why you need to put more effort into getting it done when starting a company.
The advice for you is to seek an experienced consultant’s help to ensure the procedure’s completion. Or feel free to contact us at email@example.com for assistance.
Frequently Asked Questions
Does Delaware issue Certificate Of Incumbency?
Yes, Delaware can issue a Certificate of Incumbency, though you can do it on your own. Many Delaware companies prefer a third party to issue this certificate.
Is a Certificate Of Incumbency necessary?
Yes, it is. Especially if you want to open a business bank account as it will be easier for the banks to verify your identity and authority.
For entering partnerships or opening accounts, this is also necessary. Both you and the opposite party must confirm the identity (of the signer). This shows your partners that the person they are working with is an authorized representative.

"Sophie looked out the window as her parents drove her up the long driveway to the treatment center. She wasn’t so sure she need to be in rehabilitation for teens, but her parents were certain it was necessary. She couldn’t get a handle on her depression and anxiety and her doctors could only advise inpatient treatment.
Sophie, 14, was afraid of being away from her family, especially her little sister, Emily, who was only 8. Would the other kids make fun of her? Would she be able to stay alone for 3 months? Who was going to help her with her homework? These were just a few of the questions Sophie had as the car came to a stop at the front door.
So, what does happen on a daily basis in rehabilitation for teens? A typical day starts with breakfast and self-care, followed by group therapy, individual therapy, academics, chores, and recreation.
It is not unusual for teens to let themselves go when they are in a bad mental state. Teens entering a rehab facility may have completely ignored self-care because they are dealing with other, more pressing issues. Rehabilitation for teens requires that teens learn about the importance of self-care. It is hard to fix what’s going on in the mind if the body is in bad shape.
The idea of self-care can be overwhelming at first. People today consider self-care as maybe taking a long bath or treating oneself to a shopping spree; but, self-care is so much more. Self-care is unique to each person. For some people, self-care will be doing the dishes after being depressed for days on end; for others, it will be going to a movie after a bad week. However you practice healthy self-care is okay.
Teens can wrongly deduce that self-care is a selfish act, but there’s a difference between being selfish and practicing self-care. Self-care is about learning to love and care for yourself. It can be challenging, but showing yourself patience, compassion, and love is the foundation of getting and staying healthy.
Self-care is also about eating right. Teen rehabs include learning about proper eating habits and what’s good for the body. If a teen has an eating disorder, this is also a critical part of their treatment plan. Many teens overuse caffeine and other legal substances to help them cope, but they don’t realize how that can damage multiple body systems and interfere with sleep.
Sophie never once thought about self-care as a way to cope with her depression and anxiety. Putting that focus on positive ways to care for herself helped her start the process of coping with her feelings. She was also used to skipping breakfast – and she never once thought it could be detrimental to her overall health or even contribute to her depression.
Once teens have practiced self-care and had a nutritious breakfast, they move on to the next order of the day: group therapy.
Group therapy can be intimidating and scary. Most rehabilitation for teens includes group therapy as a critical key in the overall process. Sophie was scared of group therapy. She felt like she was going to be judged and ridiculed by the other teens, especially those who didn’t understand depression.
Teens newer to the process can benefit by seeing others who work to overcome their issues and move forward with an enjoyable life. There is power and influence in group therapy, along with support, strength, and confidence to be gained from one another.
Experts support the positive impact of groups in adolescent residential rehabilitation. While individual therapy will always be central to the teen’s recovery program, work done in group sessions, with an audience of one’s peers, recognizes the importance of peers at this stage of a teen’s life.
Teens tend to be more open and truthful in peer groups and can identify with feelings and issues expressed by their peers that they themselves may not have addressed yet. Identifying with other teens gives them a sense of belonging and hope that if their peers can develop, mature, and heal, so can they.
Professionally led peer group meetings are safe and structured, allowing students to gain insight and possibly learn and perfect new coping mechanisms for life. Sophie wasn’t sure at first about going to group, but in time she saw the value of knowing she was not alone and that others struggled just as she did.
Group also provides accountability among students; as a group, they make a commitment to working together on their issues. The more Sophie went to group, the more confident she was to help others, which promoted her self-esteem and gave her a sense of personal growth.
After group, students would then attend individual therapy – a place Sophie wanted nothing to do with.
In individual therapy, it is common to address issues even the patient has no desire to address. It is very painful to admit problems, relive traumas, or talk about embarrassing subjects. Sophie felt so ashamed by her self-perceived weakness. She didn’t want to go into therapy and admit that she was not strong enough to deal with her problems on her own. She wanted to be like her parents – tough cookies who never let anything get in the way.
But as part of a teen rehab program, individual therapy is a must. However, individual therapy has both advantages and disadvantages.
In individual therapy, the teens are guaranteed privacy and confidentiality. This is crucial for the teen to build a sense of trust in others and a comfortability with sharing their issues. The one-on-one attention from the therapist gives the therapist the opportunity to fully understand the specific problems of each teen and help them develop an individualized approach to treatment.
When working with a therapist one on one, the therapist can better analyze and treat the teen. This allows for the teen to work at his or her own pace, speeding up or slowing down as needed for proper adjustment. Individual therapy allows for the client to get a self-awareness of his or her needs without the distraction of a group setting. The therapist and teen can create a deep sense of trust and a positive working relationship.
However, individual therapy can have its drawbacks. Some teens may need to relate with other teens who share similar issues. This comradery in group therapy can be much more powerful than what a teen can find in individual therapy. Individual therapy also calls for a certain level of self-motivation that many teens lack. The teen may not be committed to doing the work, making positive changes, or applying new techniques to dealing with his or her issues.
As she worked with her therapist, Sophie found that the individual attention really forced her to focus on her issues and not get distracted by the group therapy dynamics. Sophie came to terms with her past traumas and learned how they affected her depression and anxiety. And all of this therapy was time consuming, leaving Sophie feeling a bit anxious about her schoolwork.
Sophie was really worried about how she was going to keep up with schoolwork in with residential rehabilitation treatment. She had always been a good student and didn’t want this 90-day program to put her behind. Sophie was relieved to find out that her treatment center had a great academics program.
It’s not uncommon for teen rehab centers to offer academic programs so teens don’t fall behind in school. Some centers use tutors or even licensed teachers to help keep the teens on track. Academic programs offered by teen rehab facilities can be designed as self-study or distance-learning through an online learning platform.
During their stay at teen rehab centers, teens work on school assignments while attending individual therapy and group therapy. Tutors or teachers evaluate where teens stand academically. They teens are provided with academic support to help them reach their academic goals. At many teen rehab centers, residents are expected to finish their schoolwork, including all homework assignments.
Sophie found the tutors and teachers at her facility to be extremely helpful. They were kind-hearted, patient, and understood the frustration that comes with anxiety. They helped Sophie with her AP course work, catching up on where she was behind, tutoring when she didn’t understand something, and even getting her mindset ready for the SAT.
Sophie never realized how anxious she was about her schoolwork until she started working on her own at the rehabilitation facility. She was scared to flunk English and math because she really wanted to be the first in her family to go to college. She never realized it before, but her parents put a lot of pressure on her to succeed academically. With the help of her therapist, Sophie came to terms with her academic goals and created a realistic plan to help her get into college.
After schoolwork was done, Sophie went to the cork board to see what her chores were for the afternoon.
Chores were something Sophia actually looked forward to. She had a list of chores at home and having them at rehab gave her a sense of normalcy. For many teens with mental health issues, life has become unmanageable by the time they enter a rehabilitation program. They often cannot follow daily routines, including doing chores around the house. When this is the case, teens need to learn how to build structure and schedules into their daily lives.
Having assigned daily chores helps teens who need it understand the value of a routine. Most teens don’t realize that chores are a functional part of daily living, and they need to find a way to live functionally. Sophie particularly liked doing laundry and helping with the cooking. She had a roommate who loved washing dishes and vacuuming; and most of the boys had chores like taking out the trash, cutting the grass, or raking leaves.
In the rehabilitation environment, chores help teens prepare for the small stuff of daily living that seem overwhelming when they are dealing with mental health issues. And while therapy, school, and chores are essential parts of a daily schedule, there must also be time for recreation – it can even be therapeutic!
While Sophie was not always a social butterfly, she found out quickly that recreation time was a great opportunity for talking with others who found themselves in the same, desperate situation. Whether it was playing an organized game or just tossing a ball around, Sophie grew to look forward to recreation time.
Most facilities use some kind of recreational therapy as a therapeutic treatment option. It calls on the teens to use recreational skills to address limitations of the individual. These limitations are often psychological or social. But anything that prevents a person’s happiness and a person’s daily ability to function can be dealt with through recreational therapy.
Sophie, for example, was never athletic. But with the encouragement of her therapist and her groupmates, she started playing volleyball with some other residents. They never kept score – they just enjoyed playing the game. Sophie found after a few days of playing that she actually had some athletic bones in her body! This gave her self-esteem a great boost and also gave her something to talk about with the other teens at the facility.
This type of recreational therapy can improve a teen’s mental health, physical health, independence, relationships, and communication. Recreational therapy programs help reduce the side effects or symptoms of a mental health issue. They focus on improving all facets of a teen’s life.
Sophie’s 90 days were up. She was so happy to see her family, but, surprisingly, she was sad to leave behind the teens who had become her friends and support system. She was able to keep in touch with them via text and found that teen rehab was just what she needed to put her back on a path to success.",0.983828067779541,2409,2.978527069091797
"I have drawn on the 2019 fashion trend to create this animal print beaded bead bracelet. The pattern includes four different animal prints. So, you can use all or just some of them. Now, let me tell you a little more about this project.
You simply need seed beads to make your animal print beaded bead bracelet components. I used size 11, but this will also work with size 8 seed beads.
Each beaded bead needs just a few seed beads. So, this could be a good project for clearing some of your stash. You can keep to the traditional animal colours, or go a little wild. So, use your imagination as you decide on your materials.
If you are using up beads from your stash, then please make sure you use all beads of the same size and brand. As I explained in this blog, different brands of seed bead vary slightly in size. So, if you try to mix them, your beaded beads will come out a little wonky!
To make the complete bracelet, you also need:
- 20″ length of leather cord
- Two leather crimps
- A magnetic clasp
- Optional (depending on your crimps and clasp): two jump rings or split rings
For the beaded beads, you will just need a needle and scissors. You may want a pair of flat nose pliers for attaching the leather crimps.
Experience and Techniques
This animal print beaded bead bracelet is a beginner level project. You will use basic brick stitch to make your beaded beads. I have explained the technique in great detail and made the pattern charts very easy to follow.
So, you really don’t need any previous experience. I have also included instructions for attaching the crimps and clasp to your bracelet.
About the animal print beaded bead bracelet
I decided to try a few ‘on trend’ projects this year. So, experimenting with animal print designs came high on my list. Since I am also following my personal beaded bead challenge, this seemed like the perfect project.
Each beaded bead is quick to make. So, I was able to experiment with four different animal print designs. This pattern includes all four:
- Zebra stripe
- Tiger stripe
- Leopart print
- Giraffe print
If you are a more experienced beader, you can extend these patterns to create different pieces of animal print jewellery.
The leather cord wrap around bracelet is a trendy, yet casual, design that seemed to fit well with the animal print idea. So, you should be all set for summer with this project!",0.9384996891021729,534,1.6743842363357544
"House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, seen walking to the House chamber on Wednesday, says he has the votes needed to pass the GOP health care bill on Thursday.
House Republicans are bringing their health care bill back for a vote on Thursday. The American Health Care Act was pulled from the House floor just minutes before an expected vote in March, which was seen as a stark failure of Republicans on a key campaign promise.
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday evening that they are confident in having enough votes to pass the bill in its latest form early Thursday afternoon.
As they have tried to gather enough support to get their health care bill passed, Republican lawmakers keep adding pots of money to the proposal to pay the costs of people with high medical costs. The cash would very likely go to “high-risk pools,” which pay the expenses of the very sick so that insurance companies don’t have to.
The AHCA is the latest in a long line of attempts to transform the health care system. Those that have passed include Medicare, then Medicaid, and then Obamacare. Now we move to Trumpcare, or whatever it eventually is labeled, which seems to be turning into another big federal program to pay the bills for people with expensive illnesses.
House Speaker Paul Ryan made the case for high-risk pools on the Charlie Rose television show in January.
“By having taxpayers, I think, step up and focus on, through risk pools subsidizing care for people with catastrophic illnesses, those losses don’t have to be covered by everybody else [buying insurance] and we stabilize their plans,” Ryan said.
The original version of the House bill, called the American Health Care Act, includes a “Patient and State Stability Fund” with $100 billion over 10 years that would allow states to help defray their citizens’ health costs or lower their premiums.
Later amendments added an additional $30 billion to create a federal “invisible” high-risk pool, with money to reimburse insurers who cover patients with expensive illnesses and to pay for prenatal and childbirth care.
And on Tuesday night, Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., proposed adding an additional $8 billion over five years to ensure that sick people get adequate coverage through high-risk pools.
“It’s our understanding that the $8 billion over the five years will more than cover those that might be impacted,” Upton said Wednesday after a meeting at the White House. “And as a consequence, [it] keeps to our pledge for those that in fact would be otherwise denied because of pre-existing illnesses.”
Ryan says the goal of the Republican bill is to offer more and cheaper health insurance choices. By separating out those who have expensive medical conditions, the remaining customers for individual insurance could buy stripped-down policies with fewer benefits at a lower price.
Several states have tried high-risk pools in the past, but they were typically underfunded, leaving millions of people with no access to adequate health care. Lawmakers hope that by putting the heft and money of the federal government behind them, they may work better.
The federal government is already in the business. It pays for the health care of more than 40 percent of the population, through Medicare, Medicaid, the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs, according to the Census Bureau.
Medicare is essentially a giant high-risk pool. The program, which pays for health care for people over 65, was created in 1965 because that population couldn’t get affordable private health insurance precisely because their health costs were too high.
Last year the federal government spent about $591 billion on Medicare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Medicaid, which covers the poor or disabled, is essentially another high-risk pool, paid for with about $550 billion in tax money in 2016.
And then there’s the Veterans Health Administration, which pays for the care of many people who have served in the military.
Covering the people that commercial insurance left behind was also the goal of the Affordable Care Act.
The law was designed to ensure that people in the individual insurance market who have pre-existing medical conditions, who were often shut out of traditional insurance plans, could get coverage. Obamacare tries to achieve that goal by requiring everyone, sick and healthy, to buy insurance so that the cost is spread among a broad population.
That led to higher premiums for many people who are young and healthy because they subsidize those who are sicker and older, and also because they have to buy insurance with a generous menu of benefits mandated by the government.
The Republican plan aims to cut those premiums by getting rid of Obamacare rules requiring that policies offer a broad menu of benefits, including prescription coverage and maternity care; limit how much more companies can charge older people; and require insurers to charge the same price for people with existing medical conditions.
But many Republican members of Congress, including Upton, aren’t willing to see those with more medical needs shut out of the system once again.
“We’re talking about some way to finance a social goal that was established by the Affordable Care Act,” says Joe Antos, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. “I don’t think Republicans want to go back on that. They agree that we’ve turned that corner.”
Antos says the big difference between what’s being contemplated by the House Republicans this week and Medicare or other government health programs is that high-risk pools or subsidies would very likely still be run through private health insurers, which have incentives to save money and be efficient.
Zack Cooper, a professor of health policy and economics at Yale, agrees.
“Once you’ve decided to cover everybody, you’re sort of arguing over where the money comes from,” he says. “The ACA makes me subsidize you. The high-risk pools are simply doing that through taxation.”
So far the House GOP bill doesn’t require states to create high-risk pools, but some of the money is allocated specifically to that purpose. Such pools could be separate state-run insurance programs similar to traditional Medicare or Medicaid, or “invisible” systems where individuals buy their insurance on the regular market but the government pays the expenses of the people deemed high risk.
Maine has an invisible risk pool where insurance companies have to turn over to the state 90 percent of the premium paid by anyone the company deems high risk. That prevents companies from abusing the high-risk status, Antos says, because insurers would be forgoing income from patients who don’t have high medical costs.
After Maine established its high-risk pool, premiums for people in their 20s fell an average $5,000 a year, and people in their 60s saw their costs decline by about $7,000. At the same time, enrollment in private insurance rose, according to a study in Health Affairs.
The Republican bill doesn’t mandate a Maine-like system. And the flexibility in the bill, combined with limits on the money available, could be a problem, says Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Urban Institute. Especially since the pot of money is limited.
“We’re going to provide X dollars, then we’ll let the states figure out what benefits they can get for these people for the money that we’re providing,” Blumberg says.
Emily Gee, a health economist at the Democrat-allied Center for American Progress, says the Republican proposal needs about $20 billion more per year to adequately pay the costs of high-risk patients.
And that’s a real risk, says Yale’s Cooper.
Government has a track record of creating programs to help the needy but not funding them adequately to ensure that they offer quality services, he says. It’s a common complaint about Medicaid, where lawmakers frequently point out that it doesn’t pay doctors enough.
“This is trying to get people off the books,” Cooper says. “The fear is once you get them off the books, you forget about them.”",0.9738698601722717,1705,1.4264543056488037

"The Meat Industry Association (MIA) and Beef + Lamb NZ (B+LNZ) welcome China’s formal application to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).
Joint Media Release from the Meat Industry Association (MIA) and Beef + Lamb New Zealand (B+LNZ)
Sirma Karapeeva, chief executive of the MIA, said the application is an exciting and important development as New Zealand looks to trade to drive its economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Closer regional integration that includes such an important trading partner like China will allow New Zealand red meat companies to leverage supply chains and deepen their relationships with customers across this important region.
“The CPTPP was conceived with a vision for deeper regional integration and a closer more connected trading block within the Asia Pacific. The broad interest in membership and China’s formal application to join the agreement demonstrates that the CPTPP is delivering on this ambition.”
B+LNZ chief executive Sam McIvor said: “The New Zealand red meat sector is supportive of new members who can demonstrate that they are willing and able to meet the benchmark for high standards and ambition that the original members set for the CPTPP.
“The China-New Zealand FTA, and the recent upgrade, demonstrates the high quality and commitment to trade liberalisation that China is capable of and will be most welcome in a CPTPP context.
“Furthermore, the expansion of CPTPP is an important step in continuing to update and harmonise trade rules in the Asia-Pacific region. It sends an important message to the wider trade community, including the WTO, that trade rules continue to be important and there remains an appetite to expand these and build closer trade relationships.”

"Hope is the belief in a positive future. It is an optimistic, exciting sense of what is possible. In this time of global health crisis, economic uncertainty, racial reckoning, and physical disconnection from other human beings, the day to day challenges of doing everything differently make it difficult to hold onto hope. Yet hope is an antidote to despair. It can give us the energy to persevere and can offer a sense of purpose, calm and connection. Parents are children’s first hope builders. Your presence, connection, and attitude can help your child be more hopeful. They look to you to set their sail. Try some of these ideas to bring hope into your regular family practice.
- Name hope. Share examples of when you feel hopeful about something. Encourage your child to do the same. Notice how the positive energy of hope impacts the situation. What you have hope for may or may not turn out to be true, but the awareness and sense of hope is powerful.
- See their strengths. You want your children to be the best they can be, but often that results in noticing what is wrong, more than what is right. Spend some time thinking about who your child is. What are their strengths? What do you appreciate about them? Think about how their strengths will help them be adults that make the world a better place. Notice your child’s strengths out loud. Their belief in themselves and their capability will foster their hope.
- Avoid rescuing children. If they bump up against an obstacle, let them you know that you have faith that they can figure it out. Encourage them to work it out for themselves. This doesn’t mean abandonment, you can coach them or give them ideas Stay connected and interested…as a cheerleader rather than fixer.
- Talk about the future. Plan for the future. As new opportunities come up, discuss the possible outcomes. It is okay to be unsure, but find things that help you feel hopeful about the situation. Start a savings account that your whole family contributes to for a future outing together. Put things on the calendar for the future and model flexibility when plans need to be altered when the time comes.
- Start a hands-on project. Many of our hours these days are spent in the online world. Find a project to do with your kids that allows them to touch materials and use tools. It’s good for them to be a part of the beginning, middle and completion of something real that they can see and hold. This process from conception through to finished product inspires a sense of competence, accomplishment and control that inspires hope. Here are some ideas for DIY projects.
- Read, read, read. Books can be a wonderful resource for helping children build hope. There are lots of children’s stories about finding joy and connection on the other side of adversity.",0.9534762501716614,581,3.2196948528289795
"Hiring a Foreign Nanny or Household Worker in Turkey
February, 13th, 2024
Turkey, like most countries, has a shortage of local workers who are willing to be nannies and caregivers for elders. Many families therefore seek the services of a foreign national to fill these in-home roles to care for children or elderly parents. In Turkey, both foreigners and Turkish nationals often seek to employ a full-time live-in foreign household worker, and contrary to popular belief, work permits are possible. Given that residence permits do not grant work authorization, this article seeks to provide information on obtaining work permits for household employees.
The sponsoring employer who wishes to hire a full-time household employee, must apply for a work permit under their name and their specific residential address where the nanny will be employed. This work permit is exclusive to the designated address, meaning the nanny can not work at another address even if the sponsor employer is the same.
Criteria for Sponsoring a Nanny/Household Worker Work Permit
When considering hiring a nanny or household worker, the sponsor employer should meet the following criteria:
1. E-Signature: Acquiring an e-signature token is mandatory for filing the work permit application. Various e-signature providers in Turkey may provide this token that can be obtained by a Turkish national or foreigner with lawful status in Turkey.
2. Financial Eligibility: The sponsor must demonstrate sufficient financial income or means to support the nanny’s employment.
3. Minimum Salary Requirement: The nanny must be compensated at minimum wage or higher in Turkey, which is subject to periodic adjustments.
4. Purpose of Employment: The employment purpose must align with at least one of the following:
a. Child Care (children must be minors)
b. Elderly Care
c. Patient Care
The employment purpose must be specified in the employment agreement executed with the nanny as well as in the work permit application form. Note there are additional requirements for each purpose to evidence the requirement of a nanny. For instance, if the purpose of employment is to take care of minor children, the sponsor must provide the Turkish/Foreign ID Numbers of the children. Generally, if one of these conditions is well-evidenced in the application and no other negative conditions exist, the Ministry of Labor is quite willing to grant a permit.
Filing of the Work Permit Application
If the foreign nanny candidate in Turkey has a valid residence permit that allows them to legally reside in Turkey six months or more the sponsor can file a work permit application for the nanny domestically in Turkey. Processing time is between 1 – 2 months and once approved, the nanny must update their address registration to the employer’s address within 20 business days if they will be in a live-in position.
If the nanny does not possess a valid residence permit, they must apply for a work visa at the Turkish Consulate in their country of residence or citizenship. The Turkish Consulate will issue a reference number, enabling the sponsor employer in Turkey to file the work permit application. The nanny can enter Turkey to work only after their work permit is approved and they collect their work visa from the Turkish Consulate abroad. The nanny must complete their address registration within 20 business days of arrival.
Social Security Registration
After receiving work permit approval, to conclude the hiring process, the sponsor employer must notify the Turkish Social Security Institution (“SGK”) before the nanny commences employment. Proof of payment of social security premiums is an important step that is needed to renew the permit as well.
In conclusion, navigating the process of hiring a foreign nanny or household worker in Turkey requires careful attention to legal requirements and procedural details. The process as outlined requires obtaining an e-signature, ensuring the sponsor employer meets all necessary criteria, ensuring the applicant has no negative background issues, collecting required documents from both the nanny and employer, executing an employment agreement, filing the work permit in Turkey or from abroad, completing the address registration of the nanny, and finally notifying the social security institution about the commencement of employment. With this procedure, the Turkish government ensures families have the household staff they need while protecting the employment rights of the domestic employee.",0.9287735819816589,876,1.5480492115020752

"Will insurance cover breast reductions? For many women, the goal of undergoing breast reduction surgery is to alleviate unwanted symptoms caused by their breast size. In these cases, the patients tend to believe that the procedure is reconstructive rather than cosmetic and as a result, insurance should cover it. Unfortunately, however, this is not always the case. Breast reduction is generally considered to be a cosmetic procedure by most insurance companies. In some circumstances, insurance may cover the cost of the procedure. We outlined what you will need to show your insurance company to have your surgery covered. Read on to learn more!
What is breast reduction surgery?
Breast reduction surgery, medically referred to as reduction mammaplasty, helps women who suffer symptoms from overly large breasts. Many women develop back, shoulder, and neck problems due to their breast size. In addition, some find everyday tasks difficult or suffer from constant rashes or nerve pain. Breast reduction surgery can help in these specific cases. In this procedure, the surgeon removes excess fat, skin, and tissue to achieve the desired cup size.
How much does a breast reduction cost?
The cost of breast reduction surgery varies. There are many factors that influence the cost of the procedure. These factors fluctuate based on the location of your surgery as well as the years of experience and expertise of your doctor. Below are the factors you should consider.
- Anesthesia costs
- Location of the procedure
- Hospital costs
- Doctor’s fee
- Medical tests
According to statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons from 2018, the average cost of a breast reduction is $5,680. However, this number only reflects patients who had breast reduction for aesthetic purposes.
Will my insurance cover breast reduction surgery?
As mentioned, most patients believe that if surgery is considered reconstructive or medically necessary, it will be covered by health insurance. In the same vein, if a procedure is considered cosmetic, it will not be covered.
In the case of breast reduction surgery, most insurance companies consider it to be a cosmetic procedure. This can change if the patient can prove that they suffer from many health issues. The patient must also prove that she attempted multiple other ways to fix those issues prior to undergoing corrective surgery. If you make a strong enough case to your insurance company, it may then be considered a reconstructive procedure. As a result, the company will cover your procedure.
It is important to note that this is becoming rarer and rarer. Every insurance company has a different set of standards that would deem the surgery reconstructive. This inconsistency makes it difficult for plastic surgeons to know if they can help their patients receive this financial relief.
To know for sure if your insurance carrier will cover your procedure, call a representative. He or she can talk you through the carrier’s specific requirements for covering breast reduction. On average, it takes between three to six months of preparation with your insurance carrier to have it covered. This might include mandatory secondary consultations with other healthcare providers to confirm that the procedure is medically necessary. It could also include physical therapy or chiropractic care to qualify for insurance coverage for breast reduction.
If insurance covers the procedure, you will still be responsible for the deductible and any copays.
Quick tips for breast reduction insurance coverage
- Read your insurance coverage materials. The carrier’s online resources for your particular level and type of health insurance coverage will clarify if the procedure can be covered.
- Reach out to your insurance carrier. While doing your own research is important, don’t depend solely on your own interpretation of the carrier’s rules. Call your insurance company and see if pre-approval is required for breast reduction surgery. Find out what documentation your insurance carrier requires from your physician to establish medical necessity. In addition, if a second medical or surgical opinion may be necessary before approving coverage for your breast reduction. Finally, ask if the carrier must choose the physician for your second opinion.
- Find out about in-network vs. out-of-network doctors. Having a surgeon that you trust performing your breast reduction is crucial to a successful outcome that you will love. However, if you have a network restriction that limits your choice of surgeons, you might want to find out if you can use the plastic surgeon of your choice. Some companies allow out-of-network procedures at a reduced rate of coverage, while some companies disallow out-of-network care in non-emergency situations.

With a deep commitment to kindness and empowerment, Cheryll’s work continues to pave the way for innovative solutions that benefit communities worldwide.
The Early Days: Laying the Foundation
Cheryll Rogers’ journey towards becoming a leading figure in strategic philanthropy and social impact began in her early years in Cardiff, Wales. She attended Whitchurch High School, where she developed a strong sense of community and a passion for helping others. These formative years instilled in her the values of kindness, empathy, and a commitment to making a difference—principles that would later guide her career.
From a young age, Cheryll was drawn to understanding the human experience. This curiosity led her to pursue a path in psychotherapy and counselling, where she could explore the complexities of human behavior and provide support to those in need. Her educational journey was marked by a dedication to personal and professional growth, setting the stage for her future endeavors in leadership and philanthropy.
Entering the World of Counselling and Coaching
Cheryll’s professional career began with a focus on mental health and wellness.

"Researchers Sharpen DNA Mapping
Tue, 10/08/2024 - 11:12am
Proof-of-concept experiments in the Rice lab of chemist Christy Landes identified DNA sequences as short as 50 nucleotides at room temperature, a feat she said is impossible with standard microscopes that cannot see targets that small, or electron microscopes that require targets to be in a vacuum or cryogenically frozen.
The technique called “super-localization microscopy” has been known for a while, Landes said, but its application in biosensing is just beginning. Scientists have seen individual double-stranded DNA molecules under optical microscopes for years, but the ability to see single-stranded DNA is a new achievement, and breaking the diffraction limit of light adds value, she said.
The work by Landes, Rice postdoctoral associate Jixin Chen and undergraduate student Alberto Bremauntz is detailed in the American Chemical Society journal Applied Materials and Interfaces.
The Rice researchers call their super-resolution technique “motion blur point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography” (mbPAINT). With it, they resolved structures as small as 30 nanometers (billionths of a meter) by making, essentially, a movie of fluorescent DNA probes flowing over a known target sequence along an immobilized single strand of DNA.
The probes are labeled with a fluorescent dye that lights up only when attached to the target DNA. In the experimental setup, most would flow by unseen, but some would bind to the target for a few milliseconds, just long enough to be captured by the camera before the moving liquid pulled them away. Processing images of these brief events amidst the background blur allows the researchers to image objects smaller than the natural diffraction limits of light-based imaging, which do not allow for the resolution of targets smaller than the wavelength of light used to illuminate them.
Even the Landes lab’s system is subject to these physical limitations. Individual images of fluorescing probes on targets are just a pixelated blur. But it’s a blur with a bright spot, and careful analysis of multiple images allows the researchers to pinpoint that spot along the strand.
“The probes are moving so fast that in real time, all we would see with the camera is a line,” Chen said. But when the camera firing at 30-millisecond intervals happened to catch a bound probe, it clearly stood out. The probes sometime picked out two sequences along a strand that would have been seen as a single blur via regular fluorescent microscopy.
Landes said one goal for mbPAINT is to map ever-smaller fragments of DNA. “Eventually, we’d like to get down to a couple of nucleotides,” she said. “Some diseases are characterized by one amino acid mutation, which is three nucleotides, and there are many diseases associated with very small genetic mutations that we’d like to be able to identify.
“We’re thinking this method will be ideally suited for diseases associated with small, localized mutations that are not possible to detect in any other inexpensive way,” she said.
Landes sees mpPAINT as not only more cost-effective but also able to capture information electron microscopes cannot.
“One of the reasons people invented electron microscopy is to image objects smaller than light’s diffraction limit, because biomolecules such as proteins and DNAs are smaller than that,” she said. “But electron microscopy requires cryogenic temperatures or a vacuum. You can’t easily watch things react in solution.
“The advent of this technology allows us to see the biological processes of nano-sized objects as they happen in water, with buffers and salts, at room temperature, at body temperature or even in a cell. It’s very exciting,” Landes said.
Rice graduate students Lydia Kisley and Bo Shaung are co-authors of the paper.

"A warning has been issued from the chairman of South Korea’s top financial regulator, that a new financial law can cause major problems as early as September.
Things are about to get tricky for all 200 cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea. Last week, the country’s National Assembly’s Political Affairs Committee held a general meeting.
Following the meeting, the chairman of South Korea’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), Eun Sung-soo, issued a warning that all of the exchanges in the country are at risk of being shut down.
Under the new and revised Special Funds Act (Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information,) all cryptocurrency exchanges are required to be registered with the FSC.
“We are now accepting applications for them to officially register their business by the timeline, but no exchange operators have applied to date,” Chairman Eun explained.
Considering none of them have applied for registration, they were warned that they could be shut down in September.
The bill in question is the new and “improved” Special Funds Act that went into effect on March 25. After allowing a mandatory 6 months grace period, it will be properly enforced, starting September 24.
Tougher Requirements on Crypto Providers
When it comes to the new rules, the Special Funds Act will require any cryptocurrency providers, this includes crypto exchanges, to obtain a certification of Information Security Management System (ISMS) in addition to the issuance of real-name accounts.
In order for the exchanges to meet the new requirements, the FSC is in charge of the registration. This has caused concern among many about being able to meet the new requirements, one major issue being the real-name accounts.
Danger in Price Fluctuations
FSC communicated that profits from any cryptocurrency investment will be up for taxation, beginning year 2022. This was already announced back in February, when the Ministry of Strategy and Finance revealed that income that is generated from crypto transactions will be classified as other income and will therefore also be taxed at a rate of 20%.
Government Reminding Of Previous Warnings
Although the latest news may come as a shock for many, it shouldn’t. The FSC Chairman told the South Korean press that crypto currencies are not considered real currencies and reminded the public that the government has repeatedly warned investors about the dangers of sudden price fluctuations.
There Is Still Time
Considering there is still time left on the clock to get their affairs in order before September, the revised bill should not have to cause all 200 crypto exchanges to shut down, but there is definitely a big risk of some of them being affected.",0.9631561636924744,547,1.4322048425674438
"I praise the Godhead, Unity in three Persons: for the Father is Light, the Son is Light, and the Spirit is Light, but the Light remains undivided, shining forth in oneness of Nature, yet in the three rays of the Persons… Let all the trees of the forest dance and sing, as they beheld their fellow-tree, the Cross, today receive veneration: for Christ, as Holy David prophesied, has exalted it on high… Glory to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

Nature’s resilience is amazing.
People’s resilience is astounding!

Lent is a spiritual springtime… The world of nature is coming alive round us during the Lenten season. And this should be a symbol of what is to happen in our own hearts. The dawning of springtime… We shouldn’t just have a negative idea of repentance, as feeling sorry, gloomy and somber about our failings. But repentance, rather, is new hope. An opening flower. How our lives can, by God’s grace, be changed. ~ Metropolitan Kallistos Ware
As the field is adorned by a multitude of flowers, so should the field of my own soul be adorned by all the flowers of virtue… ~ St. John of Kronstadt, My Life in Christ
If you do not shatter and empty your Ego, how will you make room for God?… God’s gifts to us blossom only if watered with the water of Love… Those who love can do only beautiful things. ~ St. Gavrilia
Heading towards the end of the second week of Great Lent, I’m hunkering down and holding fast (with God’s help), hoping to cultivate the spiritual springtime’s fragrant flowers of virtue, and to Blossom Forth!
Fragrant, plumeria blossom falls to rest on neighbouring Heliconia Rostrata leaf (Hanging Lobster Claw Flower) ~ Kauai 2023
Every flower is fragrant through the power of the Holy Spirit, in a delicate flow of aroma and tenderness of colour; the beauty of the Great contained in what is small. ~Akathist Glory to God for All Things, Kontakion 3
Without winter there would be no spring, and without spring there would be no summer. So it is also in the spiritual life: a little consolation, and then a little grief-and thus little by little we work out our salvation. Let us accept everything from the hand of God. ~St. Joseph the Hesychast
Everything that God has created is beautiful!
Even the flowers are full of grace!

Today is also the annual feast of the Wonderworking Icon of the Inexhaustible Cup(Chalice). The Icon’s Akathist to the Theotokos for help with the struggle of various addictions is here.
Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings.~ Psalm 17:8
He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. ~ Deuteronomy 32:10
Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.~ Proverbs 7:2
The expression of being the apple of one’s eye comes from the Old Testament, and is translated from Hebrew as little man of his eye… the reflection one sees in the eye of another. In early English translations of the Bible, the phrase appears as apple of his eye. This is derived from the Old English word aeppel, meaning either apple and/or an eye’s pupil. The phrase developed into apple of one’s eye, retaining the original meaning of something being both highly cherished and greatly treasured.
God does not create a cross for man. No matter how heavy a cross a man may carry in his life, it is still just wood, from which man himself made, and it always grows from the soil of his heart. ~ St. Ambrose of Optina
The Most Holy Mother of God prays for us ceaselessly. She is always visiting us. Whenever we turn to her in our heart, she is there. After the Lord, she is the greatest protection for mankind… She is constantly, by our side, and all too often we forget her. ~ Elder Thaddeus of Vitovnica
As long as they (Christ’s Disciples) were in Palestine, holy Mary spent time with them, helping them confirm themselves in the Saviour’s commandments, encouraging them to all goodness and cheering them. But when the disciples departed from Palestine to distant lands alien and unknown, She remained in John’s house. She did not waste Her time with trifles, but used every minute for the benefit of mankind, the very human race that crucified Her innocent Son! She dedicated her labours and care to visiting the sick and the imprisoned; she comforted, taught, and instructed anyone who needed support or counsel. She lived strictly according to Her Son’s commandments and therefore she could assuage people’s sorrows. She was a source of healing, and shade, and all who drew from that source felt freshness and relief and were fortified by heavenly love. The good works to which she entrusted Herself filled her soul with great blessedness and consolation, which were the reward for the woes and calamities she previously bore. For only after Her Son was resurrected did her eyes open to what had happened, and hope arrived. ~ St. Nikolai Velimirovic (Excerpt fromThe Theotokos on Her Deathbed)
An old English name for the Hosta garden plant, is the Assumption Lily, as it blooms close to the Dormition.
The liturgical colour for feasts honouring the Theotokos is blue. The clergy wear blue vestments, and the faithful sometimes wear a bit of blue too, in her honour. In icons, while her veil is red…the colour of divinity, as she is the Theo(God) tokos(Bearer), her clothes under the veil are green or blue, the colours of humanity. Also, upon her veil, are three stars, which represent her eternal virginity: before, during, and forever after the birth of Our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, she remained a pure virgin. At weddings it is still traditional to wear “a little something blue” in honour of the Theotokos.
St. Ambrose Bishop of Milan (330-397), wrote: “Mary’s life, is a rule of life for all.” …It is important that as Orthodox Christians we know and examine the life of the Theotokos who, after Christ Jesus, so influenced every creature, both the bodiless ones and the earthborn, before, during, and after her earthly sojourn. ~ From The Life of The Virgin Mary, The Theotokos, written and compiled by Holy Apostles Convent
Troparion Tone 1: In giving birth thou didst preserve thy virginity, and in thy falling asleep thou hast not forsaken the world, O Theotokos. Thou hast been translated unto life, for thou art the Mother of Life, and by thy supplications, thou dost deliver our souls from death.
Kontakion Tone 2: The tomb, nor mortality could not hold the Theotokos, who istireless her prayers and supplications. For, as the Mother of Life, she was translated unto life, by Him Who dwelt within her Ever-Virgin womb.
Hold on tightly as possible to the Robe of our Great Lady the Theotokos, that she might help you. May the Theotokos, the tender and caring Mother of the entire world, protect you and the entire world. ~ St. Paisios
As the earth, long awaiting moistening and at last receiving it in abundance, suddenly is covered by tender and bright greenery, so also the heart, exhausted by dryness, and afterwards revived by tears, emits from itself a multitude of spiritual thoughts and feelings, adorned by the common flower of humility.~ St. Ignatius Brianchaninov
If our thoughts are kind, peaceful, and quiet, turned only to the good, then we also influence ourselves and radiate peace all around us – in our family, the whole country, everywhere. This is true not only here on earth, but in the cosmos as well. When we labour in the fields of the Lord, we create harmony. Divine harmony, peace, and quiet spread everywhere.~ Elder Thaddeus of Vitnovica",0.9400675892829895,2407,0.9846698641777039
"Bushfire Sense and Nonsense By Viv Forbes
Bushfires are normal events in this season in tropical and sub-tropical latitudes of the southern hemisphere – in Australia, Africa and South America. Even Captain Cook noted many fires in Eastern Australia in 1770, long before the era of “global warming” hysteria. What is unusual is the number and ferocity of recent Australian fires. Destructive bushfires need three things – a big load of dry fuel, hot dry winds and a point of ignition. A big load of dry fuel, close to towns and buildings, in this season, is a sign of gross mis-management (seen most commonly in public lands). That fuel should have been raked, dozed or burnt in safer weather conditions. Hot dry winds are not unusual in this season in these latitudes – no use whinging. But how do 100+ bushfires start suddenly? Machinery occasionally starts fires but not 120 fires in a short time. There have been no lightning storms so who are the arsonists or idiots starting these fires?",0.928580641746521,216,2.612044334411621
"The Los Cabos Big Game Charter Boat Classic returns November 15th – 18th to the southern tip of Baja again this year. This relatively new event is sponsored by the Los Cabos Tourism Board and managed by Bonnier Corporation. Bonnier is the publisher of Sport Fishing magazine, Marlin magazine and many other outdoor titles. The 4 day event serves as a celebration of the fishery and as a thank you to anglers of all skill levels for supporting the vibrant Los Cabos area. The tournament is designed for anyone and everyone from serious anglers to weekend warriors and even first time anglers. Part of the reason the tournament is so inclusive is because of the low barrier to entry. In fact, it’s FREE! The event host, manager, and sponsors put up the entire $10,000 a day in cash prizes (for a total of $40,000).
9 cash prizes are awarded each day for 4 days, there is even a tournament style weigh in for the boats returning to the dock every afternoon. A winner is chosen each day for catching the largest 3 tuna, wahoo, and dorado. The angler who catches the biggest fish in each category on each day will take home $1,800, the runner up will be awarded $900, and the angler in third place will get $635. Registration is currently open!
However, the cash prizes are not the only awards that anglers are competing over. There is a billfish release category, anglers must email photos or videos of the release, and every angler who participates will get a certificate and be entered in a drawing for special prizes. Since many of the anglers competing in the tournament are new to the sport (or new to big game fishing), the billfish release division is a great way to teach anglers that catch and release is standard for billfish. There are also trophies for the lady angler and junior angler (under 17) who catch the largest fish each day. A slew of other prizes are provided by the event sponsors including Lucas Marine Products, Aftco, King Sailfish Mounts, Carey Chen, Yeti, Berkley, Penn, Costa Sunglasses, and more.
To make the tournament even more inclusive they have arranged for weigh-ins at three locations. Anglers fishing out of the East Cape can bring their fish to the Hotel Buena Vista Beach Resort, in San José del Cabo the weigh-in is at the Puerto Los Cabos Palapas, and in Cabo San Lucas at the Marina Fundadores Weigh-Gantry.
The only requirement to enter the tournament is that you are an amateur angler or a professional angler that does not work in the Los Cabos or East Cape area. Anglers in the tournament must also be fishing on a licensed charter boat. The charter boats range from 20′ pangas to 40′ sport fishers (and larger). Beyond these requirements there are not many rules, anglers may pass the rod, receive assistance, etc… Fishing is from 7am until 2:30pm each day to mimic typical charter boat operations.
Bonnier Corporation and the Los Cabos Tourism Board are expecting more than 400 anglers to fish the tournament on around 130 different charter boats. There will be a diverse group of participants from all over the world, but especially Mexico, the US, and Europe. Registration is open now as well as every evening during the tournament for fishing the following day.
As the only free anglers event in Los Cabos it draws crowds of anglers with a fresh and energetic approach to competitive fishing. Past participants note that the event added a lot of fun to the day, from the thrill of the contest to seeing the weigh ins etc…. The week before Thanksgiving is also a great time to visit Los Cabos, since it is after the peak season flights, charters, and hotels are more reasonably priced but the weather is perfect and the fishing is excellent.
Plan your next vacation around the Los Cabos Big Game Charter Boat Classic and find out why this event is gaining so much popularity through word of mouth and rapidly growing every year.

"Tired of answering the same support questions over and over and over again? A knowledge base is the answer.
He was a founder at a small tech startup that was just gaining traction.
I was a freelance writer.
His company was adding customers daily, which was great—but also a problem.
More customers meant more support emails, and he was starting to get overwhelmed.
“Can you help us create some support articles?” he asked. “I can’t keep answering the same questions over and over by email every day.”
As we learned first-hand from that experience, creating a knowledge base is one of the highest ROI investments you can make.
A knowledge base is sometimes called a support site, help center, or FAQ, but whatever you call it, it’s one of the best ways to reduce the support burden on your company, especially if you’re a founder responding to support requests on your own.
In this article, we’ll go through the basics of a knowledge base, how creating one can help you, and what you need to know to get started.
We’ll also show you how to easily set up a knowledge base for your company and begin publishing articles.
Depending on what tools you choose, setup can be less than 15 minutes, and your first few articles can be live within a couple of hours.
Note: Every Groove account includes our easy-to-use knowledge base at no additional cost. Setup takes about 15 minutes, and you can have your first articles published within an hour. Try it today—free for 7 days (no credit card required).
What is a knowledge base? (And how can it help me?)
Here’s a simple definition of a knowledge base:
Knowledge base (aka FAQ, help center, support site): A self-service collection of support articles that empower customers to find answers to questions on their own—reliving you from having to answer the same questions over and over again through email.
The benefits of a knowledge base are:
- Fewer support queries to your inbox (we consistently see 33% fewer emails for most of our customers)
- Happier customers
- Lower costs (because you can spend less time and resources on support)
Think of a knowledge base as a self-service support channel—a way for customers to get help now for questions that would otherwise require an email or chat request to you (or your support team).
A knowledge base also helps you save time answering support queries—because instead of writing new responses to every question, you can direct users to pre-written resources in your knowledge base.
Combine that with canned replies and you can provide customers detailed answers in just a few seconds—instead of 5-10 minutes per email writing new responses every time you get the same question.
And finally, customers like being able to find their own answers.
More than six in 10 U.S. consumers say that their go-to channel for simple inquiries is a digital self-serve tool. (source)
How to set up a self-service knowledge base
In less than an hour, you can set up a knowledge base, publish your first few articles, and relieve the pressure on your support inbox.
1. Document the 5 to 10 support questions you get asked most frequently
Your knowledge base doesn’t have to answer every question that’s ever been asked by a customer.
If you have that mindset, you’ll feel like you have to write 1,000 knowledge base articles—and you’ll never get started.
Instead, start by simply documenting the top 5 to 10 questions you get asked by questions in your support inbox.
Every company has these—the questions that come up again and again.
Maybe you already have canned replies set up for some of these that you can cut and paste into your responses.
Whatever these 5 to 10 questions are for you, put them into a list.
This is where we’ll start.
2. Set up a knowledge base
Some companies choose to set up a separate subdomain for their support pages using a CMS such as WordPress. While effective, this option will require either technical knowledge or assistance from a developer.
Another option is to set up knowledge base software like the kind we offer at Groove.
We believe so much in the importance of a knowledge base that we include KB software at no additional cost with every Groove subscription.
In addition, our 7-day free trial means you can thoroughly evaluate the software to see if it will work for you.
Setup is as easy as signing up, connecting your email, and choosing one of our pre-built design templates—all of which can be done in less than 15 minutes.
3. Answer each question as thoroughly as possible
Now that you have a knowledge base in place, take the list of 5 to 10 questions you created earlier and answer each one in the form of an article.
For example, here at Groove, one of the common questions we get asked is how to onboard new users when adding a new employee.
For that, we’ve created an article anyone can use as a resource:
Knowledge base articles do not need to be lengthy. Many of ours are less than 500 words.
They simply need to answer the customer’s question thoroughly and clearly.
4. Add images, animated GIFs, and videos
They say an image is worth a thousand words, and that’s certainly true with knowledge base resources.
In many cases, adding screenshots, images, animated GIFs, and videos will help your customers far more than lengthy text-only descriptions.
Some people will read every word on a support page, but others are more visual and prefer to watch or see your suggestions in an image or a video.
Groove’s knowledge base software lets you easily add digital media resources directly into your articles, and we use them often.
A few resources to help you create images, GIFs, and media are:
- CloudApp: A free tool for easily taking and sharing screenshots
- Nimbus Capture: a browser extension for taking screenshots of a full webpage, including what’s “below the fold”
- Loom: An easy way to record videos while sharing your screen
- Camtasia: A full-featured video editing tool that we often use for screen recording and to create animated GIFs
- Photoshop: For professional-quality image editing.
For videos, you’ll need to choose a host to store your video files, then embed them within your knowledge base articles.
We currently use Wistia to host our video files, but you can also use services such as YouTube or Vimeo if you prefer.
5. (Optional) Organize your questions into categories
When you only have 5 to 10 articles, you probably don’t need categories.
But as you add articles, it’ll make sense to add categories to help people find what they’re looking for.
Categories also form the primary navigation on your knowledge base home page.
You can choose whatever categories you prefer, but don’t make them too complex at the start.
Just group your articles into 2 or 3 categories at the start, and you can add more as you add new resources.
Adding to your knowledge base
As you continue to provide support, keep documenting the questions you get asked the most.
Anything that comes up three times is probably a good candidate for a knowledge base article. If that many customers are asking you about it, it’s a signal that other users probably have the same question as well.
Keeping your knowledge base current
For software companies like ours, we have a regular meeting between our development and customer success team to identify any new features that will require changes to our existing documentation.
If you do this regularly, it won’t require more than a little bit of time every month or every quarter. But that time is among the most important tasks you’ll have moving forward when it comes to a knowledge base.
Because it does you no good to have a knowledge base only for it to be out of date and not helpful to your customers.
We recommend reviewing your knowledge base articles every 6 to 12 months, depending on how quickly you make changes to your product.
Knowledge Base reports can also show you article performance and information about what customers are searching, including failed searches—an easy way to find ideas for new articles you can create to help your customers.
What’s the payoff for a highly-useful knowledge base?
Your time, specifically.
Groove’s knowledge base and Inbox products are used most commonly by founders, or small support teams.
“Lack of time” or “too much to do” or “not enough people” is the No. 1 problem we hear from the people we talk to.
A knowledge base gives you time back.
Without one, someone at your company (maybe you) will need to reply to similar questions getting asked over and over again by customers.
If you want to slash the number of support requests you get from customers, set up a knowledge base today.
If you’re already too busy for your own good, it’s one of the highest ROI actions you can take.",0.950045645236969,1961,1.3831709623336792
"Fifty episodes in to InTek Freight & Logistics: The Podcast, a returning guest brings his intermodal expertise to help check in on the state of the market. Known as the ""Intermodalist,"" Larry Gross is the President and Founder of Gross Transportation Consulting, this year's IANA Silver Kingpin Award Winner, and a returning guest - check out episode five for more on his background.
For this edition, Larry tells us what the numbers are saying about the intermodal market as the year winds down, how port (and import) related intermodal activity is outpacing domestic intermodal, how the mode is doing versus truckload, and how intermodal is doing compared to its norms. Plus, we look ahead to 2025 and the factors that could affect intermodal - and the economy in general - moving forward, like President-Elect Trump's proposed tariff policies, a once-again impending East Coast port strike, continued Red Sea/Suez Canal unrest, and potential ""black swan"" events to be determined.
We also spend time south of the border to discuss intermodal in Mexico, as well as for cross-border freight. Larry tells us that while the numbers are not showing tremendous growth for cross-border intermodal, the way the market is behaving suggests otherwise. He does note that intermodal within the country is growing at a very strong rate.
For more from Larry, visit intermodalindepth.com, where you can subscribe to his Intermodal In-Depth reports and find other services he offers. You can also regularly find his Intermodal Analyzed webinars through IANA.

Aligning financial performance and climate in active fixed income
Positive climate impacts and financial returns are not incompatible. This is how LGIM’s AFI team factors climate change into our portfolios.
The following blog is an extract from our article: Moving toward future-proof portfolios: Aligning financial performance and climate in active fixed income.
2023 was the hottest year on record, with extreme weather events becoming far more frequent. We believe investors have a crucial role to play in driving the transition to a low-carbon economy and mitigating climate-related risks.
How should an investor balance a focus on reducing the negative climate impacts of their investments with a desire for financial returns?
This negative framing of the climate question is evident to many investors, who see balancing carbon and returns as an increasing challenge. However, it is our firm belief that instead of framing the challenges and opportunities of the energy transition in these terms, investors could be asking a different, more positive question: how can these opportunities and risks be addressed simultaneously?
In fact, we believe that addressing the opportunities and risks created by the energy transition to help target positive impacts on climate outcomes can be closely aligned with a focus on long-term returns. However, far from maximising the potential value created by the transition, in our view many companies are still failing to transition at an optimal pace.
It’s the combination of the negative framing of the climate question and the slow transition progress of many companies that, in our view, create such a significant opportunity for active investors to have both a positive impact on climate outcomes and also target returns. On the one hand, many still misunderstand the fundamentally economic nature of decarbonisation – leading to the possibility of material mispricing for investors to take advantage of as they seek to reduce their climate impact; on the other hand, there is a window of opportunity for investors to engage with and positively influence those companies who continue to underperform their real climate potential.
Net zero or SDGs?
Recently, we have observed that many investors with sustainability priorities have been coalescing their efforts around one of two approaches - investments which focus on a climate-focussed ambition of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and the multi-faceted UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that include climate but also extend to many other environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations.
Our net zero framework primarily focuses on carbon in the value chains of its constituent companies, especially coal extraction or power generation, and alignment with LGIM’s Climate Impact Pledge. Underpinning our net zero framework is LGIM's Destination@Risk model, which we will explore in more detail later in this document. This model enables us to robustly measure the climate risk embedded in the portfolio and its climate alignment. It combines decarbonisation objectives based on backward-looking data and an objective based on forward-looking data (temperature alignment). This allows us to assess climate and transition risk in a way which overlays additional, independent insight to the data which is most commonly available from third-party agencies. Drawing on the energy scenario insights of this framework, the relevant strategies target a 1.5C alignment by 2030.

"Alô, alô Mozilla, aquele abraço!
Editor’s Note: I’d like to share a guest post from Ronaldo Lemos and Bruno Magrani of the Center for Technology & Society at FGV Law School, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Next week, Mozilla will participate in the 9th Fórum Internacional do Software Livre (International Free Software Forum – FISL) in Porto Alegre, Brazil. This is the second time that Mozilla will be in Brazil on an “official” visit. This time, the group includes Mitchell Baker (Mozilla’s Chairperson), Chris Blizzard, Marcio Galli, Mary Colvig, Taras Glek and Chris Hofmann. In their visit, they will be in touch with a vibrant and growing community of free software users, developers and enthusiasts. This is a great opportunity both for Mozilla and for the Brazilian community to get together and work with Firefox and other initiatives that promote the core values of the net, including openness and freedom.
Ronaldo Lemos and I have been helping support Mozilla’s presence here in Brazil and at FISL. This is not the first time that our institution, the Center for Technology & Society at the FGV Law School in Rio de Janeiro has participated in the Forum. We’ve worked closely with FISL in the past few years and we launched the Brazilian branch of the Creative Commons project at the Forum in March 2004. This was an unforgettable event, I believe both for us, and for the more than 1,500 participants attending the launch, anxious to hear Minister Gilberto Gil, Marcelo Tas, Terry Fisher, Lawrence Lessig, Luis Nassif, André Midani, Claudio Prado, Joaquim Falcão, and so many others who care a lot about the future of the internet. A video of the launch can be watched here.
This year we are very happy to be back again at the Free Software Forum (this will be our 4th year at the event). Besides organizing/participating in a few panels, we will be there to support Mozilla´s visit the best way we can, including their workshop. We are very honored to do this, especially because we believe Mozilla will find in Brazil a place where not only we share common values, but also, put them into practice, thanks to our natural “tropicalist” mindset, and to the fact that the meaning of “openness” is very strong for us. One symbol of that is the fact that President Lula is expected at the Forum this year, and Brazil is well-known worldwide for its support of free software and free culture. Without further ado, we look forward to a great conference and Mozilla visit!",0.9309054017066956,578,1.1602485179901123

Client relationships are the backbone of the marketing industry. Building strong relationships with clients is essential for long-term success and growth. When marketing agencies have strong client relationships, they are more likely to retain clients, receive referrals, and win new business.
Client relationships matter in marketing for several reasons. Firstly, satisfied clients are more likely to continue working with an agency and provide repeat business. This leads to increased revenue and stability for the agency. Secondly, happy clients are more likely to refer the agency to others, which can result in new business opportunities. Lastly, building strong client relationships helps agencies understand their clients’ needs and preferences better, allowing them to deliver more targeted and effective marketing campaigns.
However, maintaining client relationships can be challenging for marketing agencies. They often have multiple clients with different needs and expectations. Managing these relationships manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This is where SMS-iT CRM comes in.

"Review your presentation
Does your page still reflect your project? Is it not a reflection of what it was a year ago, two years ago, or even more? Updating your page regularly is essential, as it allows you to explain the constraints you face, the new needs that have arisen or the objectives that will drive you in the coming months. In short, this is the best way to keep your Tipeee page up to date, both convincing and exciting for your community.
Tailor your rewards
You may have noticed that some of the rewards on your page are particularly appealing to your community… or particularly not! This is the perfect time to take a look at your rewards, in order to relaunch your communication with an updated selection of rewards.
New: you can now set up your rewards to automatically send links and files by email, or to assign a role to your Tippers on your Discord server.
Update your goals
The “Goals” module available on your Tipeee page is used to explain your needs to your future Tippers, but also and above all to convince them that their donation will serve to improve your project, your working conditions, etc. As with the presentation, it is therefore essential that the objectives shown on your page are in line with your needs at the current time and in the months to come! Don’t forget that setting structural objectives, expressed in euros per month, will be much more effective in encouraging your community to support you on a long-term basis, with a recurring Tip.
Set up your stream alerts
Whether you’re a seasoned streamer or a newcomer, you’ll probably learn nothing from us when we tell you that these moments of live exchange with your community are likely to bring you new Tips. The “Streaming” section of your Creator page offers you various resources to promote your Tipeee campaign during your streams. Compatible with the main streaming software (Streamlabs, OBS, Xsplit, etc.), these widgets will allow you to showcase the donations made during your live streams and to thank your Tippers live!
Integrate Tipeee as a means of payment on your website
This is one of the new features on Tipeee this fall: you can now integrate a Tipeee payment module directly into your website or blog, so that your readers can support you without ever leaving your world! This module is available in an iFrame or pop-in version, and you can integrate it into your site’s layout in just a few clicks: on the home page, at the bottom of articles, in a page dedicated to donations, etc.
By integrating the hosted payment on your site, you spare your community from having to make a stop by your page on Tipeee, and therefore multiply the chances of receiving Tips.
Bring your projects to life
Another new feature this fall: you can now create a Tipeee page focused on a specific objective! These new pages, which are more similar to “classic” crowdfunding, will allow you to promote and finance a specific project, such as a new concept, a complete season, exceptional content, a book, but also a material investment, a physical event, etc.
Launching your fundraising is done in a few clicks, and you can launch this page with the same Tipeee account (and therefore the same information) as your “regular” Tipeee page.
Do you have questions about how Tipeee works or a problem with the site? For all your technical questions, write to us at firstname.lastname@example.org, and we will be happy to answer you within 48 working hours.",0.9479389786720276,761,1.0038541555404663
"Fishing is a hobby enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. When heading out onto the water, there are a few basic pieces of equipment needed to ensure a successful trip. Fishing can be as expensive or as inexpensive a hobby as you want.
A fishing pole is an essential part of your fishing gear and of your fishing trip. The fishing line goes from the pole into the water.
A fishing reel is attached to a pole and allows an angler to cast out the bait and reel it back in with a fish. Spinning, bait-cast, spin-cast and fly are popular types of reels.
Fishing line is also needed to get the bait and hook into the water. There are several different types, including monofilament, braided and fluorocarbon.
Bait is needed to attract the fish. There are many different types of bait–both artificial and natural. Artificial baits mimic the natural food sources of fish. When you go fishing, you will need hooks to catch the fish once it bites your bait. Hooks are normally included in artificial baits, while the angler usually applies the natural bait to a hook. Hooks Bait is necessary.",0.9594880938529968,246,2.6147398948669434
"""Until we discover what it is to have peace with God, we're not going to discover the peace of God."" -Alistair Begg
The human heart craves peace. Some look for peace through possessions. Others find peace in a pill. But true inner-peace comes through the person of Jesus Christ.

"Every time I travel, something is surprising and different about the place that I wasn’t anticipating. The biggest surprise for me on this trip was all of the smoking. The frequency, the amount, and the demographic who partake in the activity are really astounding. I start with this to then pivot and address the sustainability initiatives going on in Greece at present. It seems that, in my opinion, the citizens of Greece are more interested in the sustainability of the city around them, than they are in their own physical health! In terms of the supply chain, I believe it begins with what you put into your body before it can have an effect on the world around you. The traditional linear supply chain is now being phased out due to research about the environmental effects it leads. This traditional linear chain takes natural resources, turns them into a good or product, and then gets discarded. Similar to 99% of everything produced goes to waste just six months later. It’s terrible. It’s surprising to me that the closed-loop supply chain hasn’t gained traction sooner, as there is money to be made from the more sustainable practices. I guess that since it requires more work, and doesn’t play into the American ‘get rich quick’ query, it hasn’t been able to make an impact until something detrimental were to come of it, ie global warming, waste, pollution levels, etc. I think as time has gone on, many consumers are changing their attitudes in terms of consumption and realizing that there is no need to have excess things. Having said this, it makes for the perfect opportunity to purge the things we don’t need, in a sustainable way, to begin and help maintain a closed-loop supply chain. In a perfect world, closed-loop supply chains would be the only kind we know. This way, nothing would really go to waste, and everything would be used to create something else, therefore increasing the longevity of the smallest things. Closed-loop supply chains are very tough to achieve as there are only certifications out for companies, not individuals. These companies that are producing the goods and services that we buy are the ones responsible for overconsumption and pollution, as individuals are astronomically smaller comparatively. The change will come faster and more direct if it comes from the top. We as consumers and individuals can facilitate this through our consumer attitudes.",0.9754161834716797,488,1.929363489151001
"Ask me this 5, or even 3, years ago, and I would've spouted on about the big ""C"" word, and the importance of raising funds for diabetes research. 2 years ago my focus was almost solely on advocacy. Today, to be honest, it's a mixed bag, but overall, I'm focused on the now.
While I understand that a cure is not in the immediate future, I so still believe with all of my heart that there is one out there, and that the number one barrier to discovering it is money. As a parent of a child with type 1, I can't stop believing in a cure because it's the ultimate goal, the holy grail so to speak. But do I actively seek a cure and tirelessly fund-raise for it? No, not anymore.
And I certainly understand the critical importance and role of advocacy. There are simply too many people who do not receive, or cannot afford, even the most basic of diabetes care, such as insulin and test strips. There are too many children who do not receive government funded insulin pumps, and there are far too many people suffering the side effects of type 1 diabetes, such as blindness, neuropathy, and kidney problems. Type 1 diabetes is a cripplingly expensive disease and we cannot simply sit back while others struggle. We have the opportunity to be not only a voice, but a gateway between those with information, and those without.
Today, I'm focused on the now. On the present and nothing more. I'm purposefully letting go of the past, and not worrying about the future. I have wasted far too much time and energy stressing over yesterday, and obsessing over a tomorrow that is beyond my control. The present is where I live, and I'm taking care of myself and my family as best I possibly can. I am learning and growing constantly, and teaching my children to do the same. In terms of diabetes, we are focused on day to day care: regular testing, carb counting, daily exercise, consistent sleep patterns. Tomorrow'a A1c, or future complication risk, is not dictated by what we do in the future, it is based on what we do today, and everyday, one day at a time.",0.9749405384063721,456,1.1646078824996948

"Over the past couple of years, Wiltshire has attracted front page attention around the world due to the Novichok attacks that took place in 2018.
It’s not a county that regularly draws the attention of the world’s press, but it has been building an impressive reputation as one of the UK’s 5 best places to do business.
Bounded by Swindon to the north, and Salisbury to the south, Wiltshire occupies an enviable location in the south west. Whether you’re commuting to London, travelling from Heathrow, linking up with clients in Bristol, or visiting offices in Cardiff the transport connections are great. There’s currently 38,000 businesses that have chosen to locate in this beautiful county. Between them they generate a sizeable £18 billion.
Demand for Business Storage in Wiltshire is High
It comes as no surprise, therefore, that demand for business storage in Wiltshire is growing in excess of the national average. Whether it’s companies moving office, corporate headquarters undergoing refurbishment, or start ups using storage as a cost-effective stock room, Wiltshire businesses are finding creative ways to take advantage of local storage solutions.
As demand grows, so do the storage facilities. With so many now to choose from, how can businesses be sure that they’re choosing the right solution for their requirements? We’ve put together 5 checks we recommend businesses carry out before making their decision:
Is the Location Local?
Whatever your reason for needing business storage, local facilities make sense. Ideally, you should be able to access your storage container quickly and simply throughout business hours. It’s a good idea to check out any storage facilities you’re considering before making your decision. Is there a well-maintained car park? Is there bright lighting for winter afternoons? Does it feel secure?
Get a Generously Sized Container
Your storage container isn’t a box, it’s a room full of things you’re likely to want to access quickly and easily. Don’t be tempted to skimp on space and make do with a tightly packed storage unit. You’ll only waste time taking everything out in order to try and find something that will inevitably be lurking at the bottom.
What’s the Security Like?
Don’t take anyone’s word when it comes to security; check out the facility first hand. You’ll want to know that entry to the site is secured by access control, that 24 hour CCTV is installed throughout, and that access to all containers is ‘client-only’. You should be offered a unique password, or key code to access your unit, and feel assured that security really is a priority across the site.
Professional storage management includes environmental monitoring and high standards of cleanliness, fire protection and pest control. You’ll know from a visit to a storage facility whether it feels well maintained. There should also be policies covering each of the environmental standards. Get this wrong and you could find that your goods gradually deteriorate because of the storage conditions.
You’re looking for professionals to take care of your goods. Don’t be afraid to ask lots of questions, and if you don’t get satisfactory answers, you know to look elsewhere. Most important, you need to feel that these people would ‘go the extra mile’ should there be a problem. If they seem disengaged, uninterested, or abrupt you probably shouldn’t trust your business storage with them.",0.94208163022995,744,1.115038275718689

"How else are they going to fight back when the jackbooted thugs come to take their liberties away?
In all seriousness, that’s the literal reason the Second Amendment was added to the Constitution. That makes it a fundamental principle of the American political system: the people have a right to stockpile weapons in preparation for an armed uprising.
Well, I’ve been reading English for quite a few years now, but I can’t figure out what that sentence is supposed to mean. In any event, the supreme court says it’s fine for the federal and state governments to limit gun ownership.
An maybe if you don’t have people collecting guns in anticipation of an armed uprising, there wouldn’t be much of a risk of an armed uprising.
That’s not actually a serious answer at all. I sincerely doubt there are many people who buy guns to engage in an armed uprising.
If you look at the way guns are marketed and advertised, it’ll give you a pretty clear insight into why people buy them:
Because they hunt. A very large number of guns are bought for hunting purposes.
Because they are afraid of criminals and feel guns will protect them.
Because they think guns are cool and they will be better people for having them.
If you don’t believe #3, google “Bushmaster Ad Man Card.” Of course, wanting a thing because you think it makes you better is hardly unique to guns. It’s a common marketing technique for many things.
#1 is just what you expect in a country where there’s lots of hunting, and #3 is a cultural matter. #2, of course, is a prisoner’s dilemma; the more people who have guns, the more gun violence you have, and the more people will want guns. When a maniac shoots up a workplace people might want more gun control, but that is an abstract thing that they cannot directly cause to happen. What they CAN do is get a gun in the hopes they can use it on bad guys. Which, statistically, results in at least one such person pulling the gun on someone in a heated argument and blowing them away, which means more gun violence stories, and more fear of gun-armed assailants, and more guns.
Or Google just about any of our popular heroes (not necessarily American), like James Bond or the heroes of Star Wars. Very often they’re shown wielding a weapon. Why? Apparently because a person holding a weapon is more interesting, more potent, more badass than a person who isn’t holding a weapon.
It’s not that you want to kill people; it’s just that you don’t want anybody to kill you, or kick you around or mess with you. Nobody messes with a man holding a gun. (At least, that’s the way it works in many people’s imaginations, as opposed to real life.)
I know it originates with the Third Reich’s naming of the Sturmgewehr, but isn’t “assault weapon” a bit of a nebulous term that can revolve around aesthetics? If all you do with your Bushmaster is plink precious antique cans, is it an “assault” weapon? You’re not assaulting anyone.
No they don’t want to kill people.
A 2011 Gallup poll showed that 46% of men and 23% of women claim to personally own a firearm. If we take that number as true (it’s actually probably a higher number since many gun owners do not like to advertise their gun ownership). So if we take the total number of adults in the united states, 240 million, and divide that by 2 to represent the group of men and women we get (120m * .46)+(120m * .23) = 82.8 million gun owners in the United States.
So if only 10% of gun owners actually wanted to kill people the slaughter would be horrific. If each only killed one person (a low estimate to be sure) there would be more deaths, 8.28 million, than all of wounded and killed members of the military in the history of the country (1,354,664 dead and 1,498,237 wounded).
So I think it is safe to say that gun owners don’t just want to kill people.
I question your source for the owner being more likely to kill himself than others especially if you don’t count suicide.
There is no such thing as a “assault weapon” nor does calling them assault weapons mean that they are inherently used for attack rather than defense.
I assume your fourth statement has to do with the idea that people on the “no-fly list” should be prevented from owning guns. This idea runs contrary to the idea of due process of law. A person is put on the list without any evidence being presented against them, and being given no chance to defend themselves prior to being put on the list. Furthermore the person is not informed that they are on the list until they attempt to fly. Couple that with the fact that the no-fly list is full of known errors. The no fly list in and of itself is a constitutional nightmare and is only justified because flying is supposedly a privilege rather than a right.
Now start using that list to decide who can own a gun? How about we use the list to decide who can be a member of the press? or who can have freedom of religion? Or who can vote?
I’m not an expert, but I’m pretty sure there are no guns that stop bullets, only ones that spit out bullets. Strangely, you don’t see millions of people buying bullet-proof vests…
A bad thing, to be sure.
However, the point is that if it’s ok (for some interpretation of “ok”) for the relatively harmless act of flying, why is it suddenly inconceivable to use the same system to keep instrument of death out of people’s hands?
Either the process is flawed and the no-fly list needs to go or improved, or the process is acceptable and then it should be used to make it harder for dangerous people to get their hands on dangerous stuff.
It’s scary to think that some people consider the “right” to buy weapons more important than the right to travel.
You might want to check out the thread in IMHO on the Second Amendment, it may prove elucidating.
The long and short of it is that, in the United States at least, the founders (and a great many others since) believed that you have an innate right to possess arms, the Constitution doesn’t give you that right, it simply says that it cannot be infringed by law. An equivalent can’t be drawn to the ‘right’ to get on a plane.
Well even though your OP seems purposely disingenuous, at the risk of stating the obvious: guns are tools for killing animals. I am sure there are far more non-human animals killed by guns each year than people. Statistically speaking.
America is a frontier culture. Even if modern life and a few hundred years of exploration and colonization have kind of made that lifestyle obsolete for most, especially urban city-dwellers, if you actually want to attempt to understand gun culture then you need to understand this fundamental aspect of it.
I don’t think guns are cool nor exciting in any way, but they are pretty little pieces of brilliantly designed machinery. And they can be useful in a host of situations.
However, rather than worrying about it, consider:
a/ The more Americans are killed by other Americans, the fewer remain for the rest of us to have to kill.
b/ The more Americans are killed by other Americans, the fewer there are to kill the rest of us.
See the problem isn’t can we improve the no-fly list but rather why in the world do we have the list in the first place? I agree that freedom of travel by our preferred methods should be a right. You shouldn’t have to walk from Honolulu to Washington DC in order to petition your government. If a no-fly list must exists it should require a judge in open court putting you on that list in accordance with the 5th and 14th amendments.
The right to travel freely however is not a enumerated right, on the other hand the right to keep and bear arms is. Should not the enumerated, fundamental rights be protected most vigilantly and to the most strict standards? The reason that they were enumerated was precisely because they were viewed the most likely to be infringed upon by tyrants and the most likely rights to prevent tyrants from taking power. If we fail to defend them how is it possible to defend the rest.",0.9678341150283813,1858,2.128613233566284

"No house is perfect. Even the most carefully maintained property will have a small number of imperfections. Almost certainly, you could make an impromptu list of the things you know should be repaired in the property in which you currently live.
The same is true of the property you are proposing to purchase. There are bound to be maintenance items and small defects present that can be dealt with by routine, minor repairs.
However, many people, upon commissioning a building survey, find problems in the report that they had not anticipated having to deal with, over and above routine maintenance items that they were already aware of. The cost of such repairs can be dealt with prior to purchase by an agreement to lower the purchase price to take account of the necessary work that needs to be carried out.

Examples Of Saving Opportunities With A Building Surveyor
The term ‘defect’ can be of varying importance, depending on the homebuyer’s preference and requirements. Regardless of how small a defect may be, building surveyors will advise for corrections to avoid further problems further down the line. Defects such as small cracks in rooms that may not be used very often, for example, can then become leaks during certain weather conditions, creating further costs.
Uncovering Hidden Costs
Building surveyors have a keen and well-trained eye for potential hidden costs that may become apparent during certain circumstances. Discovering these issues as early as possible can be hugely beneficial and save on money in a number of ways. If found early enough by a building surveyor, the landlord of the property may be responsible for correcting said defects.
More Accurate Budgeting
Unexpected fees may completely undo plans put together by the homebuyer, for example, their budget planning for each room. Coming across issues throughout the property can lead to budget blocks for certain plans and can leave rooms looking less finished than others, whether it may be decoration, furniture or me. Building surveyors will be able to process correct payment from those responsible for the issues, ensuring homebuyer’s plans aren’t shattered.

"Ivan Radenkov has been a children’s writer since he became a father in 2012. His two sons inspired him to write, and they make him live his second childhood every day, as they make mischief and create stories together. Each of their adventures is an inspiration for new stories with pictures and sometimes music. Because Ivan is also a musician, we often read lyrics in his other books, and in the enclosed CDs we hear music with guitars and drums, which the children like.

I know that a lot of small businesses are interested in social media marketing to grow their business. I speak with thousands of small business owners a year (probably just like you) who hear about social media but don’t know exactly how they can get value from social media.
I have worked with many of these business owners to help them find success in social media, and I know that small businesses can get results using social media marketing. I know first hand that social media can provide a better ROI than traditional marketing methods. Social Media marketing can deliver results when used strategically and with the right plan.
Here are 10 of the most common ways that small businesses can use social media to grow their business. In no particular order, here are 10 ways that small businesses can use social media:
Twitter is a powerful way to share deals and promotions with your customers (and future customers)! Big companies like Dell Outlet have sold millions of dollars through twitter, but it works for small companies too. Naked Pizza, a small pizza store in New Orleans had their highest ever sales day from a twitter promotion. Vista Prints sold $25,000 directly through twitter in their first year. Find and connect with your target audience and give them irresistable offers on Twitter.
Don’t have a fan page yet? If you have fans or customers who are passionate about your business you should have a fan page. Use it to connect with customers and keep them up to date on your new products or services. I was recently getting my car fixed and found that the mechanic frequents the same neighborhood bar as I do. He told me that he checks out their Facebook page every day to see what food and drink specials they have. This bar has a creative new drink special for Happy Hour every day and a different free food item available.
Whether is it food and drink specials, new items in your store, new industry news or regulations a facebook fan page can be a powerful resource to keep your customers up to date. Over 1/3 of people who are fans of companies on Facebook are fans for this reason – to stay up to date.
Lots of small businesses and professionals grow their businesses by networking with people. Meeting people and sharing helpful knowledge drives business over time. People do business with people they know, like and trust.
LinkedIn groups allow you connect with others based on a shared interest. You can join a group and contribute to discussions or share interesting news. By using LinkedIn to build relationships you can earn new customers over time.
Webinars are becoming increasingly popular ways to connect with prospects adn provide value to customers. Webinars are virtual and web-based. A webinar is typically hosted around a specific topic and people sign up, call in and log-in on their computer and they can watch and listen to a live session on a specific topic.
Webinars are very popular in categories that are high-information. Most B-to-B business fall in to this categoy, but it also works for consumer products. If people are looking for knowledge or information on your subject area, a webinar can be a powerful tool to share information with them and position yourself as a leader.
Blogs are very popular for a variety of reasons (we’ll discuss one more of them later in this post). One of the reasons is that a blog can establish you as an expert and thought leader in your industry. If people trust you and see you as knowledgeable they are more likely to do business with you.
Run a gym? Share workout tips. Real Estate Agent? Share posts highlighting the people and events in your neighborhood. Restaurant? Show how you make signature drinks or menu items.
So maybe *technically* this isn’t social media, but it is relatively simple and cheap for most businesses to create a newsletter. Constant Contact and MailChimp offer services for under $25 a month and are easy to use.
An email newsletter can keep your customers and prospects up to speed on news, deals and promotions. Email remains the preferred communication method of most people (1:10 preference over social media) to stay up to date.
There are online communities for almost everything these days. Seek out a discussion forum or community that is specific to your business and participate!
You can connect with customers (or potential customers) and really learn about them. What are they interested in? What do they talk about? What do they want and need in products? Participating and listening to communinities that are comprised of your business target can improve your product but also lead to sales as you build relationships.
There are many business review sites – from product reviews on amazon to restaurant and store reviews on yelp to complaints on The Ripoff Report. Whatever your business line, chances are there are review sites that are relevant. Even Facebook has included reviews on fan pages. Google has reviews in their listings.
Look for and respond to reviews (both good and bad). Saying thanks to a good review can build an evangelist and encourage word-of-mouth. Responding to a negative review can help clarify the situation. Showing that you care about negative reviews and plan to take action shows your side of the situation to the hundreds of people who view the review.
Another great reason to start a blog is to get traffic from search engines. Because blogs are content rich (you typically create content for them on a regular basis) search engines give traffic to sites with blogs.
In almost anything that you search for you’ll find a number of blogs show up in search results. If people find you business through search a blog can increase the probability that you will show up in results. This leads to traffic and (hopefully) sales.
Videos can be great ways to connect with your audience. A picture is worth a thousand words and a video is worth a million! Video is a great way to share information – whether it is a video showing how you make a dish, customers talking about their satisfaction or a video demo of your product – videos are powerful tools.
Create a video for your business to make a deeper connection with your audience. Whatever your business there are many different creative ways to use and share videos.
This list isn’t exhaustive – it is simply a handful of the tactics and tools that are included in the Social Media Action Pack.

"Ever wonder how to watch free movies on the pc? Most people have. Motion pictures are rarely our initially alternative for activity, nevertheless we are able to usually uncover an element that we loved. It’s often to watch stand up comedy or dramas, even though when we do as a final point decide to head out to the screen. There is no doubt, nevertheless, that this really is the most effective operate we can do though continue to near the pc.
Why is that? The very fact movie, is and television primarily driven by plot of land. If there’s a struggle or simply a puzzle available, a character is either solving the challenge or finding a pay off at the conclusion. Television shows, movies, and comic strips give a lot of time to creating and building plots and people. Characters may well switch, nevertheless these character types and their fights include the motive people today check out the exhibit. Plot could be the spirit and coronary heart of what causes us to satisfied or miserable.
Now check out several of the best motion pictures historical. The last of these I’ll mention these days isn’t a Ordinary Family. I believe, this picture is amongst the greatest comedy motion pictures previously aimed. Forget about the rest of the science fiction dreams and thrillers that came ahead of it. This is real enjoyment and guided by the one and only Clint Eastwood.
No Ordinary Parents are directed by Blake Edwards, and superstars Steve Martin, Christopher Walken, and Robert DeNiro. It had become unveiled in 1980, pursuing the discharge of Rosemary Clooney’s Animal House. The show itself employs a couple (including Martin and Walken) since they handle troubles on its way involving their and them children. Although the appearing is excellent throughout, the best durability of your narrative comes from home Blake Edwards. His route and cinematography are both excellent with out Ordinary Folks are conveniently the most beneficial photograph he previously aimed.
An execllent warAnddread hybrid car film is A Few Good Men. In my view this is without a doubt the most effective flick on the several years, as well as the last of popular movie director for example Clint Eastwood. The storyplot adheres to a warfare seasoned (Eastwood), who results you will find Vietnam to do business with uncle, an ex boyfriend-boatman (Keaton Weeks) right after the struggle. In order to survive.
One of the most emotive movies of year, The Evening Prior to a Fall is really a gorgeous illustration in the awful connection between war, though dealing with the ex, he finishes up in a ugly situation, exactly where he has to destroy a number of regional joe public and representatives. The delayed David Fincher gives one of the more terrific actions of his vocation, because he represents the role on the U.S. jewellry, in whose the world is converted when a kerbside explosive device kills his wife and boy or girl. Even though late Jack Nicholson bakes an great flick kind of this from the after updates of his Chicago trilogy, it’s no less important for its regular meaning of warfare and great loss.
Probably the greatest motion pictures of year, Finding Nemo comes after the life of an clownfish branded Marlin, who sooner or later turns into associated with a modern gang of bass friends currently in an aquarium tank. Marlin also builds up a passion affinity for a person’s woman’s branded Dory, performed by Ellen DeGeneres. It was actually actually can be a TV series, instead of full-period element video.
Other videos in the 2021 twelve months which can be considered among the finest of the season include Skipper Phillips, Mad Center, along with the Key Life span of Bees,. That must be many people is not going to inform you of this picture. Of them 3 videos, The Key Time of Bees is recognised as more of a minuscule-operatic comedy, whilst Captain Phillips is thinking about being a dimly lit, strong activityAndadventure flick by using a fantastic clothing thrown. Whichever of them time tested motion pictures you enjoy, you will quit disappointed in what is now being presented in 2010 by way of the flicks and filmmakers of Hollywood.

"Alarming Projections for Global CO2 Emissions
The international community confronts an immense challenge in addressing climate change as projections indicate that this year will witness an all-time high in global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
The Urgent Call for Drastic Carbon Reduction
Scientists assert that carbon pollution must be reduced by nearly half this decade to meet the Paris Agreement’s objective of limiting global warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels.
Disconcerting Shift in CO2 Trends
Preliminary data suggest that CO2 levels, which experts anticipated to decrease by around five percent this year, now project an increase of up to one and a half percent.
Expert Insights and Warnings
According to AFP, Glen Peters, the scientist leading the research, remarked, “A reduction in emissions by 2023 is highly improbable.”
Current predictions predict a 0.5–1.5 percent increase in CO2 emissions from cars, planes, electricity, heating, and food production.
Peters, who serves as the research director at the CICERO climate research institute in Norway, pointed out, “As emissions persist in rising, achieving pathways compliant with the Paris Agreement becomes progressively more challenging.”
He will publish his final report in December before a crucial UN climate summit in the UAE with world leaders.
The agenda will focus on fossil fuel use, a major cause of CO2 pollution.
However, there is not all bad news.
Hope Amidst Challenges: Transition to Cleaner Energy
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has predicted that global demand for oil, gas, and coal will peak in this decade. The IEA previously forecasted this year that the ‘remarkable’ growth of electric vehicles and cleaner energy technologies will contribute to this.
Nevertheless, the energy watchdog cautioned that “persistently high emissions” during the economic recovery following the pandemic and the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pose obstacles to addressing global warming.
Peters noted that the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy should already be underway, but he added, “This is regrettably not occurring in any substantial manner at present.”
There were expectations that the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions would be reached in 2015, followed by the Covid-19 pandemic.
However, both projections failed to materialize, as carbon dioxide levels continued to increase with no signs of abating.
Prominent scientists have also warned that exceeding 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels in global temperatures could potentially trigger a hazardous turning point in the climate system.
Peters remarked, “Yet, here we are once more, with a new peak anticipated in 2022 and yet another peak expected in 2023.”
“My concern is that we are only transitioning away from fossil fuels and doing only half the job by increasing clean energy production.”
According to the IEA, CO2 emissions reached an all-time high of 36.8 billion tonnes in 2022, an increase of 321 million tonnes, or 0.9%.",0.9432507157325745,655,3.1509034633636475

"Take a look at how I can bring clarity, focus and confidence to the growth of your business
Let’s focus on you
Running a business can feel like your brain is running at top speed all hours of the day. With new ideas going round in your head constantly, it can be difficult to organise your thoughts into a clear plan that you can execute.
As your business mentor, it’s my job to bring clarity to your goals, find the space to focus on your priorities, and help you make decisions with confidence.
I’ll offer the support, and sometimes the challenge when you need it, to help guide you to your solutions. As we work together, I’ll get under the skin of your business, armed with an understanding of what you want and how you work, I’ll be there to help you face any challenges that crop up.
Your mentoring sessions are entirely led by you and your needs, with me to guide you and help keep us on track. I can help you connect the dots, and be your supportive sounding board to help you see the big picture clearly.
Big picture connections
Details are important, but if they don’t slot into a clear, big picture, how can you know if you’re on the right track? I can help you understand the interconnecting parts of your life, bringing an objective, friendly voice to help you piece everything together.
A challenging viewpoint
Sometimes, getting you to think about your life and business can mean asking difficult questions, and really getting to the heart of what’s holding you back. Together, we’ll address any difficult situations if they arise, and I’ll be there to help challenge and reflect back on what I’m hearing so that you can see the reality.
Achievement through action
I always love seeing that lightbulb moment in my clients. The moment where everything clicks into place, and you know what you want to achieve. By working through your challenges together, we’ll find the best course of action for you to take, with you at the helm.
How it all works
The steps to creating a successful business mentor relationship
Through a free, 30 minute introductory session, you can tell me exactly where you are in your business journey, and what you want to get out of your mentoring sessions. These sessions are great for finding out if we ‘click’, and if we both want to work together.
Before your first session, I’ll send over some resources to help you start thinking about your goals, objectives, and any current challenges you might be facing. This also helps us to get the most out of our sessions, where I can use your reflections to drive our time together. We will also formally contract at this stage.
We’ll work together for 6 sessions. Each of these:
- Is 1.5 hours long.
- Can take place face to face or over zoom.
- Usually happens once a month but can be tailored to fit your schedule
After each meeting, I’ll send over my notes, and anything we can reflect on before our next session, and might even include some action points.
Outside of our sessions, I’ll be available over the phone or by email whenever you need that extra dose of perspective, advice, or even just to update me on your progress.
After your 6th session, we’ll review what we’ve covered so far, and reflect on the goals and objectives we’ve discussed. If you feel it would be beneficial for you, we can also look at recontracting for as long as you need me.
Your investment in your success
Mentoring has the potential to transform your life and your business, which is why it requires financial investment, as well as investment of your time, energy and creativity.
- Total investment of £1,200 for 6 sessions.
- £120 deposit made payable once we’ve agreed to work together.
- Followed by 6 payments of £180, invoiced after each session.
- Or £250 for a one-off session
- 90 minutes to help you get unstuck, and move your business forward.
- Perfect for anyone looking for a one-off meeting to bounce ideas around together, or to find support in making a big decision without the longer-term commitment.
If you’re based outside of the Leeds area but would still prefer a face to face session, my travel and accommodation costs will also be included in your invoice, as long as you agree to this beforehand.

"(Seattle, WA) March 6, 2014- Washington Brewers Guild will present its annual Washington Cask Beer Festival at the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall on Saturday, March 22. This year’s event will mark its 15th year and it will feature more than 100 cask-conditioned beers by 41 Guild member breweries, the biggest lineup the event has ever had.
Cask Festival is often considered one of the favorite beer events among craft beer aficionados and brewers alike. In addition to the fact that they simply love cask-conditioned beer and there will be more than 100 of them to choose from, its wildly unique beer lineup that consists mainly of one-off and limited releases is also a big draw. Most beers are brewed in small batches and the brewers get to flex their creative muscles by experimenting with different hops, aging in barrels, and using unusual ingredients such as smoked black peppers, orange marmalade and rose petals.
Below are some of the beers that can be found at this year’s Cask Festival:
Hops, hops and more hops With more than 30 IPA’s, Double IPA’s and Imperial IPA’s there will be no shortage of hoppy beer at the Cask Festival Try classic IPA’s including Big Time Bhagwan’s Best IPA and Anacortes IPA, and Imperial and dry-hopped versions such as Boundary Bay Imperial IPA and Schooner Exact Evergreen IPA.
IPA’s with twists For those who love hops but are looking for something different- Elliott Bay Brewing’s Lake City anniversary beer is a Black IPA while 7 Seas Brewing’s Depth Finder India Red Ale is a cross between IPA and Amber. Also try American Brewing’s Revolutionary RyePA and Issaquah Brewhouse’s Contraband IPL, a lager version of their house IPA.
Traditionalists Many brewers are paying homage to the traditional beer styles from England, home of “real ales”. Machine House Brewery, Hi-Fi Brewing and Georgetown Brewing (2nd session only) will all bring their version of English Mild while Maritime Pacific Brewing, Big Al Brewing and Redhook Brewery opted for ESB’s.
(Barrel) aged gracefully Aging is a beautiful thing when it comes to beer, especially when it takes place in a barrel. Naked City Brewery’s Sour beer and Hale’s Ales’ Imperial Stout were aged in bourbon barrels while Fremont Brewing (Dark Star Stout) and Bainbridge Island Brewing (Russian Imperial Stout) aged their beers in whiskey barrels.
People’s Choice Winners Last year’s People Choice winners Silver City Brewery’s Bourbon Barrel Fat Scotch and Diamond Knot Brewing’s Apple-Cinnamon ESB (1st session and 2nd session, respectively) are both returning to the event this year (Bourbon Barrel Fat Scotch available during the 1st session only). Will they be able to defend their titles?",0.9381590485572815,621,0.7820566296577454

"Naptown’s own Skypp recently dropped his latest full-length, a 12-track project in Tenth. The project has no features, but does have production from Zero, SoulCineMatik, Sincere, Mondo Geezy and others. I’ve also added videos that Skypp released for both “Hidden Treasure” and “Uhaul” from the project. Stream via Spotify.
Click here to purchase.
“TENTH was written to put a positive light on our negative upbringings. I grew up on the near east side of town; 10th Street. There’s a lot of negative things you can take away from that sort of upbringing but somehow, I managed to take away a lot of positive. They may not have been delivered to me in the purest form, but it’s not about what you see; it’s about how you perceive it. TENTH is an album full of those experiences; delivered in a way so a person who’s never been through these things can relate.
The album cover is a depiction of what TENTH instilled in my head. Hence, the street signs poking out, and the gold blood dripping. The blood represents the knowledge. Knowledge is one of the most valuable things. In the backdrop is my neighborhood; 10th Street. At the very bottom of the album cover is a quote that says: “What the neighborhood taught me…”
What I’m speaking of are the characteristics you see on the street signs: loyalty, integrity, sacrifice & sophistication. I’d like to thank God for the drive & will to continue bringing my vision to life time after time. I’d like to thank Warren ‘Three V’ Harris & Shadowkat Nightson for their hard work, support, dedication and just believing in this album as much as I do. Uncle Jamz for his incomparable support and guidance throughout the past six years.
Zero, SoulCineMatik, Sincere, Mondo Geezy, One & Walt for their dope production. Without them, this album wouldn’t be half as dope. S. Colli & Al J Hayes for their photography services. Patrick ‘GeekGod’ Bell for the amazing graphic designs. And, all of YOU for your unwavering support!” – Skypp",0.9646309018135071,498,1.0374412536621094

"Wedding season is getting into swing, so each week we're going to give you a detailed look at all of the bridal fabrics, embellishments and know-how that Britex has to offer–from the firsthand perspectives of our experts on the floor. This week, we're speaking with Laura at the third floor bridal counter, who has a decade of experience in making brides and wedding parties as beautiful as they can be.
Q: Tell us a little about the Britex bridal counter. A: Well, we have an extensive range of pretty much everything a bride or her bridal party might need in order to make their attire memorable and unique. There are so many choices it can get a little overwhelming–most brides are looking for white or ivory, and it's amazing the range of shades and tones within those two colors. So it can be tricky to find a trim for each bride's gown, but we can pretty much do it. A lot of my day is spent just separating the white from the ivory–it's a really important distinction when you're trying to put your hand as quickly as possible on a particular trim. Whites range from a blue white to a pale, pale almost-ivory, maybe even with pale pink touches. Ivory can run anywhere from a light toffee tone or champagne to almost white, but all ivories tend to be warmer tones.
Q: In addition to bridal trims, what other kinds of accessories do you stock? A: We have pre-made veils in single tiers, two tiers and circle-cut to accommodate brides who might want anything from a simple single tier to a short blusher to a long veil with a blusher (a blusher is that lovely layer that goes in front of the face for the big reveal). Some brides choose to wear the blusher in the back because they want more volume. Alternatively, we carry an assortment of really beautiful tiaras, combs, and headbands with crystals and pearls. Some are really simple and some are intricate and ornate. We like to give the tiaras names–one of the most impressive styles is the ""Czarina."" In terms of colored trim, we have gorgeous golds, very beautiful silvers, metallics, crystal trims with gold and silver and even rose gold settings, plus an extensive range of venise, chantilly and alencon edges for veils. Most brides either want something to match their gowns–which are frequently already trimmed in lace, so we need to find something complementary–or to create an additional element on a sleek, simple gown.
Q: What are some of the new trends you've been seeing? A: Venise lace has been much more popular recently, and we've gotten a lot of new shapes, colors and patterns. It's a very useful and beautiful type of lace: most people recognize it for its ability to be cut apart easily to make new shapes and appliques. For the bridal party, mother-of-the-bride, or bride who wants to experiment with color in her own dress, we have a lot of beautiful beaded laces and trims that can pick up all of the shades in a bridal palette, and accent and complement virtually any fabric. Right now, we're seeing a lot of demand for taupe, rose gold, grey and silver. And of course there's always someone who needs a chartreuse or a vivid pink, and we've got that too. We can do both elegant and eclectic.
Q: What is your favorite thing at the counter right now? A: I am so excited about some of the new alençons that we've been able to acquire with leafy patterns. The detail is incredible. They're French…and it's solely due to our European contacts that we're able to get things like that.
Q: How about a memorable bride? A: Oh, boy. There are a lot. One bride recently wanted to incorporate black into her gown, and that can be especially challenging if you don't want it to come off as costume-y. she came in three different times at various stage of putting together the gown. The first time she left in tears because things weren't going the way she imagined; she needed some time to really assimilate all of the options to figure out what she was going to be able to do and talk with her seamstress. The second time we tried more things and found something perfect: beautiful and romantic, and occasion-worthy for bridal. The third time, she came in to show me pictures of the wedding. The gown was lovely and she was lovely in it–and so happy! In the end, that's really what we're here for.",0.9669468402862549,983,0.9684674739837646

What is an A-level?
Advanced Levels or A-Levels are subject-based qualifications that British students aged 16 or older must get if they plan to enter university or just want to gain better knowledge in a particular study area or professionthey are into. A-levels are studied across two years: your AS year (Year 12) and your A2 year (Year 13).
- Study four subjects in their AS year.
- Drop one, which they achieve an AS-level in.
- Continue with the other three in their A2 year to achieve full A-levels in these.
What A-level subjects can you study?
There are around 80 different subjects available to study at A-level. However, the options available to you will depend on which your school or college offers.
Typical A-level subjects include:
- Ones you’ve studied before: history, music, chemistry etc.
- Variations on ones you’ve studied before: eg you could choose between English literature, English language, or English literature and language; or you could take maths and further maths.
- Subjects you’ve never had the chance to study before: eg law, philosophy, psychology etc.
English, maths and sometimes science are the important subjects to get this in – not just when applying to A-levels, but to university and jobs too – as well as any subjects you plan to study at A-level.
Do A levels expire?
No, they don’t.
What Advantages Can A-Level Maths Offer You?
Having A-level maths can open up a world of opportunities in the working world. In fact, A-level maths makes you more desirable as an employee.

Numbers, problem solving and equations are actually used in both home and working life. Popular career choices for those with A-level maths include engineering, computing, accountancy, economics, banking, business, retail management, surveying, psychology, air traffic control, architecture, cartography, psychology and teaching.
What Advantages Will A-level ICT Offer You?
There can be few jobs these days where the use and/or application of ICT is not important. Subsequently, people with proven ICT skills, such as an A-level in ICT qualification, are much in demand by employers locally, nationally and internationally. As report writing is important in an ICT environment — a good standard of literacy will be required too.
What Advantages Will A-level English Language and Literature Offer You?
Studying A-level English Language and Literature gives you the opportunity to improve and extend your knowledge and understanding of English literature and language development, so that you might more fully enjoy it. A-level English Language and Literature is an ideal preparation for those intending to study English further and is, of course, of great relevance to careers in many industries and businesses.
What Advantages Can A-Level Physics Offer You?
Having A-level physics offers you access to a huge range of options for both further education and careers. A-level physics is a highly respected form of qualification that can open doors to a number of possibilities. Possible career options with A-level physics include food scientist, climatologist, radiographer, ergonomics expert, medical physicist, geophysicist, chemist, oceanography, naval architect, audio technician and orthoptist, to name but a few.
There are a huge range of careers where A-level physics is highly desirable, not to mention the engineering possibilities, such as flight, design, mining, medical, electrical/electronic, mechanical, aeronautical and agricultural.
What Advantages Will A-level German Offer You?
Apart from studying A-level German to then go on to university to study German or another modern language to a higher level, simply having an A-level in German could be very useful in any number of careers. With the German economy being such a powerhouse of the European economy – many companies will welcome recruits who can communicate in German fluently.
Also, if you simply enjoy visiting Germany or have regular contact with German friends – then studying A-level German will undoubtedly enhance your experiences and enjoyment.
What Advantages Will A-level Spanish Offer You?
Having the qualification A-level Spanish will be of great benefit for anyone seeking work in Spain, work as a Spanish translator or, indeed, anyone hoping to study Spanish or other European languages in higher education. Students of A-level Travel and Tourism might also consider taking this A-level. Needless to say, of course, if you simply enjoy visiting Spain, then having the ability and confidence to read, write and speak well in Spanish — can only enhance your enjoyment of being in Spain.

"There once lived a Greek poet by the name of Archilochus, among whose surviving fragments is the following, which I regularly inflict each semester upon great numbers of unsuspecting students:
The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.
Knowing next to nothing about either animal, they wonder if I’m making a zoological point, which of course I’m not. It’s a metaphor, I tell them, designed to make a precise and deeply theological point. How so? Because the one big thing he knows may provide the student of Catholic theology an almost perfect point of entry into the mysteries of faith.
Allow me to explain. While I’ve seen a few foxes out and about, only once in my life have I seen a hedgehog, and from the safety of my car I very nearly ran him over. Nevertheless, my sympathies are entirely on the side of the hedgehog, whose single-minded perspective enables him to see into the very heart of faith, there to espy the one mystery without which everything remains mystery.",0.9576796889305115,223,1.8367778062820435
"Edmonton charities call on Albertans for help amid Canada Post strike – Edmonton | Globalnews.ca
As many Albertans find alternative solutions to get their holiday mail shipped due to the Canada Post strike, some Edmonton charities hope people don’t forget about them as they believe this job action could impact many people in need.
Earlier this week, the Hope Mission sent a notice urging Albertans to donate online or by phone to ensure their contributions reach those in need during the labour disruptions.
“It could delay those donations at a time of year when people are looking for hope the most. It is a very lonely time for a lot of our vulnerable neighbours,” Hope Mission donor relations manager Kevin Wiebe said.
“Many of them don’t have family. So, at a time when many of us are gathering with our families and the Christmas season, then our vulnerable neighbours are in need of that kind of hope.”
The organization says its services are at an all-time high. The last two months of the year are critical for funding holiday meals, winter shelters and other programs.
Last year, the charity was serving roughly 1,800 meals per day. As of this past Wednesday, Wiebe says it is preparing more than 2,500 hot meals.
Meanwhile, 880 CHED Santas Anonymous delivers donated toys to more than 20,000 children per year.
Executive director Angel Benedict says about 30 per cent of its million-dollar fundraising goal was raised by cheques received by mail.
“This is an important time where we normally would be sending out a beautiful letter out to families, talking about what’s coming up this year and why donations are so important,” Benedict said.
Get daily National news
Get the day’s top news, political, economic, and current affairs headlines, delivered to your inbox once a day.
“We’re really questioning whether that’s going to be a strategy that we can proceed with this year.”
Benedict says this will also impact tax season, as many mail-in donors may not be able to get their 2024 tax receipts for donations back in time.
“As we move further into December, that will become an increasing concern because that impacts their taxes so it does drive a lot of giving decisions,” she said.
While Benedict says she likes to give people multiple avenues to donate, she’s encouraging people to donate online.
Canada grapples with postal and port labour disputes
The Christmas Bureau of Edmonton says about 79 per cent of its donors give cheques and mail donations that run through Canada Post services.
Executive director Adam Zawadiuk says his donors feel more comfortable mailing in their contributions.
“Our hope is this is not a prolonged strike and people will still have that opportunity to get those donations in before Christmas,” Zawadiuk said.
The organization serves roughly 55,000 people with either a warm holiday meal or a gift card through its Holiday Food Hampers and Adopt-A-Teen programs.
“There’s a lot of organizations that are facing the same challenges as us. Even those organizations that aren’t seasonal, we know that at the end of the year, there is a huge fundraising campaign for everyone,” Zawadiuk said.
The Edmonton Food Bank says it recognizes an individual’s right to strike and supports postal workers. But the strike impacts them too.
Manager of strategic relations and partnerships Tamisan Bencz-Knight says the organization sends newsletters and 20,000 festive brown bags around this time of year to boost donation efforts.
“It allows us to get those bags into people’s hands. Because it’s a tangible thing that has a list of our most needed items. It has other ways to give,” Bencz-Knight said.
However, Bencz-Knight says the impact wouldn’t be as harsh since there are several other ways to contribute. She remains hopeful that Edmontonians will rally together.
Bencz-Knight encourages residents to donate non-perishable food items at grocery stores, fire halls or the Edmonton Food Bank warehouse, or make monetary donations.
“It might throw a wrench to all of our shopping plans and all of our solicitations. We’re just going to be a bit more creative at it,” she said.
“Edmontonians are great. Bar none, this is a hiccup. We will survive this because Edmontonians will help us through this.”

"Bee Balm - Spotted Beebalm Horsemint (Monarda punctata L) Spotted Bee Balm Bergamot Monarda Flowering Herb
Height: 6 in to 3 ft
Monarda punctata, is a herbaceous aromatice and erect perennial plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is commonly called spotted beebalm, spotted horsemint and horsemint. 'Monardas' are sometimes called horsemints because 'horse' signifies 'large' or 'coarse', as these members of this genus are generally larger, coarser plants than many other members of the mint family.
This native to the eastern U.S., Canada and Northeastern Mexico, Spotted Beebalm typically grows in dryish soils on prairies, sandy areas and coastal plains. The leaves and flowers and aerial portions are edible; long blooming (April to August) and drought tolerant - deer and rabbit resistant. Rosettes of flowers are usually yellow with maroon spotted markings on the upper petals, and may also be white or green. The bracts are showier and may be purple, pink, white or yellow; the tubular flowers occur in whorls, forming a dense, elongated spike at the end of the stem or from leaf axils. Each whorl is subtended by large, conspicuous, whitish, purple-tinged, leaf-like bracts.
Plants sometimes require support. These plants do grow in partial shade, but won't produce as many flowers, and may be susceptible to powdery mildew. Spotted Beebalm is high in thymol, which has antimicrobial, anti-fungal and antiseptic properties and was used historically to treat ringworm and hookworm infections. When crushed, the leaves emit an oregano-like scent. The leaves and flowers can be brewed into a mild tea that is said to promote relaxation.
- Full Sun
- Well draining moist soil
- Direct seed after frost danger or start indoors 8 weeks before last frost. Cover seed
- OR start seeds indoors in containers of pre-moistened soil. Scatter the seeds on top – it may be helpful to mix the tiny seed with sand first, as the sand stands out against the soil, making it more obvious where seeds have already been sown.
Gently tamp the seeds down with your fingertips, and cover with plastic wrap or a greenhouse top. These are light-dependent germinators, so keep the seeds warm, moist, and in the light until germination occurs. Seedlings will likely be very closely clustered together. Wait until seedlings have at least two true leaves before attempting to divide. In very dense clusters, thin out unwanted seedlings with a pair of scissors so that the remaining seedlings can grow large enough to be divided. - Germinates: 14 to 21 days @ 18 C
- Harden off seedlings for 2 weeks once they are ready. Transplant to outdoors after several sets of leaves are formed and all risk of frost has passed.
- Spacing: 12 in
- Harvesting: seeds can be harvested 1 to 3 weeks after the flowers bloom. Bend the stems over a paper bag, when the brown seeds start dropping, they are ready to harvest. Can self seed. Deadhead to keep blooming.
- The dried flowers can be used in tea.
- All bergamots are highly attractive to honeybees and other pollinators.

MacGregor Downs Country Club – Cary, NC Wedding Venue
Sample Wedding at MacGregor Downs Country Club
What a wonderful time I had DJing Krystal & Paul’s wedding at MacGregor Downs with her 3 beautiful daughters! They are all so nice and had the most touching wedding on June 28th.
The ceremony was held in the right side ballroom that houses a beautiful fireplace. Rabbi Edery officiated the ceremony on the opposite wall from the fireplace. I provided a mic for him, two readers, and all the music. The Bridesmaids entered to “Watermark” by Enya and Krystal to “A Thousand Years” by The Piano Guys. After the service, they recessed to “No One” by Alicia Keys. While the staff flipped the room for the cocktail hour, I invited guests outside to the lake for a group pic by photographer Kristen from Captivated Photography.
After pics were done, the 60 guests came back inside to get away from the heat and enjoy cocktails. I had a mix of standards, Disney songs (for Krystal’s daughters), and soft rock playing. After the cocktail hour, we invited guests to the dining room down the hall for dinner and dancing.
I introduced the parents and wedding party to “We Are Family” (get it??). Krystal, Paul, and 3 daughters were announced as “The Fab 5”! I Love it!! They came in and had their first dance to “It’s Your Love” by Tim McGraw. They welcomed everyone and thanked everyone for coming. A blessing of the wine and bread followed and the salads and entrees came out. Dinner music was the same as cocktails.
After dinner, I opened the floor with some oldies and top 40 that soon filled it for about 45 minutes. We took a break for the toasts, cake cutting, and then the parents’ dances. Krystal and her Father danced to “Daddy, You’re My Hero” first. Paul and his Mother’s dance was next to “First Lady In My Life”. Both were so sweet!! I had an anniversary dance to “The Way You Look Tonight” with Paul’s Parents winning at 56 years married. Wow!! I opened the floor to everyone again and it stayed filled until the end of the night and the last dance to “Home Sweet Home” by Motley Crue.
Thank you so much, Krystal, Paul, Ava, Ella & Olivia! I am so happy for all of you!!

"Consumer review website features rigorously tested adaptive and accessible product recommendations for consumers with disabilities
Reviewed, a consumer product review website, part of Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) and the USA TODAY NETWORK launched a dedicated Accessibility category, focused on providing in-depth product insights for adaptive products, assistive technology, and accessible design for people with disabilities and their caregivers. This newly expanded section with continuous coverage represents necessary progress for the industry and enables Reviewed to reach a historically underserved audience.
With over one billion people globally living with a disability, accounting for roughly 15% of the global population1, Reviewed’s accessibility coverage aims to take the stress out of product research for consumers with disabilities who often rely on word-of-mouth recommendations and adapt everyday products to fit their specific needs.
Reviewed Accessibility Editor Sarah Kovac, an award-winning author and speaker living with dexterity issues caused by arthrogryposis, will help lead this first-of-its-kind section. Sarah is a passionate and knowledgeable advocate for accessibility given her personal experience, and this category will also serve as a platform to amplify voices from the disabled community.
“I’m proud to see Reviewed recognizing the need to provide increased coverage around accessibility products, filling a void I and other consumers with disabilities have always felt existed,” said Kovac. “A good accessibility product can be the difference between independence and relying on others to survive. I’ve lived it, and so have the contributors on my team, which instills a collective passion that drives our coverage and hopefully emboldens members of our community.”
Reviewed’s Accessibility section will also include product recommendations and insights for consumers who are aging in place and those who care for them.
“We’re seeing more brands than ever looking to break into the accessibility category and we expect this year to be full of products aimed at a broad set of consumers with disabilities,” said Reviewed Editor in Chief David Kender. “Here at Reviewed, we look forward to serving this community with our expanded accessibility coverage and hope it inspires others.”
Since 1997, Reviewed has been committed to applying a scientific, lab-based approach to its product testing and review processes. With an expansive testing facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and over 100 writers, scientists, product experts, editors and contributors, the Reviewed team performs hands-on testing on thousands of products each year to provide readers with the most trusted, informed recommendations.

"Second “Jupiter” investment strengthens Organigram’s European access, including to the high-growth market of Germany
- Concurrent to the investment, Organigram and Sanity Group have entered into a new supply agreement to include significantly higher volumes and the intention to work together on the commercialization of Organigram’s brands and intellectual property (IP) in Germany.
- Investment in the form of an unsecured convertible note combined with a minority equity stake in Sanity Group.
- Organigram entitled to appoint a representative to Sanity Group’s Board of Directors.
Organigram Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: OGI) (TSX: OGI), (the ""Company"" or ""Organigram""), a leading licensed producer of cannabis, is pleased to announce its first significant strategic investment aimed at expanding its presence in the European cannabis market. Using proceeds from its Jupiter strategic investment pool, the Company has agreed to invest €14 million (~ C$21 million) initially comprised of €11.5 million via an unsecured convertible note and €2.5 million to purchase equity interests from existing Sanity Group founders and shareholders providing the Company with a minority stake in Berlin-based cannabis company Sanity Group GmbH (“Sanity” or “Sanity Group”). In addition, the Company may advance another €3 million (~ C$4.5 million) as a second tranche of the unsecured convertible note for future opportunities to be pursued by Sanity subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.

Sanity has quickly established itself as a leader in the German cannabis market where it maintains a robust distribution network with over 2,000 pharmacies working with approximately 5,000 physicians in Germany. Sanity currently holds approximately a 10% share of the German medical cannabis market where its medical brand, avaay, is estimated to hold the number two position and has shown impressive revenue growth since the recent legal reforms regarding partial legalization of adult-use recreational cannabis in Germany. Additionally, Sanity is currently participating in a Swiss recreational cannabis pilot program in the Basel canton, with one store operational and a plan to expand its retail footprint in Switzerland. In the coming months, Sanity is expected to invest in proprietary distribution channels providing it with what it believes will be a competitive advantage that capitalizes on new medical consumers entering the market.
The Company's investment also expands the previously announced supply agreement between Organigram and Sanity Group. Until such time as Organigram receives EU-GMP certification at its Moncton production facility, Sanity Group has committed to purchase significantly higher annual volumes of dried flower under the new agreement as compared to the previous one. Once Organigram receives EU-GMP certification in Moncton, Sanity Group will shift its annual purchase commitment from Organigram to a percentage of its overall assortment of flower offerings for the European market. Organigram expects to complete its final EU-GMP audit before the end of the calendar year. Additionally, the new commercial agreement contemplates, subject to terms and conditions, avenues by which Organigram can launch its industry-leading brands, products, and IP in the German market.
“A meaningful presence in Germany and Europe are essential to achieving our ambitions to be a global cannabis leader. We believe that after Canada, Germany will emerge as one of the more promising markets under a nationally legal model,” said Paolo De Luca, Chief Strategy Officer of Organigram. “With its evolving program for medical cannabis and recent limited legalization for recreational consumption, Germany may eventually adopt a full adult-use cannabis framework. This growth opportunity is magnified by positive regulatory developments in several neighbouring European jurisdictions where Sanity Group is expanding its presence,” he concluded.
“Our investment in Sanity Group establishes a significant European footprint for us. Organigram benefits from Sanity’s expertise and insights in the German (and in the future) other European cannabis markets. This has the potential to provide a pathway for us to launch our own brands and industry-leading IP through Sanity’s extensive distribution network. This relationship also bolsters our European revenue generation through a significantly expanded commercial agreement,” said Beena Goldenberg, CEO of Organigram.
“We are extremely pleased to close this strategic financing with Organigram who has consistently demonstrated itself to be a leader in the highly competitive and regulated Canadian cannabis market,” said Finn Hansel, co-founder and CEO of Sanity Group. “With its commitment to responsible R&D, innovation and product development, including through its relationship with BAT (British American Tobacco), we feel that we have chosen a partner that will support us in becoming a leader in the rapidly expanding legal European markets,” he concluded.
The German and European Cannabis Market
The German cannabis industry is poised for significant expansion following the recreational cannabis legal reforms enacted on April 1, 2024. According to BDSA estimates, Germany is expected to bring in ~USD$1.5 billion in total sales in 2024, set to grow to ~USD$3.7 billion by 2027. This remarkable growth is driven by a 30-50% increase in medical cannabis prescriptions since April 1, 2024, a likely result of the regulatory framework changes that may have accelerated the shift by consumers from the illicit market to the legal market. Germany’s cannabis industry progress is also anticipated to create a ‘ripple effect’, potentially shaping economic, regulatory, public health, and cultural landscapes across Europe. The success of Germany's cannabis industry could serve as a catalyst for a more unified and progressive approach to cannabis legalization and regulation across the continent.
Strategic Rationale and Potential Opportunities
- Establishes a significant European footprint for Organigram through a leading regional cannabis company with a presence in multiple markets.
- Organigram benefits from Sanity’s expertise and insights in the German (and in future) other European cannabis markets.
- Provides a pathway for Organigram to launch its own brands and industry-leading IP in Europe through Sanity’s extensive distribution network.
- Bolsters Organigram’s European revenue generation through an expanded commercial agreement with improved terms and commitments.
- Further investment opportunities may allow Organigram to increase its unsecured convertible note and ownership position in Sanity Group.
- €14 million initial investment consists of €11.5 million structured as an unsecured convertible note (the “Note”) issued by Sanity Group to the Company as lender and €2.5 million of already issued equity interests purchased from existing shareholders.
- The Note yields 10% annual paid-in-kind (PIK) interest for a minimum of three years and is convertible at a discount to the price established by Sanity Group’s next qualified financing into the most senior class of shares (currently Series B).
- Organigram has an option, subject to certain terms and conditions, to invest an additional €3 million on substantially the same terms as the Note which would bring its total investment to €17 million.
- Sanity’s use of proceeds includes investments in various initiatives that are expected to give it access to over 100,000 patients, and aid in recreational cannabis pilot project expansion in applicable regions.
- Notable previous investors in Sanity Group include BAT, Casa Verde Capital (Snoop Dog), Will.i.am (Black Eyed Peas), Navy Capital, Scooter Braun and Alyssa Milano amongst others.

"Former security fund manager Whitney Tilson blew Tesla CEO Elon Musk's latest robot ax development plan in an email to investors this week.
The 52-year-old, who ran Kase Capital Management for about two decades before he closed it down in 2017, said he was willing to bet $ 10,000 on Musk's failure to reach his goal of getting robot action – The automotive industry has compared with a driverless Uber or Lift – on the road by 2020. ""I feel very confident predicting autonomous robot tax for Tesla next year,"" said Musk last month during Tesla's Autonomy Day in California. ""Not in all jurisdictions because we don't want regulatory approval anywhere, but I'm sure we'll get … regulatory approval somewhere, literally next year. ""
Musk recently estimated 1[ads1] million Teslas would have full autonomous capabilities of about a year, giving customers the opportunity to join Tesla's taxi network and make some extra money on the rides through the company's turn-sharing app. r.
But Tilson claimed Musk's timeline is far from realistic.
""Tesla Inc. is a zillion miles from Musk's promise of level 5 by the end of this year and a fleet of one million robot axes by the end of next year,"" Tilson claimed in an email later posted at the business location Value Walk.
""You will bet on charity that Tesla does not come within one year of any of these promises (on the back he raised over $ 2 billion)?"" He then asked and added that he would ""extend this effort to someone – up to $ 10,000. ""
. The director's attention to a Tesla video about the car's autopilot features, says Tilson that it turns out that the car giant is far from level 5 autonomy – as The Verge describes as an autonomous car with ""no geofens"" and ""no restrictions"". There are currently no cars that have achieved that autonomy level, the publication shows.
""If you don't have time to see it, I'll summarize it for you: the autopilot is bad. The driver had to interview dozens of times – every few seconds it worked – To avoid major accidents, Tilson says. ""Elon's claims are far from being a reality,"" he concluded.
Musk has previously admitted that he is not always ""in time"", but claims he eventually gets [the job] done. ""Last year, the 47-year-old billionaire said the businessman is working"" between 80 and 90 hours a week ""to ensure the success of the company.
""In recent years, the hours were much higher. Do not recommend but bad for health and happiness. But no choice or Tesla would die. Hoping to reduce to 80 hours next year,"" he wrote on Twitter.
Running Tesla has been particularly challenging for Musk. The car company reported a loss of $ 702 million in the first quarter of 2019.

Forty-two years ago today, actress Marilyn Monroe was found dead in her Los Angeles home. At the time, police believed her death was a result of an overdose of sleeping pills but over the years there have been many fans who disagree with the official findings.
Rumours were rife of her involvement with the Kennedy brothers and the internet is full of sites covering Marilyn’s life, death and career.
The official Marilyn Monroe website has everything you would expect, with masses of photos, a biography, on-screen appearances and more and the Marilyn Monroe Organisation is another goodie with plenty to offer.
Glamournet’s Marilyn site also has plenty of info and links but with almost the entire first screen of the page taken up with advertisements for Marilyn posters I found the site to be more of a business proposition than a true fan site.

"Sweden is being swept by a strong wave of murder, violent assault, rape, gang rape and sexual assault, in addition to the ever-present terror threat. Instead of using its limited resources to protect its citizens from the violent onslaught against them, Sweden is waging war on its citizens for daring to speak out against the same violent onslaught from which the state is failing to protect them.
Sweden’s War on Free Speech
Åsa Westerberg is a Swedish free speech activist who has been arrested and terrorized for speaking out against the intolerance, abuse and misogyny under Sharia.
Westerberg has been the target of harassment campaigns by migrants and their open border leftist supporters for sharing the effects that Sweden’s suicidal mass-migration crisis has had on her country. These campaigns include harassing Westerberg’s family and friends, trying to brand her as a hateful racist, bankrupting her, trying to ruin her career and mass reporting her to police for ‘thought crimes’.
Special anti-“hate” government goon squads have responded to the lefts request with stunningly totalitarian tactics. Westerberg was first subjected to a house raid.
The three police officers, two men and one woman, systematically went through her apartment and rooted through her belongings. They photographed in her wardrobes, bureaus and in the apartment which caused her to start questioning the police’s actions. While a police officer was photographing her lingerie , she asked what this had to do with her Facebook posts.
A number of mobiles and a computer were taken by police from Åsa’s home and when they left the scene a police officer threatened that he could easily start burning her apartment, which another police officer responded by pointing out that his colleague is a fire investigator.
After the home raid, police went to Westerberg’s workplace, where they conducted another search, and confiscated a computer owned by the company she works for.
Westerberg was also subjected to a brutal arrest by police who broke into her home and abused her during the arrest. She was then taken to a gulag-esque detention center and thrown into isolation for several days, where she was pressured to undergo a DNA test with the threat of further isolation.
Despite being stalked arrested and physically attacked, Westerberg has refused to stop giving a voice to Swedes suffering from the effects of the radical left’s policies of mass Islamic and third world immigration.

Asa Westerberg’s Speech — Many thanks to Kronans Martell (Ullis News) for the translation;
The black man from Skåne, Sweden who encouraged the killing of all the whites and to take over — He continually talked about the white race and the black race and how much he hates the whites. But he is still not a racist! But I am!?
I criticize ideologies which are misogynistic to the core, which sanction pedophilia and hatred, threats and violence; in short it is a disgusting ideology. This makes me a racist!? Because I criticize such ideologies.
The police have drilled my door on two occasions.It was carried out by the new Swedish Opinion Police in which there is a large investment.
The same police don’t have resources to investigate gang-rapes, mass shootings, thefts …There aren’t resources to investigate them?
But if you dare to criticize a pedophile and a false prophet who 1,400 years ago spread a lot of dung to secure his now perverted interests — How dare you criticize him!? Then bang! The police will suddenly show up out of the blue!
Especially if you have become a target for another pedophile and animal-abuser who brags on the media about mass-reporting 1,500 normal Swedish citizens for so-called “incitement to racial hatred”.
For such cases, they have an unlimited amount of resources and come immediately.
The first time [I was arrested for opinion expression] was in April 2016.
Back then I had my Facebook account and followers.
A group of people who were employed by the police authority came early in the morning to my house.
They banged on the door as if there were a fire in the building. They rushed into my apartment and they said that they had a search warrant,
I didn’t get it; I was lost! I didn’t know what it’s all about. I said,
“I haven’t committed any crime, you must have chosen the wrong person.”
The officer said, “You expressed racist views on gypsies and Muslims.”
Oh, hold on a second!
I criticize ideologies and criminal lifestyles.I haven’t expressed any racist views. Are you guys joking or what?!
They were in the apartment searching everywhere, carelessly making a massive mess. I suddenly realized that this is not OK.
I wanted to know what I’m accused of, but they couldn’t disclose that information. They asked me to follow them to my workplace and to let them in.
I didn’t know what my workplace has to do with “incitement to racial hatred”. They couldn’t answer that question, either! I got angry! They sneaked around and took pictures of every drawer and even my underwear.
To spell it out clearly, they behaved in a very vulgar and rude manner.
I got angry and I locked the door and I said to them, “I start working at 12:00 today, what about you?” One of the guys became very angry and he said, “for f***’s sake, behave yourself, otherwise this house might catch on fire.”
It was revealed later that he was a fire inspector who was employed by the police in Västberga (Stockholm), and he had nothing to do with accusations of “incitement to racial hatred”.
And the next day, I went to the police station with a friend. When we got there, the authority said that there is no preliminary investigation against you and not even the issue of a search warrant for your house.
“You must have been fooled.” I had the name of the man who threatened me with “this house might catch on fire.”
I can’t say his name; if I do, I might get into trouble as I once did before, so I won’t repeat it now.
The bottom line is there wasn’t actually any preliminary investigation issued, and there has never been a search warrant for the house.
What they did was completely [illegally] done out of their own initiative.
The police didn’t have any right at all to drill and break in through your [apartment] door. What they have done is worse than the “crime” they are accusing you of.
In normal circumstances, the search warrant would be illegal.
On the other hand, there is the case of the illegal search warrant for a house in 2016.
So I let [the police] open the door and I was sending the footage online to YouTube
Those guys who arrested me then were at least civilized.
They took a sample of my DNA without providing any explanation why the prosecutor required my DNA.
Considering that the “crime” I was accused of was “expressing my views on the internet”, “How would they use my DNA?” Would they use it as a search tool to learn what I have written on the internet?
I don’t think there is any of my DNA there!
Anyways, the second incident was a little bit more violent.
It started with the pedophile animal abuser who runs a terror-hate network Who is an ex-police officer, and I can’t name him [because of the police], but you still know who I mean.
He is obsessed with me, and he runs a mass-reporting campaign. Because of his continuous accusation I was apprehended by the police.
On the second occasion, they came in by drilling my door. I was waiting for them to come in. I intended to follow them completely willingly.
I was filming it while the security cameras were on as well.
They rushed into the apartment with pointed batons, they knocked me down onto the floor. They literally beat me so harshly until I bled here on my jaw.
When one of the police officers slammed me against the wall, he slammed me against the kitchen cupboard until it burst. They handcuffed me from behind; they literally kicked the s*** out of me.
I was taken to the same prison in Kungsholmen [Stockholm].
I was interrogated by the “Common Ethical Foundation” police authority. I said that I will report this arrest to the police because of aggressive violence, and asked for a doctor to check me out.
But they refused!
The policewoman who was there… she looked very “feminist”; she was also working for the “common ethical” police.
She asked the officers who assaulted me to mention that I violently refused to comply. Which I absolutely didn’t!
And I had the security cameras filming all of this; the system was controlled by my phone, which they confiscated when they arrested me.
After a lengthy series of ifs and buts, I was able to eventually meet my lawyer. I asked them to “give me the phone first so I can show the footage to my lawyer, and then you can do whatever you want with it.”
They refused! I said, “I hope the videos are still on my phone when I get it back!”
She said, “Yes, sure; we aren’t allowed to delete anything from your phone.” I know, but I still hope that they remain on my phone when I get it back.
Do you think they remained in my phone when I got it back? No! I’m also suspicious that they have probably bugged my apartment, even though I don’t have any evidence; it’s just a feeling.
Because when they knocked me down on the floor, two of the three big fellows, two of them seemed to be from the “baseball league” (violent and secret dirty cops).
All the police officers had their badges on and showed their names
except those two who knocked me down. One of them discovered the security camera and asked me, “Do you have cameras?”
I said, “Maybe,” and I smiled a little. Suddenly, he became mild and nice after being brutally violent.
I asked him if I could see his ID badge. This is very interesting; if someone knows what it is, there are many police officers around here who can probably explain later.
They showed their IDs. The only visible parts were their images, the police label, but their names were completely redacted.
I don’t know what their names were; there were some sort of numbers, but I don’t know who they are.
These are not the normal and usual police who are assigned to such cases.
I thought right away of “the baseball league” (violent secret dirty cops) when I first saw them.
I have also published a video on YouTube explaining the first break-in and door-drilling and how weird it was.
It’s very remarkable that they use such means to ‘counter crime of expressing opinion’ while the [same police authority] is incapable of arresting gang-rapists, but is capable of arresting ‘criminals of expression’.
The police won’t drill into house of the pedophile and animal abuser who mass-reports people like me; they can’t drill through their doors.
They don’t even drill the doors of child-rapists and animal killers. But they can certainly drill my doors!
This is what I mentioned as remarkable!",0.9836095571517944,2565,1.300984501838684

"Poland has put its gamblers on notice that playing with international online gambling sites not expressly licensed by the state could land you in a world of trouble. Last week, the Polish Ministry of Finance posted a notice informing gamblers that wagering with unsanctioned operators could result in criminal prosecution. This marks a break with the country’s enforcement tactics, which previously had been reserved for those caught promoting or marketing for international sites.
The notice says the Ministry of Finance has identified over 24k players patronizing international sites, 17,700 of which have won a combined PLN 27m (US $8m). The notice says 1,100 investigations have been launched in this area, with extra attention being paid to those bettors who have earned the most or who prove most reluctant to curtail their illegal activity.
Poland officially approved online sports betting in 2011 but onerous regulations, including the need to incorporate a company within Poland and tax rates as high as 12% of turnover depending on the activity, have attracted just four Polish-licensed operators: Fortuna Entertainment, Milenium, STS and Intralot subsidiary Totolotek. These four operators are believed to capture only about 9% of the country’s online gambling market, which the Roland Berger consulting firm estimated to be worth an annual PLN 4.9b ($1.5b).
Poland has since drafted amendments to its Gambling Act that would allow EU-based operators to merely establish a Polish branch office for tax purposes and open a Polish bank account. The European Commission (EC) is scheduled to review the amendments by February 6. Sadly, there appears little movement on Poland widening its online gambling options beyond sports betting although Poland was one of the nations which received an “official request for information” from the EC regarding their online gambling legislation in November 2013.",0.9696376323699951,378,0.930158257484436

Currently, he is disoriented and has a bruise on the left temple. He looks frail, with a few bruises on his arms and legs. He is under-weight and his clothes are dirty.
Mr. Barker has type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease. He had an episode of congestive heart failure a few months ago and was admitted to hospital for two weeks. He was started on rivaroxaban anticoagulation during this hospitalization to prevent stroke. His aspirin was stopped at that time.
I ordered a CT head which showed generalized cerebral atrophy and evidence of microvascular ischemia. There was no intracranial bleeding.
In 2016, 17% of the Canadian population was over the age of 651, yet they accounted for 22% of emergency department patients2. By 2036, seniors will account for a quarter of our population1. This is the future of emergency medicine.
In 2015, the Canadian Medical Association called for the development of a national seniors strategy that would include evidence-based hospital practices that better meet seniors’ physical, cognitive and psychosocial needs3. In 2018, there is a striking lack of evidence to guide senior emergency care.
One in six patients with intracranial bleeding caused by a simple fall, will die in hospital4,5. Falls at home on level ground are the single most common cause of traumatic brain injury5–9, yet there are no trauma codes for these patients and they can wait hours to be seen in the emergency department. The conundrum for emergency physicians is that only 5% of seniors who present to the emergency department after a fall will have an intracranial bleed10. So although falls in seniors are a common cause of intracranial bleeding with a grave prognosis, we see 20 similar patients for every one patient who has a bleed. Traumatic intracranial bleeding events will only increase as our senior population grows.
The Canadian CT head rule11 can be applied to patients giving a clear history of head impact, if the patient verifies there was loss of consciousness, disorientation or amnesia. Our local data shows 80% of seniors who fall do not fit this category. It is not possible to order a CT head on every senior who has had a trip or fall. Quite apart from overloading the radiology department, there is often a delay of hours to the scan and many Canadian emergency departments do not have 24-hour access to CT scanning. There is a need for a structured decision tool to aid emergency physicians in their decision to order CT head scans.
We are a group of researchers working to develop a clinical decision rule for seniors who present to the emergency department after a fall. We are asking emergency physicians about their normal practice.
Thank you for taking 5 minutes to complete this important survey with a goal of helping us to improve the care we give these patients.",0.9706299304962158,732,2.4298815727233887

"Parkinson’s disease is a condition that affects populations all over the globe. In fact, it is estimated that over 10 million people live with the condition worldwide.
Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative health condition that affects the nerve cells in the brain that control the body’s movement.
The disease is a progressive condition with the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease increasing gradually as time goes by.
The condition received its name via James Parkinson who is a London doctor that first reported symptoms related to the condition in the early 1800s.
What Are Common Symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease?
One of the hard things about treating Parkinson’s disease is that symptoms vary widely among patients. It’s a condition that seems to affect many patients differently.
Some of the more common symptoms are broken up into two categories – those that affect the patient’s motor function and those that do not.
Common symptoms related to motor function include movement tremors, the ‘freezing’ of physical functions, and rigidity.
Common non-motor function-related symptoms include fatigue/tiredness, depression, and ongoing physical pain.
Symptoms tend to appear more often among people that are 60 years old or older, however, people can develop symptoms earlier in life as well.
Cannabis as a Treatment
Some of the more common pharmaceutical treatments for Parkinson’s disease involve dopamine promoters, pain medications, antidepressants, cognition-enhancing medications, and anti-tremor medications.
Every one of those pharmaceutical drugs come with their own varying levels of side-effects and other potential dangers such as severe addiction.
Cannabis, on the other hand, is not nearly as harmful as the previously mentioned medications, which is likely why more Parkinson’s patients are using the cannabis plant for medical purposes.
A recent survey of Parkinson’s patients found that nearly 1 out of every 4 are using medical cannabis to treat their condition.
The researchers behind the survey are pushing for more research to learn more about best practices when treating Parkinson’s with cannabis, which is an ongoing issue.
“Our results suggest that although there are many people with PD using cannabis as a [complementary alternative] treatment for their motor and non-motor symptoms, the lack of formal guidance about cannabis usage for PD may underlie inconsistencies in use and reported effectiveness,” researchers concluded.",0.9600678086280823,504,3.0834102630615234
"Keeping your car looking like it’s straight off the dealer’s lot may seem impossible. The wear and tear of everyday driving surely takes its toll. But, that does not mean that there aren’t solutions that you can use to keep your car in mint condition, making it not only aesthetically pleasing, but easier to take care of. Ceramic coating is one of those solutions, and it is a great tool for vehicle owners who want to add an extra layer of protection to their cars!
Industry-grade ceramic coating is a chemical polymer solution that you put on a vehicle’s exterior to protect the paint. Generally hand applied, it adds a hydrophobic layer of protection.
While many vehicle enthusiasts and even detailers mistake ceramic coating for clear bra (paint protection film), it is actually a wax substitute. The basic goal is to keep dirt, filth, and stains off the paint and clear coat.
Ceramic coating, also known as nano-ceramic coating, is a permanent or semi-permanent solution to your problems. It does not decompose in normal atmospheric conditions such as rain or heat.
Ceramic Coating Benefits
Ceramic coatings are permanent and easier to clean once applied. Here are a few more reasons to use it in your car:
UV Ray Protection
Just like UV rays can damage our skin, they can also be very harmful to your vehicle’s paint, especially in Las Vegas. Ceramic coating prevents oxidation, fading, and dulling of your car’s paint. This is vital if you park outside.
Chemical Stain Resistance
Acidic pollutants in the air might cause chemical stains on your car. A coating prevents impurities from adhering to the surface. With the city’s air pollution rising, ceramic coating can be a tremendous help.
Washing your car becomes a hassle when you also have to wax and polish it. This is not something you need to worry about with ceramic coating.
It blends in with your car’s paint and repels water. Water-based filth will bead on the surface and gradually slip off. After a fast wash, your car will be looking pristine again.
Ceramic coating, like car bra, adds gloss and depth to your paint. It will give your car a shiny finish, enhancing the original paint job.
But there are still some myths and false information floating around about improved protection. Listed below are some prevalent ceramic coating myths.
False Claims About Ceramic Coating
While ceramic coating is a fantastic product that we believe every car owner should invest in, there are still some myths that surround it that we want to address.
Scratches and Swirl Marks Protection
Cars with ceramic coating will not be protected against scratches, swirl marks, or rock chips. It is still like the paint on your car. If this is something you’re worried about, you should look for paint protection films instead.
Water Spotting Protection
As previously stated, water-based pollutants will bead on your car’s surface and eventually slip off. After the water evaporates, they still contain natural minerals and soluble particles.
The water spots that arise from this require a more hands-on approach to remove.
There Is Still a Need For Car Washes
You must still wash your car regularly. A ceramic coating doesn’t make your car self-cleaning.
Is it worth it?
As we’ve seen, ceramic coating has many advantages that add value to your car. It will make cleaning and maintaining it easier. So you may spend more time driving and enjoying your car than worrying about its safety.
A one-stop answer for all your paint woes? We’d say no. No single product on the market can fully safeguard your car. Even still, ceramic coating is one of the best automobile paint protection options available today.
The expense of ceramic coating versus annual maintenance and waxing is also a no-brainer.
Regular maintenance is the key to keeping your car looking good. If you live in Las Vegas, NV, and want to learn more about the wonders of ceramic coating and the value it adds to your car, contact us today.",0.9501522779464722,876,1.9330774545669556

"California’s Caste Discrimination Lawsuit Blatantly and Repeatedly Violates American Civil Rights
(Editor's Note: This article has been updated to reflect that the baseless and xenophobic caste lawsuit filed by the California Civil Rights Department (CRD) on behalf of a self-identifying Dalit against two Cisco employees (Sundar Iyer and Ramana Kompella) has been dismissed, leaving the employees vindicated. The case lacked factual support and relied on a debunked report by Equality Labs to bolster its claims of widespread caste discrimination in the tech sector, including at Cisco. The judge's refusal to accept the report as evidence in February 2021 proves that the State of California violated civil rights and attempted to attribute wrongdoing to Hindus and Indian Americans based on their religion or ethnicity.)
Imagine you’re an irreligious American, one amongst an estimated 100 million. Not just that, you’ve been publicly irreligious. You’ve even professed in a writing in a blog. And, for over 20 years. You’ve even revealed that explicitly to a state’s prosecutorial agency. Facts that were known to the agency for at least three years. Yet, the State claims that you’re a Hindu while suing you for alleged workplace discrimination. There goes your First Amendment Constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.
Imagine you’re a religious American, one amongst an estimated 300 million. You mind your business and go to your local church, mosque, temple, synagogue …. You subscribe to the constitutional separation of church and state. Yet, a state prosecutor interprets your holy books and tells you what they believe is wrong with your religion. There go your rights under the First Amendment establishment clause! Not outraged? Well, here’s more!
Imagine you’re a 1st generation American immigrant, one amongst an estimated 15 million. Your state accuses you, your supervisors and several co-workers of importing an alleged ancient discriminatory religious practice from India called caste which they define as a part of Hinduism. The state further assigns you an upper or lower caste Hindu religious categorization. You may have never ascribed to caste. But California’s Civil Rights Department (CRD) says, to hell with your Equal Protection and Due Process Rights. It gets worse … Some of you are not even Hindu. Some of you are not even Indian!
Imagine you’re a workplace American supervisor, one amongst millions. The State interviews you for less than 15 minutes. You’re accused of caste harassment. No claims of harassing conduct are pled against you despite 7 years of the Plaintiff’s workplace employment. Your most severe crime … following your boss’s orders to ask the Plaintiff to file weekly status reports. By now you already know that the California Civil Rights Department does not care about your Due Process Civil rights
The recent lawsuit filed by the California Civil Rights Division (CRD) – previously the Department of Fair Employment and Housing's (DFEH) – on behalf of “John Doe”( a self-identifying member of the Dalit caste ), alleging Dalit caste discrimination at Cisco's San Jose headquarters has caused concern among various communities. Article ‘…’ shed light on court documents that show deliberate prosecutorial misconduct that they hid from the judge that all of the leadership positions in this group were first offered to different meritorious Dalit. This ""cry wolf"" tactic that is harming the cause of genuine discrimination faced by Dalits and in doing so the CRD has created unnecessary alarm and prejudice among Indian and Hindu communities.
While it is important to fight against genuine cases of discrimination, the lawsuit filed on behalf of ""John Doe"" has been criticized for harming the image of Hindus and causing worry among South Asians and Indian Americans about their career prospects as the Plaintiffs have provided zero evidence to substantiate the claims presented by a self-proclaimed Dalit ""Doe"" that he failed to secure a head of engineering position from his previous employers on the basis of his caste.
The lawsuit has also raised concerns among Hindu Americans and those perceived to be Hindus, including South Asian Sikhs, Jains, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, and others of South Asian origin. These individuals are worried that they will be caught in the net of caste-based insinuations and projected as belonging to a religion of inequity. This concern is especially significant as there already exists broad anti-discriminatory protections available in California and under US law.
In addition to the multiple violations of the First Amendment Freedom of Religion and the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection and Due Process Rights the state does not even give a meaningful definition of caste (let alone upper or lower caste categorizations) making any such argument constitutionally void for vagueness. Most Indians living in North America are not even aware of their “Caste” and do not subscribe to such ideology.
The CRD’s blatant violation of the constitutional rights of American citizens and immigrants is all the more shocking when reviewing public court documents. A previous article … explores the CRD’s targeting of Hindu Americans over nine times in three different Courts, accusing them of physical assault, rapes, as well as making racially divisive claims of alleged upper caste biological superiority, and questioning their over representation and success in Silicon Valley. This case is nothing more than a prejudiced and lethal campaign to insinuate unrest among Indian Americans and present them unfavorably to future employers, particular in the STEM industries, and harming their career prospects. This insinuation of allegations based on several constitutional violations to force a religious caste identity on defendants is bound to set a dangerous precedent that will have far-reaching repercussions in American companies. It is crucial to address discrimination in all forms, but it must be done in a way that is fair, just, and does not harm innocent people.",0.951278030872345,1196,1.646256685256958

Despite its small size, the country boasts an impressive array of natural resources that are vital to its economy and environmental goals. From vast tropical forests and rich biodiversity to renewable energy sources and fertile agricultural land, Costa Rica natural resources are abundant and carefully managed to ensure a greener future. This commitment has made Costa Rica a global leader in conservation and eco-friendly development.
Main Costa Rica Natural Resources
Forests and Biodiversity
Costa Rica is home to about 6% of the world’s biodiversity, a remarkable feat for a small country. Over 25% of its land is protected as national parks, reserves, and wildlife refuges. This protection helps conserve countless plant and animal species, many of which are unique or endangered.
The country’s forests, including tropical rainforests, cloud forests, and dry forests, provide valuable resources like medicinal plants and timber. These forests also play a crucial role in carbon sequestration, absorbing more carbon dioxide than Costa Rica emits. This supports the nation’s goal of carbon neutrality. Additionally, eco-tourism, driven by Costa Rica’s biodiversity, generates millions of dollars each year and benefits local communities.
Renewable Energy Sources
Costa Rica is a global leader in renewable energy. Nearly all of the country’s electricity comes from renewable sources. The diverse landscape, rich in rivers, geothermal activity, and sunshine, makes Costa Rica ideal for clean energy production.
- Hydropower: Costa Rica’s rivers generate most of the country’s electricity. The mountainous terrain and frequent rainfall provide a reliable water supply for energy production, particularly in the rainy season.
- Geothermal Energy: Costa Rica, located along the Pacific Ring of Fire, has access to geothermal energy from volcanic activity. This resource is increasingly harnessed, particularly during dry periods when hydropower is less reliable.
- Wind and Solar: Wind farms in Guanacaste and solar panels nationwide help diversify Costa Rica’s energy portfolio. These sources ensure a steady energy supply year-round and contribute to the country’s goal of carbon neutrality.
Costa Rica’s location between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea gives it rich marine resources. Its waters are home to diverse marine life, including coral reefs, fish, and other aquatic species, vital to both biodiversity and the economy.
- Fisheries: Costa Rica prioritizes sustainable fishing practices, protecting certain species and combating overfishing. Fish exports and local fisheries provide significant income and food for coastal communities.
- Marine Biodiversity and Tourism: Marine reserves like Cocos Island National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, attract divers and marine biologists. Tourism activities such as whale watching, scuba diving, and snorkeling generate substantial revenue and promote conservation.
Agricultural Land and Fertile Soil
Costa Rica’s fertile soils, especially in the Central Valley and coastal plains, make it an ideal location for agriculture. The country’s rich volcanic soil is perfect for growing crops like coffee, bananas, pineapples, and sugarcane, which are key exports for the nation.
- Coffee: Costa Rica is famous for its high-quality coffee, which is grown in volcanic soils at high altitudes. Coffee production not only supports the economy but is also a cultural staple.
- Bananas and Pineapples: Costa Rica is one of the world’s largest exporters of bananas and pineapples. These industries provide employment for thousands of Costa Ricans and are essential for the country’s agricultural economy. Learn more about Costa Rica Tropical fruits in our blog.
- Sustainable Agriculture: Costa Rica has taken significant steps to promote sustainable farming practices. Organic farming, permaculture, and agroforestry are growing trends, as farmers and businesses recognize the value of preserving the land for future generations.
Costa Rica’s abundant rainfall ensures a plentiful supply of freshwater, supporting agriculture, energy generation, and daily life. Freshwater resources come from rivers, lakes, and underground aquifers.
- Rivers and Lakes: Costa Rica’s rivers not only support hydropower but also provide water for irrigation, drinking, and recreational activities.
- Watersheds and Conservation: Watershed management is a priority in Costa Rica, where protecting water quality is crucial for both human use and ecosystems. Efforts to reduce pollution and maintain clean water sources are supported by government policies and community initiatives.
Minerals and Geological Resources
Costa Rica’s restrictive policy on mineral extraction protects its environment, but the country still has valuable geological resources. Its volcanic regions provide geothermal energy, and construction materials like limestone are produced.
Costa Rica has chosen to limit mineral exploitation to avoid environmental harm. This decision reflects the country’s long-term ecological vision over short-term economic gains, making it unique among nations with similar resources.

"In the ancient Roman religion, Janus was the god of new beginnings. He is depicted as having two faces, one looking back into the past, the other looking forward toward the future. January is named after him and so is the janitor who opens and closes doors.
Janus brings to mind two things: that the past year was filled with mistakes on a social level and, on a personal level, missed opportunities. Hence our desire for a fresh beginning, one that atones for the sins of the past. “Cheer to a new year,” advises Oprah Winfrey, “and another chance to get it right”. We have failed to fulfill the hopes of years gone by, and thirst for yet another chance.
We live by a combination of regret and hope. We love things that are new precisely because they bring us hope. Yet, the new car, the new house, the new job, the new dress, the new suit do not remain new and soon slip into the realm of the hum-drum. They no longer fascinate us. The new chapter in my life that was waiting to be written, turns out to be disappointing.
G. K. Chesterton put the New Year nicely into perspective for us when he said, “The object of the New Year is not that we should have a new year, It is that we should have a new soul . . .” He would have cheerfully agreed with Charles Lamb who declared that “New Year’s Day is everyman’s birthday”. Nonetheless, we make New Year’s resolutions that we fail to keep and fall back into the less than virtuous habits of the previous year.
Why is it perennially difficult for us to be born again, to forge a new soul? No doubt it is because we need help from above to fulfill our resolutions and become the person we hoped to be. “At present we are on the outside of the world,” wrote C. S. Lewis, “the wrong side of the door.” “We discern the freshness and purity of the morning, but they do not make us fresh and pure. We cannot mingle with the splendour we see.”
Lewis is expressing a frustration we all feel when our efforts to rid ourselves of our faults and become a better person fail to materialize. Among the many things that tempt us with their newness, but remains eternally new is the New Testament. In order to reform, to open the door to a holier life, we must look to Christ for assistance. Lewis goes on to say, in memorable prose, “But all the leaves of the New Testament are rustling with the rumor that it will not be so. Someday, God willing, we shall get in”.
The New Year opens the door to a new life. Christ dons the role of a janitor who is a specialist in opening doors that lead to a new world that is illuminated by grace. “Happy New Year” should give way to “Blessed New Year.” The New Year should follow the inspiration and guidance of the New Testament.",0.9653887152671814,657,2.302835464477539
"As cat owners, we always want to ensure the safety and well-being of our feline companions. When it comes to their dietary habits, it’s essential to be cautious about what they consume. Aquaphor is a popular ointment used for various purposes, including moisturizing the skin, treating minor cuts, and soothing dryness. However, can cats eat Aquaphor? In this article, we will explore the potential risks and safety considerations associated with cats consuming Aquaphor.
The Potential Risks for Cats
- Ingestion: Cats are curious by nature, and they may try to lick or consume substances they come across, including Aquaphor. Ingesting Aquaphor can lead to various complications, primarily due to the ingredients it contains.
- Gastrointestinal Issues: The petroleum-based ingredients in Aquaphor can be difficult for cats to digest. Ingesting a significant amount may cause stomach upset, diarrhea, or vomiting.
- Obstruction: The thick consistency of Aquaphor can pose a risk of intestinal obstruction if a cat ingests a large amount. This can be a serious condition requiring immediate veterinary attention.
- Toxic Ingredients: While the primary ingredients in Aquaphor are generally safe for human use, they may not be suitable for cats. Cats have specific metabolic processes that differ from humans, and certain ingredients in Aquaphor could be toxic to them.
- Skin Irritation: Applying Aquaphor topically on cats’ skin may not be harmful in small amounts, but excessive use or contact with sensitive areas could potentially cause skin irritation or allergic reactions.
- Veterinary Consultation: Before using any product on your cat, especially if it’s not specifically formulated for feline use, it’s crucial to consult with a veterinarian. They can provide guidance based on your cat’s specific needs and advise on safe alternatives if necessary.
- Secure Storage: To prevent accidental ingestion, it’s important to store Aquaphor and similar products in a safe place where cats cannot access them.
- Alternative Options: If your cat has a skin condition or requires moisturization, consult your veterinarian for cat-friendly alternatives. They may recommend products specifically designed for feline use.
- Observation and Monitoring: If you suspect your cat has ingested Aquaphor or any other potentially harmful substance, observe their behavior closely and look for any signs of distress or abnormal symptoms. Contact your veterinarian immediately if you notice any concerning changes.
Can I apply Aquaphor on my cat’s skin?
It is not recommended to apply Aquaphor or any human skincare products on your cat’s skin without consulting a veterinarian first. Cats have sensitive skin and different physiological processes than humans, so it’s important to use products specifically formulated for feline use.
What should I do if my cat ingests Aquaphor?
If you suspect that your cat has ingested Aquaphor, it is important to monitor their behavior closely. Look for any signs of distress or abnormal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or lethargy. Contact your veterinarian immediately for guidance and seek professional advice.
How can I prevent my cat from accessing Aquaphor?
To prevent accidental ingestion, store Aquaphor and similar products in a secure place where your cat cannot reach them. Consider using childproof containers or keeping them in cabinets or drawers that are inaccessible to your cat.
Can I use Aquaphor on my cat’s paws?
It is not recommended to use Aquaphor or any human skincare products on your cat’s paws without veterinary guidance. Cats groom themselves and may ingest the product when licking their paws, which can lead to potential complications. Consult with your veterinarian for appropriate paw care options for your cat.
Can Aquaphor be toxic to cats if they lick it off their fur?
While licking a small amount of Aquaphor off their fur may not cause immediate toxicity in cats, it is still not recommended. Cats have a grooming instinct, and they can ingest more significant amounts while trying to clean themselves. The petroleum-based ingredients in Aquaphor can be difficult for cats to digest and may lead to gastrointestinal issues or other complications. It’s best to prevent your cat from licking or ingesting any products that are not specifically formulated for feline use.
Are there any cat-friendly moisturizers or ointments that I can use instead of Aquaphor?
Yes, there are cat-friendly moisturizers and ointments available that are specifically formulated for feline use. These products are designed to address common skin issues in cats and are safe for them to lick and groom. Your veterinarian can recommend suitable alternatives based on your cat’s specific needs.
Can Aquaphor be harmful if applied in small amounts on my cat’s dry nose or paw pads?
Applying Aquaphor in small amounts on your cat’s dry nose or paw pads may not be immediately harmful. However, it is still best to consult with a veterinarian for appropriate alternatives specifically designed for feline use. Some cats may be more sensitive to certain ingredients, and excessive use or prolonged contact may lead to skin irritation or other adverse reactions.
Is it safe to use Aquaphor on other pets, such as dogs?
While Aquaphor is generally considered safe for human use, it is important to remember that different species have different physiological processes and sensitivities. It is best to consult with a veterinarian before using Aquaphor or any human skincare products on other pets to ensure their safety and well-being.
While Aquaphor is generally safe for human use, it is not recommended for cats. The potential risks, including gastrointestinal issues, obstruction, and toxic ingredients, make it essential to keep Aquaphor away from cats and seek feline-specific alternatives for their skincare needs. Remember, the well-being of your cat should always be your top priority, and consulting with a veterinarian is crucial when it comes to their health and safety.",0.9172673225402832,1248,2.406951665878296

"The Reservoir met the aquatic life standards for temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH in WY 2021.
The Reservoir met the temperature standards established for the Class I Warm Water Aquatic Life classification established by the Water Quality Control Commission (WQCC) in Regulation No. 31 (Reg 31) of 26.2 ˚C Maximum Weekly Average Temperature (MWAT) and 29.3 ˚C Daily Maximum (DM). The maximum temperature measured during the reservoir monitoring events and the continuous monitoring thermistors was 26.3˚C (79.3 ⁰F) but only for a period of 15 minutes.
Reg31 states that in ”the upper portion of a lake or reservoir, dissolved oxygen shall not be less than 5.0 mg/L. There needs to be adequate refuge for aquatic with DO levels greater than 5.0 mg/L available at other depths or locations in the Reservoir at the same time period.”
During WY 2021, there were events when measured DO concentrations in the Reservoir were below 5.0 mg/L at or near the bottom. However, during the same time periods, the DO concentrations near the surface were greater than 5.0 mg/L, meeting the Reg 31 standard. Periods of low dissolved oxygen indicate high microbial activity or decomposition in the hypolimnion and sediments which reduces DO concentrations.
During WY 2021, the pH ranged between 7.9 and 8.8, which meets the instantaneous minimum and maximum standards of 6.5 and 9.0, respectively. The higher pH values appeared to correlate with higher productivity and elevated chlorophyll α in the reservoir.

"In a very interesting article in Cell Reports Medicine Andrew Huberman and collaegues report a remote, randomized, controlled study of three different daily 5-min breathwork exercises compared with an equivalent period of mindfulness meditation over 1 month.
The Highlights of the outcomes are:
👉🏿 Daily 5-minute breathwork and mindfulness meditation improve mood and reduce anxiety
👉🏼 Breathwork improves mood and physiological arousal more than mindfulness meditation
👉 Cyclic sighing is most effective at improving mood and reducing respiratory rate
Controlled breathing directly influences respiratory rate, which can cause more immediate physiological and psychological calming effects by increasing vagal tone during slow expiration. While mindfulness meditation might decrease sympathetic tone in the long run, that is not its primary purpose or an expected acute effect.
The conclusion of the authors is that daily 5-min cyclic sighing has promise as an effective stress management exercise.
It needs to be mentioned that this research zoomed in on a very small part of mindfulness practice and its effects; namely, on the practice of letting ones attention rest on the breath, and on the effects of this practice on stress and mood regulation. Though mindfulness has at its core ‘intentionality’ , Mindfulness is a natural trainable human capacity that helps bring attention to all experiences with wise discernment and conveys attitudes of curiosity, friendliness and compassion. The effects of these qualities reach far beyond regulating personal stress and mood regulation.
So combining the practice of cyclic breathing -for direct stress and mood regulation- and the practice of mindfulness -for cultivating awareness, wise discernment, curiosity and compassion- will provide tools and skills to live our lives with more ease, more skillfully and to meet other beings and our environment with kindness, care, curiosity and compassion.",0.9241202473640442,365,2.3150951862335205
"Efficient and accurate modelling of chemical reactions in the condensed phase represents one of the ‘grand challenges’ in computational chemistry. While characterizing reaction energy pathways has become routine, exploring these processes while accounting for solvent and dynamics effects remains a time-consuming and non-systematic endeavour. Solvent effects, in particular, significantly impact reaction rates, selectivity, and the reaction mechanism itself.
In this talk, I will discuss our ongoing efforts to model reactions in solution using machine learning potentials (MLPs) as efficient surrogates for traditional ab initio methods. [1-3] Our approach, implemented in the mlp-train package (https://github.com/duartegroup/mlp-train), integrates electronic structure methods, different MLP architectures, and active learning to generate the training sets on the fly and train MLPs in low data regime. Through illustrative examples using the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework  and its message-passing neural network variant (MACE) [5-6] we demonstrate that this approach facilitates the creation of data-efficient training sets that adequately sample the chemical space to achieve the required accuracy while maintaining significantly low computational costs. Furthermore, we combine this strategy with enhanced sampling techniques, such as metadynamics, to explore the energy landscape during the training phase, which is particularly challenging when investigating reactive processes. We discuss the influence of descriptors and models, training strategy, and ground truth method, as well as different metrics to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the generated MLPs for different organic chemical reactions.

"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — David Rebuck, who oversaw New Jersey’s development of nation-leading internet gambling and sports betting industries and advised more than two dozen states on setting up and regulating their own gambling operations, retired Friday after 13 years as one of America’s most influential gambling regulators.
Rebuck, 71, stepped down as director of the state Division of Gaming Enforcement after leading New Jersey though a turbulent period when some Atlantic City casinos closed and the state became a leader in emerging forms of gambling including sports betting, which came about after the state won a U.S. Supreme Court case to permit it.
“This industry is never dull,” he said. “There are always going to be challenges and opportunities. We wanted to be the pinnacle of regulating the industry so that the casinos would have a better chance of success while protecting customers.”
Rebuck was appointed by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in 2011 at a time when Atlantic City’s casinos were reeling from competitive economic pressures from casinos in neighboring states.
“The marching orders were clear: to implement the law that had just passed,” he said. “There was a feeling on the part of the casinos that they were overly regulated by rules that hadn’t been updated since the 1970s.”
A streamlined governmental oversight system helped reduce some of the casinos’ overhead expenses. But it would not prove enough to prevent five of the 12 casinos from shutting down in less than two years; two of them have since reopened.
“You thought you were doing everything you could do to help them survive in this market, and it didn’t work,” he said. “It was a tough time.”
A year later, in 2013, Rebuck presided over one of New Jersey’s greatest triumphs: the start of internet gambling. New Jersey led the nation in online gambling for 10 years until Michigan surpassed it by a small fraction last year in terms of the amount of money won from gamblers.
When Democrat Phil Murphy succeeded Republican Christie as governor in 2018, he kept Rebuck on as chief gambling regulator.
That year, Rebuck led the creation of rules and regulations for New Jersey’s sports betting industry after the state prevailed in its longshot legal battle to overturn a federal ban on it in all but four states. That U.S. Supreme Court ruling led the way for all 50 states to offer legal sports betting if they so chose; 38 states plus Washington, D.C, currently do.
Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling market, said Rebuck helped launch “new gaming products that are changing the industry and keeping New Jersey at the top of the national market.”
Rebuck has also been highly sought for his advice and technical expertise by other states considering adopting new gambling operations or modernizing existing ones. He said he has advised and worked with more than two dozen states in this regard.
“We’d give them our actual book, and say, ‘This is what we do, this is how we do it and this is how you can do it,’” he said. “This is a copycat industry; once people see something that works, they want to do it, too.”
Mark Giannantonio, president of Atlantic City’s Resorts casino and of the Casino Association of New Jersey, called Rebuck “a thoughtful and progressive gaming regulator who advanced so many aspects of gaming in New Jersey.”
With internet gambling, “Dave led the team at DGE and built from the ground up the policies and regulations that created a whole new innovative business for New Jersey in a safe and secure manner,” Giannantonio said. “These regulations have been duplicated across the country.”
Mary Jo Flaherty, deputy director of the gaming enforcement division, will serve as interim director for an unspecified period.",0.9722998142242432,848,1.2297240495681763
"That prenatal events can have life-long consequences is now well established. Nevertheless, research on the Fetal Origins Hypothesis is flourishing and has expanded to include the early childhood (postnatal) environment. Why does this literature have a “second act?” We summarize the major themes and contributions driving the empirical literature since our 2011 reviews, and try to interpret the literature in light of an overarching conceptual framework about how human capital is produced early in life. One major finding is that relatively mild shocks in early life can have substantial negative impacts, but that the effects are often heterogeneous reflecting differences in child endowments, budget constraints, and production technologies. Moreover, shocks, investments, and interventions can interact in complex ways that are only beginning to be understood. Many advances in our knowledge are due to increasing accessibility of comprehensive administrative data that allow events in early life to be linked to long-term outcomes. Yet, we still know relatively little about the interval between, and thus about whether it would be feasible to identify and intervene with affected individuals at some point between early life and adulthood. We do know enough, however, to be able to identify some interventions that hold promise for improving child outcomes in early life and throughout the life course.",0.9523811936378479,249,2.5759406089782715
"Radiology staff at the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv are making steady progress with their plan to restore normal service after a devastating missile attack.
On 9 July 2024, AuntMinnieEurope.com posted an article about the extensive damage caused to Ukraine's largest pediatric hospital. Dr. Stanislav Rebenkov, head of radiology, and his team are gradually starting to rebuild the department.
""On Friday, our hospital received 7 Butterfly iQ+ ultrasound devices, which will be indispensable in our work with the pediatric patients,"" he said in a Facebook post on 21 October. ""These devices will significantly enhance our diagnostic capabilities, especially in the intensive care, emergency, and pediatric departments.""
The donation was the work of First Read Initiative (FRI), a charitable fund that aims to make diagnostic imaging accessible to patients in unserved and underserved regions around the globe, in collaboration with Dr. Douglas Davis and Dr. Olga Maihutiak at MedGlobal and the Ukrainian Medical Association of North America (UMANA).
Radiologist Dr. Josh Sokol, a founder of the FRI who works with teleradiology company vRad, read AuntMinnieEurope.com's 9 July article and recognized the urgent need for ultrasound capabilities at the Ohmatdyt. He assisted with the logistics of the delivery process for the Butterfly devices.
Dr. Uliana Pidvalna, associate professor in the department of normal anatomy at Danylo Halytsky at Lviv National Medical University, and musculoskeletal radiologist Dr. Volker Lapczynski from Unilabs in Oslo, Norway, played a key role in establishing the partnership between vRad/FRI and MedGlobal Ukraine. Earlier this month, Sokol attended the MedGlobal annual congress in Chicago and met with Maihutiak plus many other Ukrainian physicians.
""As a result of this conference, we will be working with some Ukrainian intensive care specialists and others to provide frontline point-of-care ultrasound to help aid in the triage and care of soldiers and victims in Ukraine,"" he noted.
In his Facebook post, Rebenkov thanked MedGlobal and FRI -- particularly Davis, Sokol, and Maihutiak and their teams – for their support. ""This project would not have been possible without you. We deeply appreciate your efforts in organizing, transporting, and personally delivering this vital equipment to Kyiv during the International Healthcare Summit held at Shupyk National Healthcare University of Ukraine on 15-17 October.""
Rebenkov also paid gratitude to the radiology community, which has actively supported the staff at the Ohmatdyt since the missile attack carried out by Russia.
""Your solidarity and contributions have been invaluable during this challenging time, helping us restore operations and continue providing critical care to our patients,"" he noted. ""Your contributions not only help us continue providing high-quality medical care but also greatly expand our capabilities in diagnosing and treating children with severe conditions. You are helping save lives and giving hope to those who need it most!""",0.9500025510787964,624,1.5365976095199585

Another year at UEGW with Norgine and we stepped up once again. From Norgine’s strapline, Fluid Thinking, we created a flowing, water-themed stand. Product presentations were displayed on screens standing in pools of water linked together with a channel.

"The federal government is not adequately prepared to deal with the potential consequences of a large-scale biological attack on the U.S., including the massive decontamination effort that would be required, warns a report by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Biosecurity. A major release of a biological warfare agent could potentially result in hundreds of thousands of illnesses and deaths and cost trillions of dollars to clean up, the study notes. Contaminated areas might include buildings, streets, parks, and vehicles, which would probably all need to be decontaminated before an affected city could be inhabited again. ""Given the U.S. experience with the 2001 anthrax attacks, it is possible that a city might be uninhabitable for an extensive period of time following a large biological attack,"" the report says. Federal roles and responsibilities for decontamination research and response are not clearly spelled out, often overlap, and are generally underfunded, according to the analysis. In addition, the various federal agencies have too few personnel trained in decontamination.",0.972690761089325,213,2.8155412673950195
"Let’s set the stage:
You have the honored and vital role of being a member of a hiring committee. Your task is to find someone who will lead your nonprofit to the next level of success. This is exciting and a bit overwhelming, but you know you have 4 other people working alongside you on the committee to make the best decision possible.
You are anticipating healthy interaction with the committee members as you zero in on the best candidate. There is no thought of significant conflict or ongoing frustration. You are predicting that everyone will move in a unified manner to achieve the goal of hiring an impressive leader.
While this flawless dream has a small possibility of coming to fruition, our experience as a 48-year-old search firm with lots of experience with hiring committees is that this dream will start to fray within the first few weeks. Take heart, some righting of expectations and some predetermined ground rules can go a long way to making your team effective – and enjoyable.
What Went Wrong with the Hiring Committee?
Team conflict may blindside you. After all, there are so many reasons why you should be a highly successful team.
- Everyone on the committee has the best interests of the nonprofit in mind.
- Everyone is a professional and knows how to make excellent decisions.
- Everyone is nice enough and seemingly easy to get along with.
You have never had to work as a unified team to achieve an end result – and that’s the clincher.
Working with other people, no matter how great they are, is challenging. This article provides guidance to help you avoid the biggest pitfalls.
Your Committee Must Know the End Goal
You may have a general idea of your end goal but is it crystal clear to everyone on the team? For a hiring committee, your end goal is more than hiring someone, you want to hire the right someone. To know what the ideal person looks like there needs to be some discussion. It is possible that each person on the committee has a different picture in mind.
A discussion about the ideal candidate should involve framing up the must-have qualifications versus the nice-to-have qualification. It is also vital to know what senior leadership and the board of directors are looking for in an ideal candidate. This information will help form the correct target to aim for.
Apart from this discussion each of the committee members may have a different end goal in mind and this is sure to cause frustration.
Commit the Necessary Time
Once you establish what qualifications you are looking for, it can take some time to find the right person. Even when you have an outside search firm helping with the time-consuming sourcing and vetting, the interview process can be lengthy. There must be enough availability in each person’s schedule to accommodate interviews. Take into consideration that you are trying to align several calendars to make these interviews happen.
In addition to the interviews, there will be regular check-in meetings and debriefs to discuss the current candidates. This is not a process you want to repeat, so it is critical that you take the time to do it right the first time.
Be Dedicated to Moving the Process Along
Speaking of time, the best searches move at a steady pace. The reality is that candidates who get hung up in a long hiring process will lose interest or will get another job offer. (You can read more about that here.) The committee’s ability to communicate and make decisions effectively will greatly impact the success of the search.
Holding interviews, providing feedback and determining next steps must be done in a timely manner. This may seem like a reasonable request but it’s something each committee member must understand and agree to. Many times, a hiring committee is made up of people with full-time jobs apart from the nonprofit. That means they need to carve out the necessary time to move the hiring process along in addition to attending to their other professional responsibilities.
Communicate Within the Committee and Beyond
Another ground rule that should be determined at the beginning of the search is communication expectations. This can be broken down into two parts.
- Committee members must share any new information with the search committee and the other major stakeholders. If something significant changes, the key players all need to be aware and be on the same page.
- Committee members must be committed to communicating regularly and in a short amount of time. This one is tied to the need to move the process along. Sending out and replying to communication in a timely manner is the only way to keep the entire committee moving forward together.
Other Considerations for Committee Dynamics
There may be other ground rules that you need to establish when working with a team. You can find abundant research on team development. One popular concept is from Bruce Tuckman. According to Bruce Tuckman (1965), there are four key stages in a group’s development. Forming, storming, norming and performing. (Adjourning was added later). All teams must go through phases where they get to know each other and get used to working with each other by testing out the rules of the group. His work can shed additional light on the development of a team.
How to Achieve Committee Alignment
Quite often it is nice to have an outside third party to help navigate these ground rules and the discussions around them. This is a service Centennial provides to our clients who have partnered with us for an executive search. Our goal is to see both the candidate and client be successful long-term and that can only happen when the hiring committee is aligned with what they are seeking.
Partnering with a search firm can give you the neutral voice needed to help galvanize a team. The Centennial team would love to come alongside of you to find the best person for your leadership role. Connect with us about how we can help.",0.9598996043205261,1195,1.1369496583938599
"You know it’s going to be an evening of sad songs when the first words out of the artists’ mouth, even before “hello,” are “Hang Me, Hang me/I’ll be dead and gone.”
That is how Saskatchewan-born, Canadian singer-songwriter Zackary Lucky greeted the audience at the Avalon Theare’s Stoltz Listening Room Thursday night. But Lucky’s penchant for sad songs was a stark contrast with his charming and friendly stage presence.
Lucky’s songs are not complicated; they are straight-forward, powerful depictions of his life, a life lived primarily on the road. Many, if not most, of the songs he shared with the appreciative audience at Stolz were about the ups and downs – mostly the downs – of being away from home. As he sang in Stoned, one of the standout songs in a strong set, “Leaving comes easy to someone like me/not that I want to/just comes naturally. The hotels on the side of the road/the highway sets me free.” Finding himself caught between the call of the road and a more settled life and home, Lucky sings, in the plaintive Wild Rose County, “In Wild Rose county/I hear your voice on the phone/saying you missed me/and were tired of being alone/But it ain’t easy/living out here on my own/stuck in Wild Rose county/with no way to go home.”
Lucky’s voice is perfect for these songs – full and rich, with just a touch of honey. He is not shy about revealing his influences, sharing two Townes Van Zandt covers (as if Lucky’s own songs were not sad enough!), name dropping Guy Clark and Hayes Carll, and preforming songs written by fellow Canadians (including the great Water in the Fuel by Fred Eaglesmith). Van Zandt is most direct, if inexact, influence. Imagine Van Zant without the omnipresent sense of existential dread and you will have a good approximation of Lucky’s songwriting.
There is a palpable, and lovely, sense of place to Lucky’s songs. He is from Saskatchewan like Bob Seeger is from Michigan, like Lucinda Willaims is from Louisiana, and like Bruce Springsteen is from the Jersey Shore. It shapes every aspect of his work. It is hard to imagine two places more different than the landlocked prairies of Saskatchewan and the Chesapeake Bay-focused town of Easton. What they have in common, Lucky made clear, are the challenges of finding happiness amid difficulty and staying true to oneself.
Lucky was accompanied by Miles Zurawell on the dobro, a wood-bodied guitar with a metal resonator cone rather than the more traditional open sound hole of an acoustic guitar. The dobro’s sound is strange; not “strange” as in “bad,” but rather “strange” as in “unfamiliar.” It has a distinctive, ethereal quality, and is typically used quite sparingly. With just Lucky and Zurawell on stage, the dobro was front and center, with Zurawell coxing sounds from it that were beautiful and haunting at the same time. Zurawell’s turn in the spotlight was a highlight of the concert. He shared an instrumental from his own recent album – Elk River Blues, an old West Virginia fiddle tune by Ernie Carpenter reworked for the dobro. With no need for words, Zurawell captured the sadness and sorrow behind Carpenter’s song, which was inspired by the drowning of his ancestral homelands along the Elk River by a dam built by the Army Corps of Engineers.
Lucky’s show in Easton came toward the end of a 35-date, coast-to-coast tour, which saw him playing in many places he had never visited before. Not only was this his first time in Easton, but Lucky had also never been to Maryland before. You can almost see the gears turning in his head as he begins to process all that he has seen and learned on this tour and to translate those experiences into songs. I can’t wait to hear them.",0.9784177541732788,901,1.0456340312957764

The CerviFit was proven not only in an internal 44-patient study, but by an independent Air Force study which was published in the Military Medicine Journal.
CerviFit® is a patented revolutionary device designed specifically for neck strengthening and rehabilitation. In a recently published independent United States Air Force study, male F35 pilots from Eglin AFB (training with the CerviFit) demonstrated a significant increase of 55.7% in Cervical Endurance Hold (CEH) while F-16 pilots from Luke AFB utilizing the Ringside device exhibited a 34.5% increase.

Facts of Active-Duty Injuries
According to health.mil the official website of the military health system, ""Department of Defense active duty service members require medical treatment for injuries almost 5 million times each year (for around 1.5 million individual injuries). Injuries cost millions of lost duty and training days, and billions of dollars each year."" ¹
MSK (Musculo-Skeletal) specifically neck/back account for the highest number of injuries affecting you as an active service person.
- Injuries are the leading reason for military medical visits across Services.
- DOD Active-duty Service members require medical treatment for injuries almost 5 million times each year (for around 1.5 million individual injuries).
- There are 2 to 4 times more medical visits for injuries as the next most common reason which is behavioral and mental health.
- Injuries degrade force readiness through millions of lost duty and training days and billions of dollars annually.
- Majority (>2/3) of military injuries are musculoskeletal (MSK) cumulative mictrotraumatic (overuse) injuries.
What is a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN)?
A letter of medical necessity is a document written by a healthcare provider to justify a specific treatment, device, or service for a patient. It explains why the prescribed intervention is essential for the patient’s health, detailing the diagnosis, treatment plan, and expected health benefits. Often required by insurance companies to approve coverage, this letter provides evidence that the requested service or product is medically necessary for the patient’s recovery or quality of life. It supports claims for treatments that might otherwise be considered elective or non-essential by insurers.
And Readiness As the Air Force study illustrates, incorporating CerviFit into a military training program can lead to enhanced physical readiness. A well-strengthened neck improves posture, balance, and overall body mechanics. This translates to better performance in physically demanding tasks, whether it’s maneuvering through challenging terrains or executing tactical drills.
The Long-Term Benefits
Investing time in neck strengthening with tools like CerviFit not only enhances immediate performance but also contributes to long-term health. Reducing the risk of neck injuries can decrease downtime, ensuring that soldiers remain operational and ready for duty. Additionally, a strong neck supports overall spinal health, which is crucial for maintaining agility and flexibility in various military scenarios.
Neck strengthening is an essential aspect of physical training for active military personnel. The CerviFit offers a specialized, effective means to develop neck strength, reduce injury risks, and enhance overall performance. By prioritizing neck health, military members can improve their resilience and readiness, ultimately supporting their mission and well-being in demanding environments. Investing in neck strengthening today can lead to a more capable and durable military force tomorrow.

While CerviFit has been paid for by Tri-care in the past, ultimately, any reimbursement remains up to the discretion of the case manager or adjuster. Any reimbursement should follow the steps on the tri-care page.
How is CerviFit different from typical neck strengthening products?
Unlike traditional neck strengthening products available to the consumer, CerviFit began as a physician prescribed home therapy program in lieu of traditional out-patient Physical Therapy. Insurance paid thousands on behalf of their patient's for the CerviFit prior to us making it available to the general public.
Has there been any scientific research on the CerviFit home therapy system?

Whether you’re a fashion aficionado or someone looking to add a touch of tradition to your wardrobe, this guide will provide you with everything you need to know about Fair Isle sweaters, from their history to how to wear and care for them.
What is a Fair Isle Sweater?
Definition and Origin
A Fair Isle sweater is a type of knitted garment characterized by its use of traditional patterns and colors. The name “Fair Isle” comes from the Fair Isle, one of the Shetland Islands in Scotland, where this distinctive style of knitting originated. These sweaters are known for their use of multiple colors in geometric patterns, often incorporating motifs like snowflakes, diamonds, and bands.
- Color Patterns: Fair Isle sweaters are known for their vibrant, multi-colored designs. The patterns are typically created using a technique called stranded colorwork, where different colors of yarn are used to create intricate designs.
- Warmth and Comfort: Made from wool or wool-blend yarns, Fair Isle sweaters are incredibly warm and soft, making them perfect for cold weather.
- Traditional Motifs: Common motifs include geometric shapes, snowflakes, and nature-inspired designs, reflecting the rich heritage of the Shetland Islands.
The History of Fair Isle Sweaters
Origins and Development
The history of Fair Isle sweaters dates back to the early 20th century. The traditional patterns were inspired by the natural surroundings of the Shetland Islands, where local knitters used the resources available to create practical and beautiful garments.
In the 1920s, the Isle sweater gained popularity beyond its local roots when British aristocrats and celebrities began to wear them. The sweater’s charm was further cemented in the 1950s and 60s when it became a symbol of classic British style.
Fair Isle knitting represents a fusion of practicality and artistry. The intricate designs were originally used to keep fishermen warm during harsh weather conditions. Over time, these sweaters have become a symbol of British craftsmanship and heritage, celebrated for their intricate beauty and cultural significance.
How to Wear a Fair Isle Sweater
- Casual Look: Pair a Fair Isle sweater with jeans and boots for a relaxed, everyday look. The sweater’s patterns add a touch of visual interest to a simple outfit.
- Layering: Fair Isle sweaters work well as layering pieces. Throw a tailored coat or jacket over your sweater to stay warm and stylish.
- Accessorize: Complement your Fair Isle sweater with accessories like scarves or hats in coordinating colors. This can help balance the vibrant patterns and add a polished touch to your outfit.
Fair Isle sweaters are versatile enough to be worn for various occasions:
- Casual Outings: Ideal for weekend activities, casual meet-ups, and holiday gatherings.
- Outdoor Activities: Perfect for outdoor adventures like hiking or skiing, thanks to their warmth and durability.
- Festive Events: Their traditional patterns make them a popular choice for festive occasions and holiday celebrations.
Caring for Your Isle Sweater
- Hand Wash: To maintain the quality and shape of your Fair Isle sweater, hand wash it in cold water using a gentle wool detergent. Avoid wringing or twisting the sweater to prevent stretching.
- Dry Flat: Lay the sweater flat on a clean towel to dry. Avoid hanging it, as this can cause the sweater to lose its shape.
- Keep It Cool and Dry: Store your Fair Isle sweater in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture damage and mold growth.
- Avoid Moths: Use moth repellents or cedar blocks to protect the wool from moths and pests.

"Kardamyla - Castle of Gria
Information | ||
Location: Northeastern Chios | Type: Hiking on mountain footpath | Degree of difficulty: 1 - Easy with steep incline |
Length of route: 1.360 m. | Time: About 45 min. | Drinking water along the way: No |
Max. / Min. elevation: 449 m / 280 m | Difference in elevation: 169 m. | Suggested starting point: Junction of the stone-paved road to Pityos |
Natural environment: Koulalas Valley, olive trees and almond pears, Mt. Gria, scrub vegetation where spurge is the predominant species and wild
orchids are present.
Kardamyla - Castle of Gria
We turn off the road running between Chios Town and Kardamyla onto the road leading to Pityos, and at a distance of one and a half km. from the intersection we see the sign marking the route.
After parking our vehicle, we continue on foot on the stone-paved footpath. The stone paving soon ends and the footpath continues unpaved.
About 300 m. further on, the footpath divides. Here the footpath on our right leads to the summit of the mountain and the Castle of Gria, and the footpath on our left leads to the Koulalas area, with the broad old Genoese well (pigada Koulala) and the abandoned farmhouse. The hiker is advised to continue on up to the summit and visit Koulalas Valley on the way back.
The trek is relatively difficult, due to the rocky ground and steep inclines. Around us the landscape is dry and rocky and the soil mainly clayey.
We continue to ascend, following the twists and turns of the footpath. Behind us lies Koulalas Valley and in front of us looms massive Mt. Gria.
In certain places up near the fortress we can see the remains of the bulwarks, the defense walls built by the volunteers of the Kardamyla Corps to ward off the Turkish army during the battles for the island’s independence in 1912.
Just before we reach the top of the hill, when we reach a resting area with a gazebo and benches we are rewarded with a panoramic view. Great care is needed because of the steep cliff. Spread out below us are Kardamyla, the plain,the harbour, the islets of Oinousses and Delfini and the coast of Asia Minor opposite. On the next summit, a few meters ahead, stands the Fortress of Gria.
A few minutes’ hike takes us to the fortress. We enter its enclosure through a gap where the wall has crumbled and enjoy the panoramic view of the settlements of Ano Kardamyla, Spilia and Marmaros.
The descent is easier. In a shorter time than it took us to climb up, we reach the foot of the mountain and either continue on the same route or turn to our right and wind up in the Koulalas area, with the large, well-built old Genoese well. From there, on the unpaved road we reach the point where we began our uphill trek.
Castle of Gria: A medieval defense fortifi-cation, which served as the citadel of Kardamyla. Tradition has it that it owes its name to an old lady (“gria” in Greek) who climbed up from Kardamyla over the steep rocks, in order to save herself from pirates. Still extant in the fortress are two towers connected by a wall. The eastern tower is semi-circular backed by the wall, and the western tower is round. This whole complex stands on the south side of the flat top of the mountain. There is a sheer dropoff on all the other sides, which obviated the need to construct a defense wall.
Tradition has it that the western tower communicated with the well of Koulalas through a tunnel, which provided the people shut up in the fortress with water.
The well of Koulalas: Built of local stone, it dates back to the Genoese occupation (1346-1566). Stone steps curved in its walls lead to the bottom of the well. There are also bulwarks here. These are the fortified positions of the fighters of the Kardamyla Volunteer Corps during the battles for the liberation of Chios in 1912.
Alternative routes or means
Due to the morphology of the path, it is not possible to use another means, such as mountain biking, as there are points with stairs and sharp turns of the path. A short but worthwhile detour is the route to the Koulalas well.
Via Ferrata: Via Ferrata is the first iron climbing trail of its kind in Greece. Before we reach the cobblestones of the route, we follow a path that leads to the beginning of Via Ferrata.
NOTE: It is used by trained people who carry special equipment.",0.9364616274833679,1059,1.8017544746398926
"Early on in our headphone research we realized there was a need to develop a listening test method that allowed us to conduct more controlled double-blind listening tests on different headphones. This was necessary in order to remove tactile cues (headphone weight and clamping force), visual and psychological biases (e.g. headphone brand, price, celebrity endorsement,etc ) from listeners’ sound quality judgements of headphones. While these factors (apart from clamping force) don’t physically affect the sound of headphones, our previous research  into blind vs. sighted listening tests revealed their cognitive influence affects listeners’ loudspeaker preferences , often in adverse ways. In sighted tests, listeners were also less sensitive and discriminating compared to blind conditions when judging different loudspeakers including their interaction with different music selections and loudspeaker positions in the room. For that reason, consumers should be dubious of loudspeaker and headphone reviews that are based solely on sighted listening.
While blind loudspeakers listening tests are possible through the addition of an acoustically-transparent- visually-opaque-curtain, there is no simple way to hide the identity of a headphone when the listener is wearing it. In our first headphone listening tests, the experimenter positionally substituted the different headphones onto the listener’s head from behind so that the headphone could not be visually identified. However, after a couple of trials, listeners began to identify certain headphones simply by their weight and clamping force. One of the easiest headphones for listeners to identify was the Audeze LCD-2, which was considerably heavier (522 grams) and more uncomfortable than the other headphones. The test was essentially no longer blind.
To that end, a virtual headphone method was developed whereby listeners could A/B different models of headphones that were virtualized through a single pair of headphones (the replicator headphone). Details on the method and its validation were presented at the 51st Audio Engineering Society International Conference on Loudspeakers and Headphones  in Helsinki, Finland in 2013. A PDF of the slide presentation can be found here.
Headphone virtualization is done by measuring the frequency response of the different headphones at the DRP (eardrum reference point) using a G.R.A.S. 45 AG, and then equalizing the replicator headphone to match the measured responses of the real headphones. In this way, listeners can make instantaneous A/B comparisons between any number of virtualized headphones through the same headphone without the visual and tactile clues biasing their judgment. More details about the method are in the slides and AES preprint.
An important questions is: “How accurate are the virtual headphones compared to the actual headphones”? In terms of their linear acoustic performance they are quite similar. Fig. 2 compares the measured frequency response of the actual versus virtualized headphones. The agreement is quite good up to 8-10 kHz above which we didn’t aggressively equalize the headphones because of measurement errors and large variations related to headphone positioning both on the coupler and the listeners’ head.
More importantly, “Do the actual and virtual headphones sound similar”? To answer this question we performed a validation experiment where listeners evaluated 6 different headphone using both standard and virtual listening methods Listeners gave both preference and spectral balance ratings in both standard and virtual tests. For headphone preference ratings the correlation between standard and virtual test results was r = 0.85. A correlation of 1 would be perfect but 85% agreement is not bad, and hopefully more accurate than headphone ratings based on sighted evaluations.
The differences between virtual and standard test results we believe are in part due to nuisance variables that were not perfectly controlled across the two test methods. A significant nuisance variable would likely be headphone leakage that would affect the amount of bass heard depending on the fit of the headphone on the individual listener. This would have affected the results in the standard test but not the virtual one where we used an open-back headphone that largely eliminates leakage variations across listeners. Headphone weight and tactile cues were present in the standard test but not the virtual test, and this could in part explain the differences in results. If these two variables could be better controlled even higher accuracy can be achieved in virtual headphone listening.
Some additional benefits from virtual headphone testing were discovered besides eliminating sighted and psychological biases: the listening tests are faster, more efficient and more sensitive. When listeners can quickly switch and compare all of the headphones in a single trial, auditory memory is less of a factor, and they are better able to discriminate among the choices. Since this paper was written in 2013, we’ve improved the accuracy of the virtualization in part by developing a custom pinnae for our GRAS 45 CA that better simulates the leakage effects of headphones measured on real human subjects .
Finally, it’s important to acknowledge what the virtual headphone method doesn’t capture: 1) non-minimum phase effects (mostly occurring at higher frequencies) and 2) non-linear distortions that are level-dependent. The effect of these two variables on virtual headphone test method have been recently tested experimentally and will be the topic of a future blog posting. Stay tuned.

"STAGING YOUR BATHROOMS FOR
""SHOW AND SELL""
Focus your efforts on staging in strategic areas. Your bathroom is one of those. People will inspect bathrooms. They look under toilet seats and inside toilet boxes. Prospective buyers don’t want a public bathroom ""feel” about what will be their most private place. Here are a few tips to help you stage your bathrooms properly:
- Aim for a spa-like look and feel. Beautiful bathrooms are a big draw for buyers. Since you obviously can’t create a real spa at home, your best option is to make the best of what you already have. With a few changes here and there, you can give your bathrooms a spa-like look and feel that prospective buyers will love, so keep this in mind as you make the changes below.
- Give the bathroom a thorough cleaning. This should be obvious, but clean everything thoroughly, remove stains, and make sure everything is immaculately spotless. Clean water-stained shower doors with a lime-dissolving detergent. You can also hire a professional to refinish a stained bathtub. Cleaning might not be the most exciting task in the world, but it's very important to do, as this gives buyers the impression that your home is well-maintained.
- Ensure there are no cleaning products in sight. Yes, you need them to get that thoroughly clean look that will impress, but leaving buckets, mops, and supplies around gives your bathroom a janitorial closet feel that implies housework and maintenance, not the beautiful spa-like experience buyers want to imagine they can get from a bathroom. Remove other things like bathroom scales, spare toilet rolls, toilet brushes, wastepaper baskets, sponges, etc. Also stash all your personal items, like soaps, toothbrushes, cotton balls, etc., under the bathroom sink, where they're hidden away. Seeing your personal hygiene products can make buyers feel a little awkward, as if they are in your personal space.
- Hang fresh, luxurious towels and lay down bath mats. The addition of beautiful, soft towels can transform a bathroom in an instant. Thick, white, luxurious towels always workwell, but brightly colored towels are also in style these days. Get new ones if you can, as these look better than washed towels, and only use them as display props when prospective buyers are viewing. If you have sufficient counter space in your bathroom, you can create an even more luxurious feel by placing a neatly folded pile of two or three matching towels on the counter, beside the bath.
- Organize storage space. Buyers love plenty of storage space and they will open your bathroom cupboards to see how much is there. You want to create the impression that storage is plentiful, so ensure your cupboards aren't full and overflowing. About half-full, or up to two-thirds full, is a good look, and make sure everything inside is well organized. This applies to your counters, too. Clear off the counters and remove all your everyday toiletries and bathroom supplies. If you really don't have enough space for all your toiletries, put the excess in toiletry baskets and store them out of sight.
- Accessorize for a better look. Once your bathroom is free of clutter and your personal hygiene products, enhance the whole look with a few well-chosen accessories. Use items such as scented candles in varying heights, fragrant soaps, bath oils, natural loofahs, a basket of tightly rolled washcloths, or even a good book. Choose accessories in soft colors and keep things simple, so it doesn't create a cluttered look. Candles create a layer of warmth, elegance, luxury, and tranquility. If you've got the space, you can go one step further by putting in a stool or ottoman beside the bathtub. This is both functional and stylish, and will give your bathroom the ultimate private suite look.
- Add fresh flowers. Flowers and plants add a nice touch to any room and the same goes for bathrooms. Add color and texture to your bathrooms with your favorite flowers. It doesn't have to be a bouquet, especially if the bathroom is small. A single stem or a small planter will enliven the bathroom.
- Upgrade where necessary. Although you don't need to spend a lot of money to stage your bathroom, there might bethings that you might consider replacing. Small, inexpensive upgrades can have a big impact on the total look of your bathroom - repainting your walls, for instance. You can only pull off the ""spa look"" if the walls look good. If your bathroom is wallpapered, it's likely that the wallpaper is peeling - so remove it, and paint instead. Even if your walls are painted, you may want to consider repainting them to give a fresh new look. If you're going to paint or repaint, it's a wise choice to stick with neutral colors. They're more likely to appeal to more prospective buyers. Apart from painting, other bathroom upgrades that you can do without spending a fortune are replacing leaking and worn taps, installing new light fittings, and updating the cabinets. If your toilet is broken, badly stained, or outdated, you should consider replacing it. Buy a new shower curtain and tie it back with ribbons, or replace a shower screen that's badly stained or cracked. If your home is higher-priced, you may also consider other more substantial upgrades, like changing tiles to preserve that luxury- bathroom feel buyers will want to find in a home.",0.9530349969863892,1159,1.369060754776001
"My intensity is my super power. Maybe it’s yours?
I see you…
Painting the world in bold colors when everyone else paints in pastels. You feel things deeper than most, absorbing the energy of everything around you. Sounds are loud, colors are bright, and everything seems like too much. Sometimes you may even wonder if you are too much.
I’ve been there. I understand what it means to live from a place of extreme intensity. Most of my life, I’ve been told I’m “too intense, too much, too…everything.” I’ve struggled to manage my intense nature, been caught in the throes of doubt, guilt, and shame, explored dark shadows of my inner world.
There were many times I wanted to change my nature, not be the intense person that I am. I tried to hide my gifts, walk away from my creative self, be someone different.
Maybe you’ve done the same thing.
But here’s the thing – you can’t walk away from you. And why would you want to?
Our intense nature fuels our creative passions, allowing for greater inspiration, deeper connection, and more meaningful transformation.
Sure, living an authentic life isn’t easy. Embracing my intense nature as a strength was something I had to learn. But once that happens, once you redefine your normal and live in congruence with the fire and passion of your intensities, you can align with your purpose and create more meaning for yourself and the planet.
My story. . .
As a young child, I was intense and creative. I spent my days in my head, conjuring up stories filled with heroes and villains. I wondered about the world, people, and life. Things haven’t changed too much! I still spend much of my day wondering. As a survivor of abuse and trauma, I know firsthand how stories can transform lives. Other people’s stories gave me hope and understanding when I had none. And now, my words have the capacity to do the same for others. As a professional storyteller, I use my imagination to bring stories to life in engaging, informative, and entertaining ways. Whether it’s tackling the mental health needs of children and adults or delving into the world of myth, I use my words to guide others to recognize the power of their origin stories.
My writing career officially started in 2010, when my first book, Emotional Intensity in Gifted Students, was published. Born from a parenting workshop I’d taught for over ten years, the book blended my training as an educational psychologist with my personal experiences dealing with emotional intensity. Through this book, I wanted to help parents better understand what it means to live as an intense human.
Christine Fonseca’s ability to put things into a perspective that anyone can understand is AMAZING!
…a great voice for teen girls.
As the parent of two gifted children, the spouse of a gifted husband, and a gifted adult, I live with intensity every moment of every day. Over the years, I’ve come to understand that the intense behaviors that so often threw us off-balance were the very same passionate emotions that enable many of our greatest joys. Achieving equilibrium wasn’t about diminishing the intensity of the moments, but about changing our mindset about those moments and building stronger coping strategies for life’s curveballs.
Emotional Intensity was an instant success, resonating with parents who had experienced similar feelings to me. The book started my life as an author. As parents and educators began to reach out and ask me to teach the concepts in the book, my speaking and consulting business began. I started speaking at state and local conferences and coaching others to harness the power of their intensity. I also wrote more books – many more books.
In 2017, I explored additional ways I could help highly creative and intense adults and children. I started a small online coaching practice, developed courses that could blend my writing side with my psychology side, and grew my speaking events. Today, I think of myself as a storyteller, a thinker, and a changemaker. I am committed to using my training and experiences to show others how to harness their creative energy, explore truth, and embrace their intensities. My goal is to experience inspiration, connection, and transformation in my own life and help others do the same.

"Before beginning any property transaction, whether in the UK or overseas, it’s vital that you carry out as much research as possible, and also that you understand the scale of the financial commitment you’ll be entering into.
While the internet is a good starting point for gathering information, you should also plan to make at least one visit to the region you’re considering; otherwise, you run the risk of making an ill-informed decision about a property, location or price.
It’s a good idea to try and talk to other overseas buyers about their experience of purchasing property in your chosen country. You should also consider renting an apartment or house in the area for a month or two, both to acquire local knowledge about the region but also to gain some personal insight about whether the location is exactly right for you.
We all have fantasies of owning a beautiful holiday home, of relaxing by our own pool and enjoying a sun-drenched tranquil setting. However, you can only realise these dreams if you ask some sensible questions before you buy.
You should always remember that you’re purchasing only what is written in your contract. You can't base the value of your property on any projected future growth or on anything else that is currently intangible.
Laws regarding the ownership of property by non-nationals or non-residents vary from country to country: it’s therefore essential that you have all the relevant information before committing yourself to an expensive purchase. You need to know your rights about property ownership as well as understand related issues such as taxes and fees for registration. For example, while some countries don’t have stamp duty fees, many do have an equivalent cost.
You should agree a flat fee with your lawyer at the outset, as some may try to bill you for extra costs if the purchase is delayed for any reason. Try and talk to several lawyers in the country of your choice and make sure you get several quotes for comparison. Check whether there are any property lawyers in the UK who specialise in transactions in the country of your choice – and if you do choose to use the services of a UK-based lawyer, make sure they are registered with the Law Society (www.lawsociety.org.uk).
Once you’ve retained the services of a lawyer, make sure that the contract of sale conforms to the civil laws of the country where the property is located. The laws of some countries state that there must be a dual contract of sale, which means that the contract must be written both in English and in the native language of that country.
Before the purchase goes ahead, your lawyer should investigate whether there are any restrictions imposed which might restrict your ability to sell the property at a later date. They should also check that there are no hidden taxes or fees involved in the purchase, that the property has a clean title and that it is free from any debts or disputes. In some countries, property ownership may be shared by several members of the same family; your lawyer must therefore ensure that all the owners have signed the contract allowing the sale to proceed.
And finally, before handing over your contract or any other legal documents, you should always make sure that you have a copy for your own records, and that you have a receipt from your lawyer or the seller’s lawyer, confirming that they are in possession of your original documents
Property purchases are usually priced in the local currency, which means that you may need to organise a transfer of the equivalent value in sterling. Before transferring any money, check the exchange rate on the day, and remember that exchange rates listed on any currency converter will not include bank charges or broker fees. It's advisable, therefore, to base your calculations on a value 3-4 points lower than the figure displayed. For example, where a conversion rate is 1.80, your calculation should be based on a rate of 1.75 – 1.76.
If you are transferring money to an estate agent, ask to be provided with a bank exchange rate receipt showing the sterling amount exchanged along with the rate and amount received. Alternatively, you could use a money exchange company in the UK from whom you would purchase the exact amount in your required currency. Most money exchange companies will then forward your payment onto its destination.
If you need to decorate or furnish your property, it is a good idea to visit as many local suppliers as possible in order to get some prices for comparison. If you have purchased a property in a tourist resort, prices of goods will be higher and you may want to travel to the nearest city or town where prices may be cheaper.
While most off-plan properties have an optional furniture package, it is still a good idea to obtain independent quotes. This will allow you to weigh up the cost and convenience of having the building developer furnish your property for you against the cheaper option of sourcing furniture yourself.
When buying a property, either the UK or overseas, it is essential that you understand that the value of your investment can go down as well as up. Property prices can remain stagnant for years, shoot up to unsustainable levels or devalue dramatically. So if you do see some capital appreciation, you should not assume that this trend will continue. The key to any successful investment is judging when to buy and sell.",0.9645483493804932,1081,1.4321681261062622
"Climate change and the need to take action to adapt our economic system towards renewable energies is the dominating theme of this decade and beyond. Climate change and the energy transition pose important challenges for many firms, for entire economic sectors, and for our economies as a whole. There is an urgent need for risk quantification to underpin action in the public and private sectors. This is crucial to ensure adequate pricing of assets early on, to avoid climate change or transition-induced financial disruption, and to inform policy makers of the optimal path to choose for climate transition.

"THE WHITE HOUSE
Office of the Press Secretary
(Camp David, Maryland)
Immediate Release December 31, 2000
STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT
The United States is today signing the 1998 Rome Treaty on the
International Criminal Court. In taking this action, we join more than 130
other countries that have signed by the December 31, 2000 deadline
established in the Treaty. We do so to reaffirm our strong support for
international accountability and for bringing to justice perpetrators of
genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. We do so as well
because we wish to remain engaged in making the ICC an instrument of
impartial and effective justice in the years to come.
The United States has a long history of commitment to the principle of
accountability, from our involvement in the Nuremberg tribunals that
brought Nazi war criminals to justice, to our leadership in the effort to
establish the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia
and Rwanda. Our action today sustains that tradition of moral leadership.
Under the Rome Treaty, the International Criminal Court (ICC) will
come into being with the ratification of 60 governments, and will have
jurisdiction over the most heinous abuses that result from international
conflict, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The
Treaty requires that the ICC not supercede or interfere with functioning
national judicial systems; that is, the ICC Prosecutor is authorized to
take action against a suspect only if the country of nationality is
unwilling or unable to investigate allegations of egregious crimes by their
national. The U.S. delegation to the Rome Conference worked hard to
achieve these limitations, which we believe are essential to the
international credibility and success of the ICC.
In signing, however, we are not abandoning our concerns about
significant flaws in the Treaty. In particular, we are concerned that when
the Court comes into existence, it will not only exercise authority over
personnel of states that have ratified the Treaty, but also claim
jurisdiction over personnel of states that have not. With signature,
however, we will be in a position to influence the evolution of the Court.
Without signature, we will not.
Signature will enhance our ability to further protect U.S. officials
from unfounded charges and to achieve the human rights and accountability
objectives of the ICC. In fact, in negotiations following the Rome
Conference, we have worked effectively to develop procedures that limit the
likelihood of politicized prosecutions. For example, U.S. civilian and
military negotiators helped to ensure greater precision in the definitions
of crimes within the Court?s jurisdiction.
But more must be done. Court jurisdiction over U.S. personnel should
come only with U.S. ratification of the Treaty. The United States should
have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the Court, over
time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction. Given these
concerns, I will not, and do not recommend that my successor submit the
Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until our fundamental concerns
Nonetheless, signature is the right action to take at this point. I
believe that a properly constituted and structured International Criminal
Court would make a profound contribution in deterring egregious human
rights abuses worldwide, and that signature increases the chances for
productive discussions with other governments to advance these goals in the
months and years ahead.",0.9405791163444519,723,2.108240842819214

"A slot is a thin opening or groove, used to insert something such as a card or a letter. A slot can also refer to a specific feature within an object such as the slot on a television or the slot on a door handle. Slot is also a gaming term used to describe the mechanism by which a casino game pays out winning combinations.
Slot machines are the loudest, brightest, and most exciting games on a casino floor. They offer the biggest jackpots, but can also give you a big loss if you’re not careful. They have a reputation for being easy to learn and play, but the truth is that there is a lot of skill involved in maximizing your chances of winning.
In addition to the regular symbols, modern slot games often have bonus features, like wilds, scatters, re-spins, sticky wilds, and even free spins. These features can make a game more fun and rewarding, but you should always check the pay table for rules on how to trigger them. Pay tables also display the payout amounts for different combinations of symbols, as well as any caps a casino might place on top jackpots.
It’s important to know how many coins or tokens you’re going to play per spin, because if you play too few, your odds of winning will be low. Similarly, you should consider how much time and money you have available to spend on slot gaming. The best way to do this is by setting a budget or bankroll, which should be an amount you’re willing to lose.
Once upon a time, players dropped coins into slots and used paper bills to activate them for each spin. Today, casino gamblers use advance deposits and credits for play. In addition, slot machines have a wide range of denominations, making them accessible to players with any budget.
Table games generally have better odds than slots, but the difference is negligible in most cases. Unless you’re playing one of the few games that can blow a casino’s payout percentage out of the water, the odds of winning are virtually identical across all types of slot machines.
Slot machines are the most popular casino games for a reason: they’re exciting, simple to understand, and can yield massive jackpots. In fact, they make up the largest percentage of all casino floor space. But how do they earn so much revenue? The answer lies in their unique mechanics.
When choosing a slot machine, consider the volatility of the game and whether it matches your preferences. If you prefer consistent smaller wins, opt for a lower-volatility slot. Higher-volatility slots offer less frequent but larger winnings. If you’re hoping to hit a big jackpot, however, you’ll want to go with a high-volatility slot that can deliver a huge prize. But be warned: these games tend to have higher house edges than low-volatility slots. This means that you’ll need to be more patient if you want to win big.",0.9531527757644653,618,1.9268003702163696
"Search engine optimization (SEO) is defined as the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine's ""natural"" or un-paid (""organic"") search results. A variety of methods can increase the prominence of a webpage within the search results but as search engine providers are constantly tweaking their indexing algorithm website owners should review the SEO techniques they utilize for their own site.
Key Factors that Improve SEO Ranking
Following are some of the key optimization parameters that the author believes will contribute to the improved SEO Ranking:
- Have unique page titles for each of the pages, and ensure this by having tag be placed within the tag of the HTML document - Result: Page title content are displayed in Search result
- Make use of the Meta Description, Key words tags - Google may choose to use a relevant section of your page's visible text if it does a good job of matching up with a user's query. Adding description Meta tags to each of your pages is always a good practice in case Google cannot find a good selection of text to use in the snippet for your pages in the search result
- URL Structure / Simple-to-understand URLS (Friendly URLs) - This will lead to better crawling of the pages by search engines
- Provide a HTML sitemap for the site, XML sitemap for search engine - See Sitemaps.org for specifications XML sitemaps. Most CMSs also now provide these feature in their software or through a module/plugin/extension.
- Bounce Rate - If Google sees that nobody hangs out for more than few seconds in your site, this will impact SEO ranking over a period of time.
- Outbound Links - Make sure the websites that you link are 100% relevant to your business & industry. If it is not relevant over a period of time, it will impact the SEO rankings.
- Great Content - One of the other most important influencing factor more than all of the above is to ensure that site has compelling and useful content
If you are lost on how best to provide and maintain these SEO techniques for your site, most of the above activities can be done by SEO agencies that are in the business of reviewing your site and providing you with the right content, search keywords and Friendly URLs. Also, some of the CMS products have SEO-Checklist add-ons in-place to ensure that page title, Meta-description, keywords attributes are tagged based on the content, and also in some cases they also provide statistics like which search engines/bots have crawled the site/pages.
Beyond the 7 Key Factors of SEO Ranking
One of the frustrating aspects of SEO is that you sometimes need to ""get into the weeds"" and explore optimizing your site beyond the the basic SEO checklists. There are some of site architecture and technical implementation factors that might influence or impact SEO optimization. For example you'll also want to consider and evaluate:
- Page size
- Page load time
There is some debate of whether the length of the page itself is a factor for SEO (short form vs long form), but the smaller the file size of the page and the shorter the page load time the better your site may be in the rankings.
If you want to get even deeper into SEO then take a look at the code behind the pages produced for your site. For example, there are various discussions and points of view regarding the use of DIV vs. TABLE tags to build the HTML pages, and their effect on SEO. Some says usage of TABLE badly effect SEO while some say it does not have any major effect on SEO ranking.
In summary what we can conclude from these discussions are:
- Search engines really do no care about the HTML code (as long as syntax is correct), and check whether pages have been developed using DIV vs. TABLE
- Use what is convenient to you, obviously for tabular data representation TABLE is more preferred option and DIV provide more easy control over the layout design
- There is one caveat for using TABLE: Nested tables do result in increase of the page size and in turn result in increase of page load time, which might affect the SEO ranking
Couple of years back Google announced PageSpeed as one of the factors for ranking in Google search. PageSpeed is an open-source project started at Google to help developers optimize their web pages by applying web performance best practices.
Internally we have been using this tool extensively along with YSlow to monitor the page load and optimize the page size and load time. A few things we have started doing to optimize the page size other than DIV or TABLE are:
- Combine multiple CSS and JS files to one
- Minify CSS and JS files
- Enable GZIP compression on CSS and JS files
Optimizing your site for better search engine rankings can be as simple as following the seven key factors we provided in this article. However, as we've discussed in this article there is room for discussion and improvement of what factors you consider important for improving your SEO rankings. Below are some additional sources of the useful information the author has found regarding SEO Ranking:

New Warning for Providers: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Issues New Guidance on Data Risks Associated with Websites and Portals
Shannon K. Cohall and Susan R. Huntington
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a bulletin (the Bulletin) highlighting the obligations of Health Insurance Portability and Account- ability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)–covered entities and their business associates (collectively, the Regulated Entities) when using online tracking technologies that collect and analyze information about users through websites, portals, or mobile applications. The Bulletin addresses potential impermissible disclosures of electronic protected health information (ePHI) by Regulated Entities to online tracking technology vendors and provides steps for protecting ePHI when using these technologies. This article summarizes the requirements of the Bulletin and provides practical recommendations to mitigate HIPAA exposures associated with the tracking features of websites and the like.
Online tracking technologies associated with websites and apps provide insightful information regarding the behaviors of users, including what content or features attract visitors and which pages they frequently browse. For website and app owners, these insights are used to enhance the website and app functionalities and design and to provide updates that enrich the user experience. These technologies may allow health care providers to offer more robust, remote, and interactive services to patients. For example, scheduling an appointment with a doctor, ordering online prescription refills, direct messaging, paying bills online, or receiving services through a telehealth visit are now all immensely simpler using an app or a website. The COVID-19 pandemic further empowered this necessary reliance on technology services in health care. However, even with all these benefits to health care access, online tracking technologies also open the door to data misuse through data breaches or identity theft through the software or application vendor.
Defining Tracking Technologies
The OCR released the Bulletin in response to the growing data privacy-related scrutiny of online tracking technologies. The OCR defines a tracking technology as a script or code on a website or an app used to gather information, including individually identifiable health information, about a user’s interaction with the website or app. Once the information is collected, it is analyzed by the web- site or mobile app owner or a third party to create insights about users’ online activities. All the collected information is generally ePHI and triggers HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification rules (collectively, HIPAA), which mandate that covered entities may not disclose ePHI to third parties unless such disclosure is made pursuant to an individual’s HIPAA-compliant authorization or a HIPAA exception (such as for treatment, payment, or health care operations).
The OCR additionally provides guidance for how tracking technologies may be used by Regulated Entities in three specific contexts:
(1) user-authenticated web pages,
(2) unauthenticated webpages, and
(3) mobile apps, each of which is described below.
A user-authenticated webpage is one that requires a user to log in to obtain access. Common examples of user-authenticated webpages include patient portals and telehealth platforms. Tracking technologies on user-authenticated webpages generally have access to ePHI, including an individual’s internet protocol (IP) address, medical record number, home and/or email address, dates of appointments, and even the individual’s diagnosis and treatment, prescription, billing, and other sensitive information. Thus, the OCR mandates that Regulated Entities must ensure that any user-authenticated webpages that include tracking technologies only use and disclose ePHI in compliance with HIPAA and enter into a business associate agreement (BAA) with each tracking technology vendor.
In contrast, an unauthenticated webpage is one that does not require a user to log in to obtain access. An example of such a webpage includes a “brochure type” webpage, where, for example, an individual can view general, public-facing information or news about a Regulated Entity. Tracking technologies used on unauthenticated webpages generally do not have access to individuals’ ePHI and thus are not typically regulated by HIPAA. That said, the OCR provides two scenarios involving unauthenticated webpages that would, in fact, make the webpages subject to HIPAA:
Scenario No. 1: A Regulated Entity’s login or registration page (which may be the website homepage) in which the individual enters credential information (e.g., name, email address) on that page. Such information is ePHI and therefore protected by HIPAA.
Scenario No. 2: A webpage that addresses specific symptoms or health conditions or that permits individuals to search for doctors or schedule appointments without entering credentials. In this instance, the tracking technologies could collect an individual’s email and/or IP address. Here, the Regulated Entity is disclosing ePHI to the tracking vendor, and that information is protected by HIPAA.
Health care mobile apps have proliferated in recent years and are commonly offered by technology companies, software providers, and others. When mobile apps are developed or offered by Regulated Entities, though, the Regulated Entities must ensure the mobile apps comply with HIPAA. Many of these mobile apps use tracking technologies that collect user information, including fingerprints, network location, geolocation, and device ID, all of which is ePHI. Disclosure to the mobile app or any other third-party vendor must comply with HIPAA, including the need for a BAA. However, the OCR states that HIPAA does not apply to mobile apps that are not developed or offered by or on behalf of Regulated Entities (such as a general website search engine available to the public). These apps may be subject to other laws, like the Federal Trade Commission’s Health Breach Notification Rule.
Practical Tips When Using Tracking Technologies
Enter into a BAA with a tracking technology vendor that meets the definition of a “business associate.”
Ensure that all disclosures of ePHI to tracking technologies are permitted by HIPAA and, unless an exception applies, only the minimum necessary ePHI to achieve the intended purpose is disclosed. This should be specifically stated in either the agreement with the vendor or the BAA.
Address the use of tracking technologies in the covered entity’s risk analysis and risk management processes required by HIPAA, as well as implement other adminis- trative, physical, and technical safeguards in accordance with the HIPAA Security Rule, including:
Encrypt ePHI that is transmitted to the tracking technology vendor.
Enable and use appropriate authentication, access, encryption and audit controls when accessing ePHI maintained in the tracking technology vendor’s infrastructure.
Health care providers often find it daunting to negotiate with technology vendors and ensure all the regulatory requirements are addressed, and health care technology companies need to ensure the development of compliant technology to see success in the health care marketplace.
The Bulletin provides a broad interpretation of what constitutes ePHI and how Regulated Entities may gather, use, and disclose, knowingly and unknowingly, that information using online tracking technologies through websites and portals. Because this is the first time a specific alert has been issued to physicians, health systems, and hospitals, it shows the need for Regulated Entities to continuously assess usage of these tracking technologies and the risk of compromise of ePHI. Balancing the need for greater access to care for patients with protecting the very health data collected through this access will be a concern for Regulated Entities for years to come.",0.9187847971916199,1576,1.8663887977600098
"- Firm preparing for the possibility of a prolonged downturn.
- Departed staff to get accelerated equity vesting and 12 weeks of severance.
- Crypto.com, Coinbase recently laid off staff.
Leading NFT marketplace OpenSea announces lay off up to 20% of its staff. According to Co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer, OpenSea is preparing for the possibility of a prolonged downturn.
“The reality is that we have entered an unprecedented combination of crypto winter and broad macroeconomic instability, and we need to prepare the company for the possibility of a prolonged downturn,” said CEO to the employees in a discord screenshot shared publicly on Twitter.
Finzer stated that the impacted employees will be receiving health insurance into 2023 along with accelerated equity vesting and 12 weeks of severance. In the internal memo to employees staff, Finzer noted he further plans to help departing staff with their job search through personal networks where possible.
The layoffs will place OpenSea in a position to maintain five years of the runway through a crypto winter, according to the CEO. In his note to staff, Finzer says the changes the firm is making today will put them in a position to maintain multiple years of runway under various crypto winter scenarios (5 years at the current volume).
Why the layoff?
Many in the industry believe OpenSea’s aggressive growth tactics and their ignorant approach to the sustainability of the NFT sector’s breakneck growth may have put them in this position.
The NFT market despite hitting a high in January with $16.6 billion in monthly volume, went down to about $1 billion in June. The recent case of insider trading of digital tokens involving OpenSea’s former employee further hampered the firm’s reputation.
Looking at numbers, OpenSea was valued at $13.3 billion in January. At the beginning of 2022, co-founders Devin Finzer and Alex Attah were each worth around $2.2 billion. Within a span of a few months, OpenSea’s revenue declined rapidly. In the last 30 days, the platform’s revenue had declined by a staggering 92%.
How did a company worth this much in 2022 beginning reach concerning lows in a span of few months? Are market volatility and the current bear market only the ones to blame for the downfall? OpenSea’s lack of proper risk management is highlighted in the latest decision to lay off employees.
OpenSea which is the largest NFT marketplace by volume, however, is not the first Web3 firm to lay off staff in recent months. Mass layoffs at crypto companies are becoming more and more in the recent day as market volatilities continue to keep these firms in a tough spot. Crypto trading platform Gemini Trust recently cut 10% of its employees amid the ongoing bear crypto market.
Bitpanda-one of the biggest names in the crypto business also reduced its headcount from nearly 1,000 employees to 730. In June, Crypto.com announced the layoff of 260 employees, citing choppy market conditions. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently announced that the exchange would be laying off 18% of its workforce, blaming the broader market turndown.
Despite the grim crypto market situation, many big names in the industry are still looking to hire new employees. The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance currently has nearly 950 openings in its website.",0.9592480659484863,700,0.9512420892715454
"Kraken, a prominent U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is actively considering the expansion of its services to include the trading of stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in both the United States and the United Kingdom, as per a Bloomberg report citing an insider source. Should this initiative materialize, Kraken would become the first crypto exchange to venture beyond cryptocurrency assets, with plans indicating a potential launch of the service as early as 2024.
Notably, FTX’s U.S. division previously offered stock trading options, despite facing financial difficulties. In contrast, traditional trading platforms such as Robinhood and Wealthsimple have already embraced cryptocurrency token trading.
Kraken intends to implement this new service through its newly established entity, Kraken Securities. The division has already obtained the requisite regulatory authorizations in the U.K. but awaits approval in the United States, according to the anonymous source cited by Bloomberg. When approached for a comment, Kraken remained non-committal, stating that while they couldn’t confirm or deny speculations, they are constantly exploring ways to support the global adoption of cryptocurrencies and expand their offerings to ensure clients have secure access to their full suite of products.
Kraken’s pursuit of international markets has intensified recently in response to increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States. As part of this expansion strategy, Kraken was forced to cease its crypto staking service and settle charges brought forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by paying a $30 million fine. In a recent development, the exchange also secured registration as a virtual asset service provider in Spain, enabling them to offer cryptocurrency exchange and custodial wallet services to Spanish residents.",0.9623903632164001,341,1.396852970123291

"Harrisburg, PA—Pennsylvania voters elected a Governor last Tuesday who is committed to school choice, sending a message that our children’s right to an excellent education is one they are not willing to compromise.
The Commonwealth Foundation reinforced this message by releasing a poll today that shows that half of Pennsylvanians support education vouchers in their state. The poll, conducted one day before the election, revealed that 50 percent of Pennsylvanians think that education vouchers should be used for those who want to send their children to a private school, rather than paying taxes to a public school that may be underperforming or failing.
Additionally, those polled feel strongly that all students should have the option to receive the vouchers, as opposed to merely low-income students in underperforming schools. Of the 500 polled, 67 percent prefer that all students be eligible to receive vouchers, with 20 percent stating that vouchers should go only to low-income students or those in schools with poor performance. Fourteen percent were undecided.
“These numbers are compelling,” said Matthew J. Brouillette, President and CEO of the Commonwealth Foundation and a former teacher and school board member. “It’s clear that Pennsylvanians not only want school choice for their own children, but support those in the quest to place their kids in schools and educational programs best-suited to these families. We’ve always argued that students should have the freedom to break away from underperforming schools rather than be forced to attend a school based merely on where they live. And now we see that most Pennsylvanians feel the same way.”
The poll, conducted Nov. 1 by Pulse Opinion Research, asked 500 likely voters in the state their views on tax credit funded scholarships, education vouchers, and the students who should be eligible for these programs. Forty-six percent of those polled supported the concept of Pennsylvania’s Educational Improvement Tax Credit, which provides companies with a 75 percent tax credit for donations to a non-profit scholarship or educational improvement organization. Thirty percent were opposed to the credits and 24 percent were undecided.
In light of these poll results, and in the wake of newsworthy election issues that have emerged, the Commonwealth Foundation will sponsor a Nov. 15 Policies & Principles Luncheon on issues surrounding the recent election, namely school choice, the state budget, spending cuts, and privatizing liquor sales.
Those confirmed to attend the forum include former Democratic Pennsylvania House Speaker Bob O’Donnell, Chairman of the Senate Education Committee Sen. Jeff Piccola, and Rep. Mike Turzai (R-Allegheny). Also invited are Rep. Sam Smith (R-Jefferson) and Sen. Anthony Williams (D-Philadelphia).

"In a nutshell, Gov. Tom Wolf’s guiding philosophy on education reform is to spend more money on public schools.
Embracing the repeatedly-debunked myth of education cuts under the previous administration—and undeterred by the weak relationship between spending and academic outcomes—Wolf leans heavily on this slogan in speaking engagements and social media:
However, no one is proposing to “make Pennsylvania schools weaker.” Even if you accept the governor’s shaky premise that a school’s strength is solely measured by dollars spent, you’d be hard pressed to find lawmakers—Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal—arguing for less education spending.
Except, of course, when it comes to cyber charter students.
Since the governor’s March budget address, Pennsylvania’s cyber students have been under attack. Wolf initially proposed to slash cyber revenues to $5,950 per student—an arbitrary sum that would reduce per-student spending by one-third. (For the sake of comparison, traditional school districts spend over $15,000 per-student in Pennsylvania).
This radical proposal never gained traction, but late last week Wolf demanded the “budget framework” include a provision cutting cyber funding by an estimated $65 million over the next two years. At a time when the state is increasing aid to school districts by more than $350 million, cyber schools—which enroll a higher percentage of low-income and special education students than do district schools—are threatened with devastating cuts.
In June, many cyber leaders actually agreed to provisions in a House-passed charter reform bill that included, among other things, a significant reduction in per-student revenue. But the Wolf-approved Senate plan cuts cyber funding three times more than the original agreement.
Can Pennsylvania grow stronger if cyber schools are made weaker? Or is Wolf content to treat 36,000 cyber students like second-class citizens?",0.9483664631843567,395,1.9413576126098633

In the past two weeks, several Jewish megadonors and their allies have thunderously announced that they are pulling financial support from their alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. The donor letters that have been made public thus far eviscerate Penn president Liz Magill and other university leaders for failing to condemn the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians as terrorism.
The letters illuminate Magill’s apparent struggle to clarify the university’s position on antisemitism after four Penn departments sponsored a shocking number of antisemitic speakers at the Palestinian Writes festival on campus in late September, just weeks prior to the terrorist attacks in Israel.
One of the outraged donors pulling their support was Penn alumnus and billionaire donor David Magerman, a computer scientist and philanthropist. Magerman excoriated Penn’s “misguided moral compass.” He was joined by Penn alumni Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management, Marc Rowan of Apollo Global Management, Law & Order creatorDick Wolf, former U.S. diplomat and businessman Jon Huntsman, and president of the World Jewish Congress, Ronald Lauder. These Penn donors are part of a growing cadre of billionaires who are pulling their money from America’s most vaunted colleges and universities after realizing there is a moral rot in higher education.

"Mark Steines is a three-time Emmy winner. He has interviewed thousands of A-list actors as well as producers, athletes, and musicians. Mark has set the gold standard in entertainment news while working at “Entertainment Tonight” for over 17 years. He is currently the host of the new series, “Animal ER Live” by National Geographic.
CHRISTINA: How does it feel to be on the other side of the interview?
MARK: Oh you know it’s just a conversation, I think you know; I try not to get in the hot seat or anything like that. It’s just fun. I don’t feel as comfortable being interviewed but when it’s about something like this… it’s really truly magical, I think everybody can relate to what the show is about. We all have at some point or another cherished an animal in our life or something, so it’s gonna be a good show.
Tell us about your new show Animal ER Live.
Animal ER Live is a two hour show that is on a four-weekend run, starting this weekend; it is really pulling the curtain back going into these amazing seven hospitals. We are live so everything is unscripted and you have no idea what is going to happen.
The goal of the show is to showcase the people who have dedicated their lives to being, educated, well-equipped, and available 24–7 to take care of animals.
We are in rehearsals making sure everything’s operational for the live feeds. Someone brought in a big dog who had had swallowed women’s underwear. It opens the question for our audience, how many times does your dog tear up a tennis ball while playing with it? When they tear it apart…does he ever swallow any of it? And if so, where does it go? Does it pass through him? Our vet experts; Will Draper and Dr. Justine Lee on set and they give us such advice and guide us through these type of emergencies. They explain what is considered an emergency… and in this case it was, it could have been very lethal for a dog. They had to go into the operating room we watch the procedure from a safe distance as the Vets opened his stomach and safely remove the underwear — without showing the gory surgery. We focus on the before and after, switching to other events at the other clinics, we are not trying to gross or shock our audience.
The Vets never know what’s going to enter the clinic, much like the way ER doctors in the real world, a lot of these animals are treated. We had a seven-week-old puppy [who] came in for a wellness check and it was just the cutest thing ever. You know seeing the beginning of life, it’s just so wonderful, it’s a real feel good show for everybody involved and I’m just excited to see what happens.
I have worked in this business a long time, it’s always about your prep work, whether it was the red carpet at Entertainment Tonight or interviews that I did on other shows; preparation is important, but on Animal ER Live, I cannot really prepare the story. I just need to be present in the moment the same way, the doctors go to work everyday, they have no idea what scenario they’ll be faced with.
[MARK] I know I’m just sorta rambling here…
[CHRISTINA] No, it’s informational.
What appeals to you most about the show?
I am an animal lover. We have two dogs at home and growing up I’ve always had dogs. With Animal ER Live we get to be a fly on the wall as you see these amazing live experience watching the best veterinarian hospitals and clinics and care help our pets. We get to see a major animal facility like Angel in Boston, it’s Harvard; people going to school and wanting to have their internships. The work our Vets do is really important and I’m excited to show it live on TV.
What have you learned while on the show?
Nat Geo Wild is an amazing network. They really care about people and pets. With Animal ER Live I am learning all sorts of things that can help and hurt our pets. For example, tea tree oil can be very toxic for a dog to inhale. There’s a lot of takeaway in this show for our audience — whether you’re a cat or dog owner; we also are dealing with horses and exotic animals. The show has mobile units in Fort Bragg, California; Mendocino Equine and Livestock; which travel to help animals. It’s difficult to get a horse or cattle into a veterinarian office, so and they make ‘house’ calls.
I believe Boston’s Angel Medical Center sees an average of 70–100 cases per weekend. Some of those calls can be checkups or for vaccinations, but those who are coming in at that hour between 9 and 11 when they’re live since we are live at night, usually the animals that enter the clinic are there for an emergency.
What are your thoughts on animal healthcare?
At home we have Norbert my wife’s therapy dog; with more than two million social media followers and he has a really strong purpose — and because of him, I met my wife. Norbert is magic, he and my wife Julie volunteer as a dog therapy team at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. We also have our Golden Retriever Fred, who was in Disney’s Spooky Buddies movie. He was a theatre acting puppy and my boys and I adopted him from the movie set.
Before Fred and Norbert, we had a German Shepard named Alex. She had pancreas problems and it was a lot to maintain. It was extremely hard watching her quality of life diminish quickly. You know it’s the great circle of life that we all face with pets and with life. I think to answer your question; I think it is important to do whatever we can to make sure our animals are fed good quality food, that we’re providing them good clean water and making sure they are well taken care of.
My first date with my wife was to the American Human’s Hero Dog Awards. I have been involved with them and was presenting at their award show. The show shines light on how special dogs are… whether it’s military grade type of stuff or police and swat units; therapy dogs, dogs that work with Veterans or those suffering from PTSD, there are even dogs that will sense someone’s going to have a seizure. Dog[s] make our lives better.
Dr. Will Draper and I were having this conversation because I wore a t-shirt to rehearsal that said, “I like dogs” and people gave me a hard time, “oh do you have one that says cats?” I go… “l’ll make one, I’ll get one.” But he goes, “you know the saying of dogs and cats..” I said, “what?” He goes, “a dog, when you feed a dog; the dog will look at you and be, oh my God, this is a God… look at him he’s taking care of me, he’s a God! And then when you feed a cat; the cat looks at you and goes, this guy thinks I’m a God.” I mean a cat will teach you independence and they’ll teach you solitude, they’ll teach you how to be Zen. By just observing them, they can sit and be still and yet run in a room and have no idea why they ran in there; they bring a lot of joy and happiness.
What is your most favorite interview that you’ve done as a host?
I don’t really have a favorite person, let me step back and say there is a lot of interviews that I’ve had over the years. I can say that I truly enjoyed seeing and spending time with Cher, John Travolta and bless his heart; I have never been able to conduct a proper interview with Robin Williams. Robin drew me into a weird parallel, you never knew what to expect and it was always a blast. Before my last interview with him, I was preparing the night before thinking: “What am I gonna ask him?” With him, you might think your leading it, but he just takes over. I said “Robin” and he goes, “yeah chief” and I said “hey, I just have one question, it’s only one, just one question. He goes, “oh really, one question?” I go, “yeah.” And he goes, “fire away.” [Mark] “Robin Williams, what do ya think?” And he just looked at me and goes; “That’s your question? What do I think? Oh my God that’s brilliant!” And he just went off. You know, that’s all I needed to say to him; He could do his own shtick because it just gave him this massive pasture to run around in. One minute he was talking about his heart procedure that he had and then […] just when off; it was true Robin. So those are the kinds of interviews that I truly enjoy.
What advice can you give the readers?
Experience life; be in the moment, be present, be kind to one another. Be willing to reach across the aisle because; we live in a divided country right now and kindness goes so much greater than just screaming at each other. Realize that we’re blessed in so many ways and that we’re all here for such a short period of time; let’s make the best of it.
What are your plans for the future?
One step in front of another, one step at a time. Just stay present and spend as much time with my family as possible. I know this has been said a million times but nobody’s said on their death bed; “I wish I spent more time at the office.” And there’s something to be said about that. Being around family and watching my kids grow up, I have a baby daughter now so I get a chance to watch her go through the early stages of development. I’m kind of getting a chance to go back in time and relive some of those early years. My boys are 17 and 15; I got one that’s studying for his first driving permit and another one’s that just got a driver’s license. I don’t want to miss out on that time.
I think there is a good piece of advice; there’s a story that was shared with me once, it’s about that point in your life when your about to say goodbye. You want to look back down the road you’ve traveled and see the people that you’ve been blessed with walking the same path. When I say path, I mean the beliefs that you put forth. […] That they don’t judge, they allowed other people to be who they are, that they don’t get over critical of themselves. Social media has us constantly comparing each other to what’s in that little square box. It’s not even real; it’s fake you know. [Laughs] So, I think there’s a lot of pressure. I’m glad my kids are not big on social media. That’s a long answer to your question.
Thank you for the interview. I can’t wait for your show!
Oh good. Wonderful. I hope you like it Christina… I really do. It’s exactly what Nat Geo Wild is about and then some people say; “Oh, it’s gonna be gory. It’s gonna be this, it’s gonna be that.” It’s not. I’m sure that stuff happens and we’ll probably cover it to the extent we feel is appropriate because you know, there could be children watching. You know when those pet owners are reunited with their little dog or cat; there’s a special moment. These animals are our children and we carry the same emotions. I hope people tune-in and enjoy it.

"Welcome to our comprehensive guide on Argon2 vs PBKDF2, two of the most popular password hashing algorithms in the world of cybersecurity. In this article, we’ll explore the key differences between Argon2 and PBKDF2, examining their security features, performance, and best use cases. Whether you are a developer looking to enhance your application’s security or simply curious about the best practices for protecting your sensitive data, you’ll find valuable insights here. Join us as we break down the strengths and weaknesses of each hashing method, helping you make an informed decision for your password management needs.
What is Argon2
Argon2 is a modern cryptographic hash function specifically designed for password hashing and key derivation. Developed in 2015 and the winner of the Password Hashing Competition (PHC), Argon2 focuses on security against both brute-force attacks and specialized hardware attacks. It comes in two variants: Argon2d, which is resistant to GPU cracking attacks, and Argon2i, which is optimized for side-channel attack resistance. The flexibility in configuring memory usage, time cost, and parallelism makes Argon2 a powerful choice for developers looking to enhance password security.
Popular Use Cases of Argon2
Argon2 is increasingly being adopted across various applications due to its robust security features. Some of the most popular use cases include:
- Web Applications: Many web applications utilize Argon2 for securely storing user passwords. It ensures that even if the database is compromised, the passwords remain protected.
- Mobile Apps: Developers of mobile applications use Argon2 to enhance the security of sensitive user data, such as authentication tokens and personal information.
- Cryptocurrency Wallets: With the rise of cryptocurrencies, Argon2 is employed in wallets to secure private keys, adding an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.
What is PBKDF2
PBKDF2, or Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2, is a widely used key derivation function that applies a pseudorandom function, such as HMAC, to a password along with a salt and an iteration count. Introduced in 2000 and specified in RFC 2898, PBKDF2 is designed to make password cracking more difficult by increasing the time it takes to compute the hash. While it is an established and trusted method, its reliance on parameters like iteration count makes it less flexible compared to newer alternatives like Argon2.
Popular Use Cases of PBKDF2
PBKDF2 remains a popular choice in various applications, including:
- Legacy Systems: Many older systems still utilize PBKDF2 for password hashing due to its long-standing reputation and established security practices.
- Secure File Storage: Applications that require secure file storage use PBKDF2 for encrypting file access keys, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot easily gain access.
- Web Services: Various web services implement PBKDF2 for user authentication, providing a reliable means of protecting user credentials.
Argon2 vs PBKDF2: Understanding the Differences
While both Argon2 and PBKDF2 serve the same ultimate purpose of securely hashing passwords, they differ significantly in design and performance.
Argon2 offers more advanced security features, including memory-hardness properties, which make it resistant to GPU and ASIC attacks. PBKDF2, while secure, relies primarily on increasing iteration counts, which can be less effective against modern hardware.
Argon2 is designed to be highly configurable, allowing developers to adjust memory and processing time according to their needs. This adaptability makes it well-suited for various environments. On the other hand, PBKDF2 can be less flexible, as it primarily focuses on the number of iterations, which might not be sufficient against powerful hardware.
Adoption and Support
Argon2 is gaining traction in modern applications, supported by many programming languages and frameworks. PBKDF2 has been widely adopted for years, giving it a solid base in established systems. However, as security standards evolve, Argon2's advantages may lead to a decline in PBKDF2's popularity.
In the debate of Argon2 vs PBKDF2, Argon2 emerges as the more advanced and flexible option for password hashing and key derivation. Its innovative design prioritizes security against contemporary threats, making it an ideal choice for new applications. However, PBKDF2's long-standing reliability means it will continue to be utilized in legacy systems. Ultimately, the choice between Argon2 and PBKDF2 should be guided by specific project requirements, security needs, and future scalability considerations. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, opting for the most robust hashing algorithm is crucial in safeguarding sensitive user data.",0.9244948029518127,960,2.5710952281951904

Understanding Arteries in the Human Body
Types of Blood Vessels: Arteries, Capillaries, and Veins
The human circulatory system comprises three main types of blood vessels: arteries, capillaries, and veins. Arteries are responsible for transporting oxygen-rich blood from the heart to various tissues and organs throughout the body . The aorta, the largest artery, branches into smaller arteries that supply blood to specific regions, including the kidneys, liver, intestines, and extremities.
Classification of Arteries: Elastic, Muscular, and Arterioles
Arteries are categorized based on their size and the composition of their walls. The largest arteries, known as elastic arteries, have walls rich in elastic tissue, allowing them to withstand and regulate the high pressure of blood pumped from the heart. As arteries branch and decrease in size, they become muscular arteries, which contain more smooth muscle and less elastic tissue. The smallest arteries, called arterioles, are highly responsive to neural and endocrine signals, adjusting their diameter to regulate blood flow and pressure before blood enters the capillaries.
End Arterial System and Capillary Beds
In certain organs, arteries form an end arterial system, where they branch and subdivide without forming anastomoses (connections) with adjacent arteries. This system ensures that each artery independently supplies blood to its designated capillary bed. An example of this is found in the kidneys. If an artery in this system becomes occluded, it can lead to tissue necrosis due to the lack of alternative blood supply routes.
Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)
Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a condition characterized by the blockage of arteries that supply blood to the extremities, often due to atherosclerosis. This condition can lead to reduced blood flow, causing symptoms such as pain and, in severe cases, tissue damage. PAD is a common manifestation of atherosclerosis, which can affect various major arteries in the body, including those in the heart (coronary artery disease) and brain (cerebrovascular disease).
Anatomical Variations and Clinical Relevance
The anatomy of arteries can vary significantly among individuals, which has important implications for medical imaging and surgical procedures. Knowledge of these variations is crucial for healthcare professionals to avoid complications during interventions. For instance, the presence of aberrant arteries or unusual topographies can pose risks during surgeries and require careful planning.
Molecular Distinction Between Arteries and Veins
Recent research has revealed that arterial and venous endothelial cells are molecularly distinct even before the heart begins to pump blood in embryos. This discovery highlights the existence of genetic programs that coordinate the differentiation of arteries and veins, challenging the previous belief that circulatory dynamics alone established this distinction.
Arterial Anatomy in Specific Regions
The abdominal artery, originating from the heart, supplies oxygenated blood to the abdominal and pelvic organs and the legs. Advanced imaging techniques, such as CT and MR, are used to model the abdominal artery for detailed analysis, which is essential for understanding blood flow dynamics and addressing issues like atherosclerosis.
The cerebral arteries, which supply blood to the brain, exhibit both similarities and differences between humans and other species, such as rats. These arteries are prone to conditions like aneurysms and thrombosis, which can lead to serious health issues. The presence of collateral circulation in humans provides a safety margin, ensuring continued blood supply in case of occlusion.
Arteries play a crucial role in the circulatory system by delivering oxygen-rich blood from the heart to various parts of the body. Understanding the different types of arteries, their anatomical variations, and conditions like PAD is essential for effective medical diagnosis and treatment. Advances in imaging and molecular biology continue to enhance our knowledge of arterial function and pathology, contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.

"Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month is observed every November to spotlight pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest cancers worldwide. Known as a ""silent killer,"" pancreatic cancer often goes undetected until it reaches advanced stages, making awareness and early diagnosis crucial. Through education and awareness, this month serves as an opportunity to unite people, support those affected, and highlight the ongoing research efforts to improve treatment and survival rates.
Pancreatic cancer is the 12th most common cancer globally, but its impact is disproportionately high due to its low survival rate. It's the 11th most common cancer in both men and women, yet it ranks among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Here’s a closer look at what pancreatic cancer is, its global impact, and what we can do to combat this devastating disease.
The Global Burden of Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic cancer has become a growing health issue worldwide. According to the latest statistics from 2022, there were over 510,992 new cases of pancreatic cancer globally. In terms of mortality, it claimed approximately 467,409 lives in the same year. This high mortality rate emphasises the aggressive nature of pancreatic cancer and the challenges in treating it.
While pancreatic cancer cases are rising globally, certain countries bear the brunt more heavily than others. The 10 countries with the highest incidence of pancreatic cancer and the highest number of related deaths include the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, to name a few. In India, for instance, there were 13,661 new cases and 12,759 deaths attributed to pancreatic cancer in 2022. Although India's case numbers are relatively lower than in some Western countries, the fatality rate is similarly concerning.
Pancreatic Cancer Statistics at a Glance
- Worldwide New Cases (2022): 510,992
- Worldwide Deaths (2022): 467,409
- New Cases in India (2022): 13,661
- Deaths in India (2022): 12,759
These statistics show a bleak picture, but they also underscore the importance of early diagnosis, timely intervention, and continued research to improve survival rates.
History of Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month
Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month was established to foster a sense of solidarity and focus public attention on a disease that often gets overlooked. Organizations worldwide, such as the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN) and the World Pancreatic Cancer Coalition, work tirelessly to amplify awareness and funding for research.
The concept behind the awareness month is rooted in the urgent need for advancements in detection and treatment. Pancreatic cancer's late diagnosis is often due to a lack of symptoms in its early stages. By the time it’s detected, it has often spread to other organs, making treatment options limited. Advocacy groups use this month to organize events, share stories, raise funds, and promote educational resources, all to spread awareness and hope for patients and their families.
Why Pancreatic Cancer Is So Deadly
Pancreatic cancer's high mortality rate can be attributed to several factors. The pancreas is located deep within the abdomen, making it difficult to detect abnormalities in its early stages. The symptoms are often vague, such as abdominal pain, weight loss, jaundice, and loss of appetite, which can be mistaken for other conditions. These factors contribute to delayed diagnosis and treatment, with most patients only being diagnosed at advanced stages when the cancer has already spread.
The survival rate for pancreatic cancer is low, with only about 10% of patients surviving five years after diagnosis. This rate drops even further for those diagnosed at later stages, highlighting the importance of early detection and awareness.
Risk Factors for Pancreatic Cancer
Although the exact cause of pancreatic cancer is still unknown, several risk factors may increase an individual’s likelihood of developing the disease:
Age: Most people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are over the age of 60.
Smoking: Tobacco use significantly increases the risk of developing pancreatic cancer.
Family History: Individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer have a higher risk.
Chronic Pancreatitis: Long-term inflammation of the pancreas can increase the risk.
Diabetes: There is a link between diabetes and pancreatic cancer, although it’s not entirely understood.
Obesity and Diet: Obesity and a diet high in red and processed meats are considered risk factors.
Awareness of these risk factors can help individuals assess their risk and make lifestyle changes to reduce their likelihood of developing pancreatic cancer.
Signs and Symptoms of Pancreatic Cancer
Since pancreatic cancer is often asymptomatic in its early stages, recognizing symptoms can be challenging. However, as the cancer progresses, some common signs include:
- Abdominal or back pain
- Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
- Sudden weight loss
- Loss of appetite
- Dark-colored urine
- Fatigue and weakness
- Digestive problems, including nausea and vomiting
If you or someone you know experiences these symptoms persistently, it’s essential to consult our best oncologist. Early diagnosis can make a significant difference.
Advancements and Hope: The Path Forward
While pancreatic cancer remains difficult to treat, research efforts are ongoing to develop better diagnostic tools, treatment options, and, hopefully, a cure. Some recent advancements include:
Immunotherapy: New studies are exploring ways to stimulate the immune system to target cancer cells.
Personalized Medicine: Genetic testing is being used to create customized treatments based on an individual’s genetic makeup.
Early Detection Techniques: Researchers are working on developing blood tests and other tools to detect pancreatic cancer in its early stages.
These advancements are hopeful signs that we may be able to improve survival rates and outcomes for those diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the future.

"GDPR has been at the forefront of privacy, security, risk and controls discussions in many firms since last year. Many are in the midst of large scale “compliance” programmes, spending enormous amounts with the view of achieving something by the 25th of May (£15M on average for FTSE100 firms according to a study by SIA Partners).
But the truth is that GDPR “compliance” is not a defined concept, in spite of what tech vendors and many consultancies – large and small – would like firms to believe. The 99 articles still hide literally hundreds of potential compliance points and many undefined language elements (“large scale”, “state of the art”, “adequate” security measures etc…), over which the guidelines of the WP29 have shed little light in practice so far, and over which the interpretation of regulators will have to be applied.
“What good looks like” is still an elusive idea for many organisations, and as we stated repeatedly last year – mostly in our 2017 white paper – it will take months for precedents to emerge and years for the dust to settle.
Let’s not forget that the GDPR will be enforced by each domestic regulator across the EU, each with their own history and practice around the topic.
- Is it conceivable that some could start to “knock on doors” on May 28th? (May 26th is a Saturday as I was reminded politely at a conference in Paris last December…)
- Is it conceivable that some could take a much harder line than others – or turn a blind eye on some matters – forcing precedents across Europe?
- Is it conceivable that the GDPR could be just a huge sledgehammer aimed at cracking the GAFA nut (and that nothing will really happen for average firms across the continent)?
Those are some of the “known unknowns” around the GDPR.
So the real deadline is not really May 25th anymore, but the unknown point in time when the first real fine will be set.
In practice, this will take at least several extra months (the time for the first incidents to be detected, reported and where relevant, investigated).
Whether they take a hard line on an irrelevant incident, focus only on the GAFA or other high profile cases, allow themselves to be challenged in court over unreasonable fines, or take inconsistent positions from one country to another, the regulators role and their credibility could be damaged. They asked for real powers for a decade, now they truly have a hard balance to find.
Does this mean that it is best to do nothing for now and wait (in particular if you are waking up to the problem at this stage)? I don’t think so.
The GDPR forms part of a true evolution of society towards a more responsible use of personal data by the corporate world and public institutions. This is a long-term trend, unlikely to see reversals.
One more time, for those who want to make real progress across the next few months and 2018, the key for now is not to panic, to start by analysing their current level of maturity around data privacy matters and to build a GDPR alignment roadmap that matches their own priorities and their own resources, looking towards the May 25th deadline and beyond as necessary: There are things that will be achievable by May (fewer and fewer as time runs out) and things that will take more time. This must not become a mere box-ticking exercise and will be a matter of cultural shift for many firms: There is no magic product or magic checklist that is going to make you GDPR compliant in a few months if you are truly starting from scratch today.
At this very late stage, the problem goes far beyond financial resources and FTEs if the objective is to create true transformational dynamics on the topic: It is key to ensure that internal sponsorship is at a level high enough to be audible across silos (legal, technical, operational) and across the firm (business units, geographies, key external partners), and to make sure a governance structure is put in place that will track alignment progress efficiently and effectively.
As we have pointed out before, evidence of strong management backing and a genuine trackable long-term approach towards putting in place the “privacy by design” principles which are at the heart of the regulation, should always play in anybody’s favour with regulators, irrespective of the actual compliance challenges you may be facing.

"Marcia Johnson completes 150km skating charity challenge for the Countess of Brecknock Hospice
Marcia Johnson, Communications Manager for Stannah Lift Services Ltd has completed a 150km skating charity challenge to raise funds for the Countess of Brecknock Trust.
Marcia has managed to raise over £900 for the local hospice and, thanks to the pledge from Stannah to match funds raised by 150 per cent (to mark this year’s 150th anniversary), the grand total has reached a whopping £2,250 and is still rising.
Marcia completed the gruelling 150km skating challenge (which equates to 93.2 miles), in six parts, over 11 hours throughout the summer.
45km of the distance was covered during the South Coast Roll Event at Goodwood Motor Circuit on the 18th June, and another 45km was ticked off when Marcia completed the South-East Roller Marathon at Dorney Lakes (home of the London 2012 Olympics rowing event) on Sunday 30th July. Marcia finished the final 60km in her own time, through family outings at Southsea and by roller-skating at Brooklands Racing Circuit near Weybridge.
The funds raised will help to support the crucial services the Countess of Brecknock Trust provides. Originally founded with the Support of Macmillan Cancer relief, the trust has been providing care and community support since it was set up in 1990.
The trust’s day hospice service, (available Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays 10am-3pm), can accommodate up to 15 patients and enables a break from routine for patients as well as essential respite for their full-time careers.
Their inpatient unit comprises of six individual patient rooms with en-suite facilities, as well as a communal lounge and family room areas, all overseen by a dedicated team consultant in Palliative Medicine, general doctors, a nursing team, therapists and even a counsellor.
Although Marcia confesses that she has always enjoyed roller-skating, taking on a challenge of such a large scale was no easy feat; especially as Marcia admits that before completing this challenge she wasn’t a particularly active person.
“It’s got me out and got me roller-skating again which has been great. I also wanted to do something to raise money that was a little different and thankfully, the level of support I have received has made it worthwhile.”
The charity also means a lot to Marcia personally as her mother-in-law is currently using the hospice’s day service.
“I’m really pleased everyone has been so supportive and I just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone that has sponsored me.
It’s fantastic that Stannah have match funded my efforts by 150% as it has meant that I’ve managed to raise even more vital funds for the hospice”

"Would “Rose Colored Glasses” by any other name sound as sweet?
John Conlee will never know, but his 1978 hit actually began with another title.
“When I started writing it, I was using ‘love colored glasses,’” he said. “During the process I thought of the old phrase ‘rose colored glasses’ and promptly changed it. I’m not sure of the genesis of the phrase, but the song certainly has kept it alive and spread it. The song may never have done a thing the other way. Like a lot of other things in life, some things are meant to be, and some things are not.”
“Rose Colored Glasses” launched a successful career for the disc jockey-turned-performer. The song spent 20 weeks on the Hot Country Singles chart in 1978 and became Conlee’s signature song. As the song became a country standard, Conlee’s fans often asked about obtaining rose-colored glasses for themselves, so in the early 1980s his first road manager and the song’s co-writer George Baber suggested offering them as a concession item. They remain his best-selling concert souvenir.
Conlee has released 29 singles throughout the years with 26 of them charting in the top 20 or better and eight reaching number one. He’s toured extensively, but he has always made sure he was at home as much as possible.
“I was never on the road for months at a time, even when I was busiest in those early years,” he said. “It’s a balancing act. I could never have been happy being gone for three months at a time. There were times when we would go to the West Coast and stay a couple of weeks, but that was my limit. I’d think ‘I got to see the farm before too much more time passes.’”
A native of rural Kentucky and a farm owner in Middle Tennessee, preservation of the family farm system is important to Conlee.
“The farm crisis reared its head in 1985,” he recalled, explaining what compelled him to perform a concert in Omaha, Neb., that June to benefit the National Farmers Organization and other farming support entities. “Then, when Willie Nelson announced his plans for a September Farm Aid concert, I called and offered to help. I was part of the first 10 Farm Aid concerts, and Willie has kept on doing them.”
The singer spoke passionately and knowledgeably about modern farming practices that have continued to destroy the farming infrastructure.
“The reason Farm Aid ended up being created was because this was not a front page story in the first place, even though it should have been,” he observed.
Conlee admitted that he’s never had a great memory for jokes or stories, but he did make a confession about the event he called “certainly a highlight of my career – of my life.”
“For years I had in my mind and told people that Roy Acuff inducted me into the Grand Ole Opry,” he said. “He did not. It was Porter Wagoner. I found that out by listening to an old tape of my induction! There is so much excitement at an event like that, it’s easy to lose some of the details.”
One event, however, he has not forgotten.
“Ray Charles and I both had hits with a song called ‘Busted,’” Conlee said. “I heard his version as a teenager, never imagining that I would sing it or any other song on a record, let alone that it would become a hit for me too.”
Conlee said that Charles tops his list of favorite artists, so he was thrilled to be slated for a Las Vegas performance in the early 1980s with the legendary soul singer, whom he had never met.
“It was around that time I had a song on the charts called ‘I Don’t Remember Loving You,’” Conlee said. “When Ray came out of his dressing room, he started singing the words ‘I don’t remember loving you.’ It left me speechless.”

"I have always loved the movies. Like every grade school kid watching reruns, I cried when Bambi’s mother died, and when starry eyed Judy Garland clicked her heels and said, “There’s no place like home!” But when the big budget films hit the screen in my early pre-teen years—Ben Hur, Camelot and Lawrence of Arabia, I was irretrievably hooked. Sitting in a dark theater, I could escape from actual or imagined troubles. Some people prefer live theater, but for me it was always the big screen, where I could pretend to be Guinevere as Lancelot leaned in for a kiss, or Holly Golightly, or Cleopatra, up close, more real than in real life. By high school I was reading the film critic’s reviews in our local paper, and by college I had my favorites. Pauline Kael was far too esoteric for me—my “go to guys” were Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert with their trademark “thumbs up” or “thumbs down.”
I was channel surfing last night and I just happened upon CNN which was airing a documentary film about Roger Ebert, his career and his struggle with cancer called “Life Itself” from his memoir of the same title. I had been aware that Ebert had been battling head and neck cancer for years before his death but I was not well versed in the details of his illness. Roger Ebert was diagnosed with papillary carcinoma of the thyroid in 2002, typically a rather low grade cancer treated primarily with surgery. Unfortunately he was unlucky and the cancer recurred, ultimately necessitating removal of his lower jaw with subsequent loss of his larynx, and his ability to speak and swallow. What was unique about Mr. Ebert was that unlike many public figures, especially those in the visual media whose jobs sometimes depend on facial appearances, he chose not only to go public with his illness, but to ENGAGE his many fans and followers in his day to day struggles via his website, his blog, and his Twitter account. He allowed Steve James, the documentary filmmaker, to film him not only on his best days, but also on his worst. He smiled and joked for the camera nearly immediately after his radical mandibulectomy and neck dissections, even as he was being suctioned for the secretions which if left untended would choke him. His wife Chaz, his stepchildren and grandchildren were equally generous, at a time when the family was undergoing much pain and hardship. He clearly had his demons and his days where he wanted to quit, but ultimately he was buoyed by the support he received from not only his fans, but from directors and actors he had at times panned. To see Martin Scorcese pause to wipe a tear on camera when discussing his friend was a window into what this person meant to his friends and peers.
What I had forgotten, and was reminded of while watching the documentary, was that Ebert was not the only member of the Siskel and Ebert team who suffered from cancer. Gene Siskel was operated on for glioblastoma, a malignant brain tumor, in the spring of 1998. Only his wife knew of the diagnosis—he chose not to even tell his children. He was back at work nearly immediately, and only when he became symptomatic again in early 2009, did he request a leave of absence from his show. He died of complications of a second surgery to deal with recurrence in February 1999. His friend and colleague Roger Ebert only learned the truth about the disease on a Friday, just days before he died, and had planned to see him on Monday. Siskel died that weekend. Ebert and his wife were devastated that they had not known, and had not been able to convey the love that was in their hearts. I can only imagine how his other friends and family felt.
In my career, I have seen it both ways. I have had patients who have their entire families with them for each treatment, who have written books about their illness, who have blogged about it, who have made public appearances and who have been pillars of support groups. I have also had patients who were absolutely adamant that no one, sometimes not even spouses or children, should know about their cancer and treatment. The reasons have been many—fear of unemployment, fear of upsetting loved ones, fear of being seen as weak or ill, and in one case, a minister who feared that his congregation would see his illness as punishment for prior sins. But the common denominator was always one thing: fear.
My patients generally have made up their own minds about what to reveal and to whom. I respect their decisions and support them in whatever way that I can. But when they do ask me, I always tell them that it is better not to take this particular journey alone. Not every movie has a well-executed plot or a happy ending. But as Siskel and Ebert would always say, there is joy in the characters you meet and love along the way.",0.9954386353492737,1059,1.2864407300949097

"Ever since the Colgan Air crash in Buffalo, there has been a renewed effort to revamp the pilot rest rules in the US, and now, we’ve finally seen a proposal from the FAA. To the layperson, this 39 page ruling (pdf) looks to be written in a foreign language, and about 5 pages in, you’re crying and rocking in the fetal position. So let’s see if I can break this down and explain exactly what’s being proposed here. Wish me luck. I fully expect a laundry list of comments with corrections from pilots here. (Please do.)
The FAA explains it this way:
Today’s proposal sets forth a matrix that addresses transient fatigue (i.e., the immediate, short-term fatigue that can be addressed by a recuperative rest opportunity) by establishing a 9-hour minimum rest opportunity prior to commencing duty directly associated with the operation of aircraft (flight duty period, or FDP), placing restrictions on
that type of duty, and further placing restrictions on flight time (that period of time when the aircraft is actually in motion—flight time is encompassed by FDP).
Get it? That’s what I thought. But fatigue really is the biggest issue here, and it’s good that it’s finally be addressed. The problem, however, is that no two sides will agree on how to address fatigue, so the FAA had to decide on something. The agency has put out its first proposal and now the comment period is open. There may very well be some changes before this becomes final.
Before we get started, there is one important distinction to be made. There is a difference between flight time and Flight Duty Period (FDP). Flight time is the time when you push back until you get back to the gate on the other side. FDP includes training, flight planning, and anything else involved in the operation of the flight. Transferring from the airport to the hotel doesn’t count, but that’s probably right where the line is drawn.
We’re going to have to make some generalizations here for simplicity’s sake. This proposal also hopes to simplify the rules across different types of operations, something that isn’t the case today. So let’s look at the rules that govern most travel for comparison purposes.
Duty Time Limits
Today, a pilot can fly 8 hours (flight time) in any 24 hour period. The new plan is going to vary based upon the number of flights scheduled during the day as well as the time that the pilot reports for duty. Why? Because it’s generally accepted that flight times that go against the body’s natural rhythm are more likely to cause fatigue, so pilots can’t fly as much while staying alert if they start their “day” in the middle of the night. Also, flying more flights in a day can add to fatigue. Here’s the new proposed chart.
As you can see, the big metric here is Flight Duty Period (FDP) instead of flight time, though flight time is still limited on the far right side. So now, if you start your day in the morning like most earthbound people would, you can be on duty for up to 13 hours and fly up to 10 hours. This means that some flights that couldn’t be done with two pilots in the past now might be possible if the flight time is between 8 and 10 hours. (This increase is going to be challenged by pilots for sure.) On the other hand, pilots could have been on duty for up to 16 hours in the past. But now, they’re limited to 13 at most.
The flip side of this is how much rest is required when not working. The previous rule required 8 hours of rest looking backwards in a 24 hour period. Now, the rule is 9 hours in the hotel. Also, pilots must get 30 consecutive hours off in each week, up from 24 hours today. Many still argue that 9 hours in the hotel isn’t enough, because everyone should get 8 hours of sleep per night and the body can’t be forced to just go to sleep on command.
Ways to Increase Duty Time
So now the idea is to limit flying to 10 hours at max, but that doesn’t really help us on long flights, right? How do you deal with a 15 hour flight from LA to Sydney? It’s called augmentation. If you add a third pilot, then you can fly longer. And if you add a fourth pilot, you can fly even longer. The idea is that the pilots work in shifts, so that when pilots aren’t working, they can get rest in the back. But to get rest, pilots need to have adequate facilities, and that’s been taken into account in the new system for extended duty times. Here’s what that looks like now.
As you can see here, the rules come to a hard stop at 16 hours, but what about flights that are longer? There are special procedures that an airline can use through the FAA to get special exemptions created with specific plans for those rare ultra-long flights.
There is also another way to get more time from a pilot. It’s called split duty. That’s when a pilot is on duty, gets a break in the middle, and then flies more at the end. If there are adequate rest facilties (eg hotel room) and there’s enough time, then that can be used as a scheduling tool.
As if that wasn’t confusing enough, some fun-filled exceptions have been created to give some flexibility. For example, once a week, a crew can have a 2 hour extension of duty time (3 if there are 3 or more pilots) in order to deal with issues beyond the control of the airline. So they’re addressing summer thunderstorms and long delays, right? Nope.
Carriers should anticipate thunderstorms in many parts of the United States during the summer months. Likewise, heavy snow in the northern parts of the country should be anticipated during the winter, and the jet stream follows basic seasonal patterns. By the same token, carriers are not responsible for traffic delays; however, if they are operating out of chronically delayed airports, air traffic delays are clearly foreseeable.
Well that’s crap. I mean, yes, snow and storms happen during the summer, but they don’t happen every hour of every day. So why should airlines schedule so conservatively? They shouldn’t, but that doesn’t fly with the FAA proposal.
There is a lot more in here including a whole slew of discussion about pilots that are on reserve, or standing by to be used if necessary without having a flight scheduled in advance. There is also, finally, going to be 5 hours of initial and 2 hours of annual recurrent training on fatigue and how it effects pilots. There is none required today, so this is great.
In the end, this rule is probably not going to have a huge effect on the big guys because they already are closer to these new rules thanks to union contracts. Still, there will be pieces that the pilots or the airlines won’t like. It will probably have the biggest impact on some of the regional airlines out there with less strict rules. But that’s a good thing.",0.9544857740402222,1540,1.7557791471481323

How is the new program different from Support-A-Creator (SAC)? What happens to Support-A-Creator?
The Support-A-Creator program is returning to its roots as an affiliate marketing program for streamers and social media content creators. The SAC affiliate program is still available to those who meet its requirements. We've removed the Support-A-Creator device from Fortnite Creative and all published islands as part of this change.
Engagement payouts are specifically designed to reward island creators who make great content using the Unreal Editor for Fortnite and Fortnite Creative tools. Unlike SAC, engagement payouts do not require code entries to reward creator success, and players support island creators simply by playing the experiences they already enjoy.
Do I need to remove the Support-A-Creator device or my Support-A-Creator code from my island?
We've removed all Support-A-Creator devices automatically. You don't have to take action to remove it, but should consider adjusting your islands accordingly.
The pre-match UI that allows players to quickly lock in a creator code has also been removed, with no action required from creators.
Creators are no longer allowed to promote SAC creator codes within their islands, so that island creators and social media creators each have an independent channel to profit from engagement and are incentivized to work together, rather than competing to convince players to enter their codes. Any new or updated islands will be required to remove mention of SAC creator codes starting March 22, 2023.
With the removal of the Support-A-Creator device from islands, creators should reconsider player experiences that may no longer be necessary, such as reducing or removing matchmaking lobbies and/or sending players into the islands directly.
What is Fortnite’s net revenue? How is the 40% calculated?
All real money Fortnite purchases like V-Bucks Packs, retail V-Bucks gift cards, real money transactions like Starter Packs or Quest Packs, Fortnite Crew subscriptions, or other real-money offers contribute to Fortnite gross revenue.
When Fortnite offers are sold by third-parties, Fortnite net revenue is the funds received by Epic after third-party platform payment processing markups and fees are deducted by Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, Samsung, and other sellers of Fortnite offers. Other direct costs of goods sold, such as gift card manufacturing costs, are also deducted.
When Epic processes payments directly, such as the Epic Games Store on Windows and Android devices, Fortnite net revenue is the funds received by Epic after third-party credit-card, PayPal, and similar payment processing fees are deducted by payment service providers.
Once the month’s net revenue has been determined, 40% is sent to eligible island publishers, and the remaining 60% funds Fortnite ecosystem development by Epic.
Fortnite ecosystem costs include the creation of Fortnite’s codebase via software authorship, maintenance, service development and content design; all Fortnite brand game art, Item Shop cosmetic content, third-party IP licensing fees and merchandising; IT, hosting, and liveops server infrastructure/staffing; player acquisition, marketing, community management, and distribution; customer support and content moderation; Support-A-Creator affiliate payments.

"Yuvraj Singh, the former Indian cricketer and World Cup hero, praised Rinku Singh for his outstanding performances in T20 cricket. Yuvraj considers Rinku Singh as the top left-handed batter in India right now, comparing his playing style to his own. In the recent T20Is, India has experimented with various left-handed batsmen, including Rinku Singh, Tilak Varma, and Shivam Dube. In the first T20I against Afghanistan on January 11 in Mohali, these players featured in India’s top six, contributing to a six-wicket victory.
Rinku Singh has continued his excellent form from the IPL 2023 season to international cricket. With a stunning strike rate of 180.52 and an outstanding average of 69.50, he has scored 278 runs in nine innings.
Yuvraj Singh Commends Rinku Singh’s Excellent Performances
Yuvraj Singh emphasized Rinku Singh’s capacity for critical decision-making under duress in a recent interview. Yuvraj is confident in Rinku’s potential as a match-winner and reliable finisher, especially at the No. 5 or 6 positions.
“He’s probably the best left-hander in the Indian squad right now. He reminds me of myself – he knows when to attack when to rotate strike, and he’s incredibly smart under pressure,”
He added: “He can win us matches. I don’t want to put pressure on him, but I truly believe he has the skill to do what I used to – to be the finisher who delivers at No.5 or 6,”
Yuvraj Singh, with almost 12,000 international runs and 17 centuries in his impressive career, played a key role in India’s successful 2011 ODI World Cup campaign, earning him the Player of the Tournament award.He also played a significant role in India’s 2007 T20 World Cup triumph.

"Here are a few more responses that have come in on the topic above.
Peace and Joy!
Ed – I don’t think the problem is praying “God bless America”. I think the issue is that the phrase has become so hackneyed it is no longer prayer. And, perhaps worse, we have forgotten that, as prayer, we are really asking God to bless us so that God will use us to be blessings for others. Instead, the mantra seems to be that we are reminding God that we deserve His blessing because we are the exceptional ones.John Mundinger
I’m very grateful you continue to edit and write Thursday Theology. The substance is almost always enlightening, and the form – a message from you – always generates memories of the more than 40 years you have taught, scolded, and inspired me.I do read the postings – after converting them to a Word document and printing them out on paper. And I think about them. Here are my thoughts about Matthew 4:12-23 and President Obama’s “God bless America.”
As I’ve been studying Matthew’s Gospel the last few months, I’ve come to see that the writer is reminding his audience that God is creating a New People (as evident in the genealogy – a genesis, if you will) with a New King, a servant king who gives up his life as a ransom for many. This new servant king is leading a new exodus (Matthew 2) and is God’s “fresh growth” or new branch from the tree cut down.
Perhaps this is good news that could lift the spirits of at least some Americans, a promise of a different kind of blessing for ourselves and others.
With Matthew’s first readers, we Americans share a sense of dislocation. The Twin Towers – and other versions of our Jerusalem temple – have been destroyed. Like Matthew’s leaders, many have been forced to move to Galilee and other physical and emotional places. Lost jobs, lost homes, and lost friends. Some of us feel oppressed by Pharisaic “Tea Party-ers.” The shadow of death – especially as our entire population ages – casts a pall over our society.
But in Matthew’s Gospel, it’s exactly in Galilee where Jesus does his teaching and healing. Those regions that, in Isaiah’s time, first experienced God’s abandonment are now the first to participate in God’s new reign of mercy and forgiveness. Isn’t it possible that such mercy and forgiveness – Jesus’ promise from the cross to his fellow criminal and the promise of Jesus at the very end of Matthew’s Gospel, “I am with you until the end of the age” – would be enough to make us a “great people” however the global economy shakes out?
Thanks for encouraging me to put these thoughts on paper.

Ed,I fear you may have misinterpreted the question I shouted out during your probing of Jim about whether the F-16s he helps to fashion are God’s F-16s. The point was not at all to spring him from a D-3 morass but rather to exacerbate it. (I should have clarified on the spot, yes.) For doesn’t the terror and wrath of D-3 arise precisely from understanding that there’s no out whatsoever, not even the one that says “OK, I’ll quit my high-paying instrument-of-death job and go work in a soup kitchen instead?” Time was when the guys most to be pitied were the ones who churned out chariots for Nineveh and Babylon.
On the one hand they’re making the very tools God will use to carry out his judgment, so that in making them they’re serving God. On the other hand they’ll catch it in the neck for the devastation and murder that their chariots cause, woe being unto Nineveh and Babylon for their pride and cruelty. In other words, judgment if you do, judgment if you don’t, with wrath and gnashing of teeth at God for the bind he puts you in.
Isn’t that what Jim and his co-workers face, and not just them but all of us who are caught up in the empire’s service these days, if only as taxpayers? Judgment if the army you help to underwrite gets used. Judgment too if it doesn’t get used.
It would have been interesting indeed to hear Jim ruminate along such lines.
Ed, I don’t know if I caught either what Jerry’s meaning was that day, but his clarification makes sense to me.In a way, he did capture my dilemma — a dilemma I haven’t been all that aware of. I think my stated lack of pacifism lends itself to this. Those F-16s may well be God’s F-16s. That is not at all inconceivable to me. There is evil in the world, and while the war machine is not the solution to evil, it conceivably is God’s method for restraining evil.
The other horn of the dilemma of course, as Jerry pointed out, is that it is extremely hard for us to use God’s F-16s and other weapons without doing evil ourselves. I have no illusion that the F-16s will never, in the hands of those whose training my software expertise contributes to, be used to flatten villages or suppress dissent. It pains me deeply to confess that if any of these F-16s fall into the hands of Israel, innocent Palestinian lives will probably suffer at some point in time. It pains me not only on behalf of those Palestinian lives (and livelihoods), but also on behalf of Israel, a country I fear is plunging into an abyss. You want to see a people with a terrible dilemma on their hands, it’s Israel.
My dilemma seems like a walk in the park by comparison. God’s chosen people feeling a sense of duty to protect what Yahweh gave to them feeling that they have to do so by killing their bitter enemies, the descendants of Ishmael — between a rock and hard place is what I would call it. A people participating in their own moral destruction, feeling like they have no choice in the matter, having to rationalize it in order to sleep at night.
I guess in a small way I have to do the same. As I think I stated to you during an intermission that day, as much as I hate the destruction of war, the last thing I’m interested in is building powerfully destructive flying machines and then failing to train those who fly them properly. Either F-16s are purely instruments of evil, completely abhorrent to God and he will send people to destroy them, or else he calls people to fly those F-16s, and he calls people like me to support those who train pilots to fly them, so that they know how to fly them safely — perhaps even to fly and operate them so that only those who deserve it feel their “godly” wrath.
It’s a muddle. I definitely feel that this world contains people and organizations that need to be restrained physically, else the world shall fall into the abyss (I think I’m grabbing that word from Bonhoeffer’s Ethics, but I’m not sure). I’m definitely thinking of his reference to 2nd Thessalonians and Paul’s explanation of “the one who now restrains” the mystery of lawlessness. I think this world is still haunted by that scenario, and while I have little faith in any government’s (including our own) integrity to use that restraining power properly, I don’t feel that taking that power away is going to make things better, unless there is a godly force to give it to (and that kind of talk conjures up all kinds of ugly, perverted images of the Christian paramilitary variety anyway).
What is worrisome to me — now that you’ve got me dwelling on this — is that I don’t really have much confidence that this divine authority (Paul called it the sword in Romans 13, I believe) is in the hands of faithful servants. Bonhoeffer teaches us that such authority can be abdicated, at which point it becomes the responsibility of those called to try their best to take it from the government. The only example I’m aware of, as you may recall, still involved the participation of military types leading duplicitous lives — and of course they were ultimately unsuccessful.
So, while I cannot support fashioning an ideological opposition to F-16s, neither can I offer a feeling of confidence that F-16s will keep the world safe. They *can* keep the world safe, but will they? And I’m not simply asking if F-16s are “enough.” I’m afraid they might be subverted into instruments of evil. I also cannot offer any assurances that I am equipped to assess these possibilities and know whether or not to act. It is frankly easier to just blindly do my job responsibly and “trust” that the F-16s will be put to noble use, though the object of that “trust” is not necessarily worthy of it.
Yours in Christ,",0.9675403237342834,1990,1.5685685873031616

In the ever-volatile crypto market, VeChain (VET) has emerged as a resilient player, defying odds and maintaining stability amidst turbulent times. While 2021 posed its challenges, VeChain has steadily expanded its network and garnered attention from analysts who foresee potential growth on the horizon.
Stability Amidst Volatility

Analysts like Ali Martinez are turning to VeChain’s historical performance for insights into its future trajectory.

"- Bitcoin breaks past key resistance levels, surpassing the 2015-2018 cycle’s high points.
- Institutional adoption and macroeconomic trends drive Bitcoin’s momentum toward a $100K target.
Bitcoin [BTC] has surged past a critical price milestone — surpassing key resistance levels that previously defined its cyclical behavior during the 2015-2018 bull market.
This latest breakout highlights the cryptocurrency’s resilience and growing maturity in a market that has evolved significantly since its early speculative days.
Unlike the dramatic peaks and valleys of the 2015-2018 cycle, Bitcoin’s current trajectory appears more measured, underpinned by stronger fundamentals and broader adoption.
With its price now exceeding levels that many believed would act as insurmountable resistance, questions arise about whether this surge marks the beginning of a new bull cycle — or even a run toward a six-figure valuation.
Breaking past historical cycles
Bitcoin’s current cycle is progressing faster than its 2015-2018 counterpart. After peaking at $20,000 in 2017, Bitcoin took nearly three years to recover, consolidating at lower levels before its next bull run.
In contrast, the 2022 bottom has been followed by a much quicker rebound, with Bitcoin surpassing $50,000 within two years — nearly a year faster than the previous recovery.
The chart shows Bitcoin maintaining momentum, with monthly RSI readings above 75 signaling strong bullish conditions.
Trading volumes have also exceeded those from the earlier cycle, reflecting increased market participation.
This milestone represents an 80% recovery from 2022 lows, supported by long-term holder accumulation and reduced exchange balances.
These on-chain shifts highlight stronger fundamentals compared to prior cycles, suggesting less speculative activity and more sustained growth. Bitcoin’s accelerated recovery sets it apart from historical patterns.",0.9219961762428284,367,1.3017867803573608
"Effects of Climate Change on Canadian Forest Fires

This study aimed to determine the effects of climate change on forest fire trends in Canada by measuring correlations between weather conditions and the frequency and size of forest fires. Upon identifying the correlations, a model was created to understand future forest fire trends. The purpose of this study was to prevent the increasing trend of forest fires and devise solutions to reduce their damages. The data obtained from the Canadian National Fire Database underwent a linear regression and a machine learning algorithm to respectively predict and correlate weather conditions with future forest fire trends. It was concluded that temperature and wind speed experienced a positive correlation with forest fire frequency and size and precipitation experienced a negative correlation. To reduce the harmful effects of forest fires, cloud seeding can be used to create more precipitation and wind farms can be built to lower wind speed and attract lightning. However, more research and stricter policies directly targeting climate change are necessary for long term stability or decrease in forest fire trends.",0.9099324345588684,220,3.281123161315918

What is the formal dispute resolution process?
The formal dispute resolution process (FDR) was created by FDA to provide a means for resolving disagreements between FDA reviewers and a company that has submitted an application for a new drug. Because a wide variety of complex and important scientific or medical issues may come up in the review process, FDA designed the FDR to allow senior FDA management to engage in an open, prompt discussion of disputes between the sponsor and the review division. There is a draft guidance document from FDA that establishes the framework for the FDR process, and which sets specific timeline goals for appeals. If sponsors are not satisfied with a decision after appeal, they may appeal again to the next level of FDA management, potentially all the way up to the Commissioner of the FDA. FDA officials have publicly suggested that the FDR process is the appropriate regulatory path for sponsors when disagreements about refusal-to-file decisions arise.",0.9618803858757019,448,1.9223790168762207

"The essential elements required to sustain an action for deceit and false representation are that the representation was made as a statement of fact; that it was untrue, and known to be untrue by the party making it; that it was made for the purpose of inducing the other party to act upon it; and that the party to whom the representation was made was made was in fact induced thereby to act to his injury. The absence of any one of these statements is fatal to a recovery. The defendant, a real-estate broker, negotiating with the plaintiff as a prospective purchaser for the sale of real estate, represented to him that the owner would not take less than a certain sum. The plaintiff purchased at the price named, and thereupon the defendant represented to his principal that he had sold at a much lower price, and retained the difference for his own use. It was apparent from the facts and circumstances appearing in the record that the defendant, at the time he made the representation as to the lowest price, could not have known that it was untrue. Held: — 1. That if the defendant's retention of a part of the purchase price was wrongful, only the owner was harmed thereby. 2. That in the absence of knowledge on the part of the defendant that his statement as to the owner's lowest price was untrue, such statement was entirely speculative and conjectural, and could not be made the basis of an action of deceit. The law does not fasten responsibility upon one for an expression of opinion as to matters which in their nature are uncertain and contingent. The Superior Court found that the plaintiff did not rely upon the statements of the defendant in making the purchase of this real estate, but ""relied upon his own judgment as to the value of the land and believed it was worth what he paid, basing his judgment on such investigations as he cared to make."" Held that, under such circumstances, the defendant's alleged deceptions never influenced the plaintiff to purchase.
Argued June 6th, 1912
Decided July 26th, 1912.
ACTION against a real-estate broker for deceit in the sale of land, brought to and tried by the Superior Court in New Haven County, Curtis, J.; facts found and judgment rendered for the defendant, and appeal by the plaintiff. No error.
Henry G. Newton and Ward Church, for the appellant (plaintiff).
Carl A. Mears, for the appellee (defendant).
The complaint describes two distinct causes of action in two counts. The first count alleges that the defendant made false representations to the plaintiff in connection with the sale of land in West Haven, hereinafter called the ""first piece."" The second count sets forth an alleged cause of action of a similar character, founded upon the sale of another tract of land in West Haven, designated as the ""second piece."" These sales were made on different dates.
The facts of the case, as far as necessary to present the questions involved, are as follows: In September, 1909, the plaintiff, a retired business man, was well acquainted with the defendant and had confidence in his statements. The defendant was a real-estate broker in the city of New Haven. This land, which was owned by the Union Savings Bank of Danbury, was placed with the defendant for sale ""at the best price obtainable."" The ordinary commission for the sale of property of this kind was five per cent. The plaintiff made a careful examination of the property, and was told by the defendant that $5,000 was the price of the first piece. Later the plaintiff asked the defendant if $5,000 was the lowest price for the first piece, and the defendant said it was. At that time the lowest price had not been fixed by the owner. The fair market value of the first piece at this time was about $4,500. It was in fact Oviatt's opinion that he could get $5,000 for the property. The broker then wired the bank that the first piece had been sold for $4,000 net to the bank. The bank ratified the sale, and it was consummated on these terms. Oviatt retained $1,000 as his commission in connection with this sale. In the meantime, the plaintiff was considering the purchase of the second piece at $7,000. The defendant, without communicating with the bank, informed the plaintiff that the lowest price for this property was $7,000. The plaintiff then offered $7,000 for the second piece, and the defendant accepted the offer. The broker then informed the bank that he had sold the second piece for $5,750 net. The bank accepted the offer, and the defendant retained for his own use $1,250 on account of the sale of the second piece.
The market value of the second piece in 1909 was about $6,000. The plaintiff first learned the amount the defendant had personally received out of these sales in the fall of 1911. The bank at this time first ascertained the facts as to these transactions. Oviatt believed that the plaintiff would pay $7,000 for the second piece, and did not ask the bank to state its lowest price, but stated to Bradley that $7,000 was the bank's lowest price. ""Mr. Bradley had ample time and opportunity to examine the premises and did examine them thoroughly, and he had ample time and opportunity to examine as to their market value. He was an experienced and successful business man, and accustomed to dealing in real estate with a view to reselling it, and owned some real estate in West Haven, and he relied upon his own judgment as to the value of the land and believed it was worth what he paid, basing his judgment on such investigation as he cared to make.""
The alleged false representations set forth in the first count upon which the plaintiff relies were as follows: ""The representations that a cash offer of $4,750 had been made for said land and that there was a ready sale for said land at an advance over $5,000, and that the lowest price of said The Union Savings Bank of Danbury for said land was $5,000, were each of them untrue, and were known to the defendant to be untrue, were made as statements of fact, and were made with intent to deceive plaintiff and to induce him to purchase said land at the price of $5,000; and plaintiff was thereby induced to act to his injury, as hereinafter appears.""
In the second count the plaintiff in part based his cause of action upon the following allegations: ""Said representations that the lowest price at which said The Union Savings Bank of Danbury would sell said land was $7,000, and that there was a ready sale of said land at an advance over $7,000, were each of them untrue, and were known to the defendant to be untrue, were made as statements of fact, and were made with intent to deceive plaintiff and to induce him to purchase said property at the price of $7,000; and plaintiff was thereby induced to act to his injury.""
None of the specifications of fraud, as set forth in the complaint, are found to be true, except the one relating to the lowest market price that the bank would take for its property.
Upon the facts found, the trial court held that the plaintiff had no cause of action against the defendant. The plaintiff appeals. There is but one question fairly presented by the appeal, which relates to the representations set forth in both counts of the complaint as to the lowest prices which the bank would take for the two pieces of land.
To justify an allegation of fraud in making these statements, it was necessary for the plaintiff to show that the defendant had knowledge at the time that these statements were made that they were untrue. From the facts and circumstances appearing in the record, it is apparent that such knowledge was impossible. The defendant did not know, at the time the representations were made, the ultimatum of the bank as to the ""lowest prices"" it would take. This could not be ascertained until further investigation. Until then, statements made by the defendant would have been entirely speculative and conjectural. His instructions were to sell the property ""at the best price obtainable."" As an agent of the bank, it was his duty to get all that he could for the property. If, by subsequent developments, it appeared that he obtained the best prices obtainable, and then deceived the bank and wrongfully retained a portion of the price, this is a matter which concerned the bank, and not the plaintiff.
It is plain that this property would not have been worth any more if the alleged representations of the defendant as to the lowest price which the bank would take for its property were true. The representations can only be taken as expressions of the vendor's estimate of the value of its property. The law does not fasten responsibility upon one for expression of opinion as to matters which, in their nature, are contingent and uncertain. People's Savings Bank v. James, 178 Mass. 322, 59 N.E. 807; Randall v. Farnum, 52 Vt. 539, 542.
The essential elements required to sustain an action for deceit and false representation are that the representation was made as a statement of fact; that it was untrue, and known to be untrue by the party making it; that it was made for the purpose of inducing the other party to act upon it; and that the party to whom the representation was made was in fact induced thereby to act to his injury. All of these ingredients must be found to exist; and the absence of any one of them is fatal to a recovery. Barnes v. Starr, 64 Conn. 136, 150, 28 A. 980.
The Superior Court, after finding specifically as to the various facts surrounding these sales, in substance finds that the plaintiff did not rely upon the statements of the defendant in making the purchase of this real estate, but ""relied upon his own judgment as to the value of the land and believed it was worth what he paid, basing his judgment on such investigations as he cared to make."" Under such circumstances, the defendant's alleged deceptions never influenced the plaintiff to purchase.",0.9895309209823608,2082,1.5099411010742188

"The global hip replacement implants market was valued at approximately US$ 7.0 Bn in 2017. It is projected to register a cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 3.5% from 2018 to 2026, according to a new report published by Transparency Market Research (TMR) titled ‘Hip Replacement Implants Market – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast, 2018–2026.’ Expansion of the health care industry, government initiatives, increase in health care expenditure, rise in product approvals, and increase in the patient population are projected to augment the global market from 2018 to 2026. As key players introduce their new hip replacement implants in developed regions such a North America and Western Europe, these regions are likely to account for a dominating share of the global hip replacement implants market.

Rise in Demand for Hip Replacement Surgeries across the Globe to Propel Market
Global demand for hip replacement is increasing, primarily due to a rise in clinical education among patients, increase in demand among the geriatric population, and rise in the prevalence of obesity and arthritis. The U.S. has witnessed a significant rise in demand for new hip surgeries from 89,919 surgeries in 2004 to 122,154 in 2015. Advancements in minimally invasive surgeries and 3D printing have fueled the global hip replacement market.
Improvement in Government-initiated Hip Implant Reforms
Government bodies of several countries are undertaking collaborative initiatives to meet the demand for hip implants. For instance, in 2013, Medicare spent about US$ 7 Bn on hospitalizations alone for hip and knee replacements. Moreover, 255 of 400,000 such surgeries performed annually are likely to be covered by the new payment model of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in the near future.
Increase in the Incidence of Trauma/Accidental Injuries
The incidence of accidental injuries and hip fractures has increased significantly in the last decade. Over 340,000 hip implant procedures are performed in the U.S. and 600,000 are performed globally each year. This includes several patients aged between 40 and 50, who are focused on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Increase in the number of hip-related accidents and other hip bone disorders, such as joint pain, instability in the hip joint, bone loss, and infection, are anticipated to boost the global hip replacement market during the forecast period.

High Cost of Hip Implants and Surgery to Restrain Market
Globally, patients are facing several distinct challenges, including implants costs, health care reform implementation, and reimbursement rates. Low affordability due to high costs and low access to new custom hip implant procedures in countries in Asia Pacific and Middle East & Africa are key factors hampering the hip replacement implants market in these regions. The cost of procedure ranges from US$ 44,816 to US$ 16,000 per person, depending on the region, material, and type.
Asia Pacific Market to Expand Significantly
In terms of revenue, the hip replacement implants market in Asia Pacific is projected to expand at a CAGR of over 4.0% during the forecast period. Expanding economies in Asia Pacific offer significant opportunities to hip replacement implants manufacturers. Emerging countries such as India, China, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa have a large number of underserved patients. The disposable income of people in India, China, Mexico, Brazil, and other countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa has increased due to economic growth. This has boosted their purchasing power. Companies manufacturing hip replacement implants should explore new emerging countries, especially in Asia, as their population is high, which translates to a large patient base.
Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, and Stryker Company to Lead Market
The report also provides profiles of leading players operating in the global hip replacement implants market. They include Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc., MicroPort Scientific Corporation, Exactech Inc., OMNIlife Science Inc., Stryker Corporation, B. Braun Melsungen AG, and DJO Global Inc.

"Four of Santa Barbara’s trail organizations have collaborated to form the Santa Barbara Outdoor Volunteers program for local residents to collectively organize trail maintenance projects throughout the county.
The Santa Barbara Trails Council, Santa Barbara Mountain Bike Trail Volunteers, Los Padres Forest Association and Santa Barbara County Outdoor Foundation combined forces to provide the county with a volunteer program that will enhance trails and other recreational facilities extending from the UCSB campus to Figueroa Mountain. The Outdoor Volunteers program will use the social networking site Meetup to organize volunteer events and inform the community about the group’s other preservation efforts.
According to SBMTV President Chris Orr, volunteers are vital due to the lack of funds and other resources for the preservation of public parks in Santa Barbara.
“There are monthly trail work events between the four or five organizations — about two to three events per month,” Orr said. “For years, we’ve been trying to put together some kind of umbrella organization, a way to bring volunteers from the different groups and community together.”
In the past, UCSB’s Associated Students has organized groups of student volunteers for many of these local programs, Orr said.
SBTC Executive Director Ray Ford said the site will give community members a medium to share information and discuss plans for improving the region’s trails.
“One of the really cool things about the Meetup concept is that it isn’t just about the projects themselves; it’s about building a social organization, whereby the members can add their own pictures and stories about the projects, discuss issues and suggest their own activities,” Ford said in a press release. “Think about what we can do if we all band together to improve every aspect of our local outdoor environment.”
The Santa Barbara Outdoor Volunteers Program reflects the community’s history in pushing the boundaries of ecological progress, according to Ford.
“Santa Barbarans love to help take care of our local environment,” Ford said in a press release. “We want to make it easy to know when events are happening and for event leaders to coordinate projects.”
Jasonn Beckstrand, a member of the Los Padres Forest Association, said the volunteer program will provide the community with a variety of events that are not all strictly work-based.
“It’s a great way to find out about different activities going on throughout the county — not just trail maintenance,” Beckstrand said. “We all do interpretive events all the way through fun, backcountry, week-long vacation trips.”
Third-year biology major and Excursion Club member Michael Winter said the program will help care for local recreational facilities in need of maintenance.
“It sounds like a great opportunity,” Winter said. “Santa Barbara is such a beautiful place and so many people take that for granted. I’ve been on a few trails in the past that were a bit haggard and cared for improperly, so I think this could be a really awesome way to help with habitat preservation.”

"Migration policy, ‘influencers’, and social media have all been identified as contributing factors to recent nationwide riots, according to a new survey.
Two-thirds of Britons believe that the country’s immigration policy played a significant role in the recent wave of riots, as revealed by a poll published on Sunday.
The unrest led to a widespread crackdown on disorder and online dissent across the nation. The riots erupted after a teenager of Rwandan descent fatally stabbed three children and injured ten others in Southport, near Liverpool. The protests quickly escalated into broader anti-immigration demonstrations, culminating in an arson attack on a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham.
A survey conducted by Savanta, involving 2,237 participants, found that 82% of respondents held the rioters responsible for the unrest, with 75% attributing blame to certain groups and influencers. However, 64% believe that the UK’s immigration policy is the root cause of the crisis, while 59% pointed to the Southport stabbings as the trigger.
44% blamed PM Keir Starmer for the riots.
The British government responded with a draconian crackdown, leading to over 1,000 arrests, 480 charges, and 99 sentences, with additional actions taken against individuals for online activities. The survey also revealed a divided public opinion on the government’s handling of the situation, with nearly half approving and a significant portion criticising the response.",0.9561449289321899,295,1.7971761226654053
"In a highly complex and volatile business environment, growing expectations of talent from companies, availability of plethora of opportunities for talent, battle for talent is becoming extremely difficult.
Companies are investing heavily on talent to build future leaders across levels. Those with strong commitment towards developing leaders, structured talent development processes and robust execution have significant competitive advantage over others.
At GTFL, we believe that there is immense potential in people and if provided with the right environment, resources and opportunities they thrive and deliver exceptional results. We have a series of initiatives around developing leaders from within, few of our high impact interventions are:
- Right Person on Right Role (RPoRR) – RPoRR initiative aims to develop leaders, we identify critical leadership roles and potential leaders, assess their development areas through various assessments, stakeholders feedbacks and observations. Top team invests lot of time with talent to arrive at the development plans which are periodically reviewed. The developmental competencies are strengthened through on the job projects, cross functional projects, stretch assignments, coaching (internal /external), mentoring by seniors, external training programs, sponsored education, exposure to overseas markets and customers, presentations in conferences, opportunity to shadow other leaders etc.
- Individual Development Plan (IDP) – Junior and Middle management employees who are Hi performers, Hi potential and critical talent undergo IDP initiative. It starts with identifying the areas where they need to be developed (technical and behavioural) through past performance feedbacks and competency gaps, inputs from various instruments, 360 feedback, etc. and planning series of interventions to build the talent further on those areas.
- Human Process Labs Program: Human Process Labs aims to create safe space for individuals where they can re-explore themselves, know more about themselves, understand why they are the way they are, how they interact with others and how they can further enhance their effectiveness in personal and professional lives, share their limiting emotions and beliefs. This awareness enables them to be more effective at personal and professional front both. While it’s a self-exploratory session, we also talk about “System Interface” which is specifically about “I vs others” or “I vs Team”. Few perspectives about- how do we see myself when in connection with team vis a vis how do I perceive team when I am in need to work with them. These perspectives gives a lot of introspection and lead to some desired changes to participant’s behaviour.
We strongly believe that our signature programs and various other initiatives around investing in leaders at all levels, will keep us competitive and on track in the journey of enhancing human capital. These are crucial for our long-term success and sustainable growth and will go a long way in strengthening GTFL culture, building a workforce which is agile, adapts well, thinks new and novel, innovates and supports the company to achieve long-term success.

"Evolving Landscape of Employment Sector
In the last decade, the job search process has undergone a significant transformation due to the rise of digital platforms. Today, job seekers and companies alike leverage these platforms for efficient recruitment and application processes. Companies utilize various methods, including inbound and outbound applications, to connect with potential candidates.
Inbound methods involve job seekers applying directly to job postings on platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor. These platforms allow individuals to explore numerous job opportunities and submit applications tailored to specific roles. On the other hand, outbound methods include companies reaching out to candidates through recruitment agencies, job portals, and even social media. This approach enables employers to proactively identify and engage with suitable candidates, expanding their reach beyond traditional job postings.
The digitalization of the job market has also led to a shift in employment dynamics. Job opportunities are now less constrained by geographic locations or rigid hours, thanks to technological advancements. For instance, platforms like Amazon Flex offer a flexible approach to traditional driving roles, allowing individuals to work on their own schedules. This evolution reflects a broader trend towards more diverse and adaptable employment opportunities.

The Nitty-Gritty of Vehicle Operating Employment

Long-haul truck drivers, on the other hand, transport goods over long distances, often requiring extended periods on the road.
Qualifications for driver jobs generally include a valid driver's license, a clean driving record, and good physical health. For positions like Walmart drivers, additional requirements include a commercial driver's license with at least 30 months of recent experience. Some companies offer training programs to help candidates acquire the necessary skills, while others, such as Amazon Flex, have specific requirements like a mid-sized or larger vehicle and adequate insurance.
Decoding the Eligibility for Vehicle Operating Designations
Understanding the eligibility criteria for different vehicle operating designations is crucial for aspiring drivers. Common requirements include:
- 21 years of age or older: Most driver jobs require applicants to be at least 21 years old.
- Valid driver's license: The type of license needed varies by job; for example, heavy vehicle operators often need a commercial driver's license.

The Role of Training and Certifications
In the vehicle operating sector, training programs and certifications are pivotal in enhancing your employability and career prospects. These educational opportunities not only equip you with essential skills but also underscore your dedication to the profession, making you a more attractive candidate to potential employers.
Training Programs: Engaging in specialized training programs can provide a solid foundation in various aspects of vehicle operation. For instance, defensive driving courses teach techniques to prevent accidents and handle hazardous situations, boosting safety and reducing insurance costs for employers.

Such credentials validate your competence and can be particularly valuable in competitive job markets.
Listing Data: To maximize the impact of your resume, include a detailed listing of your relevant training and certifications. Highlight courses that are directly applicable to the job you’re seeking. For instance:
- Defensive Driving Course – Focuses on accident prevention and safe driving techniques.
- Advanced Heavy Vehicle Operation – Covers the operation of large vehicles and advanced maneuvering skills.
- Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) – Essential for operating commercial trucks and other heavy vehicles.
- First Aid and Emergency Response – Provides skills for handling emergencies on the road.
Including these details demonstrates your commitment to the field and readiness to handle various challenges, making you a valuable asset to potential employers.
The Work Environment in the Vehicle Operating Industry
The vehicle operating industry presents a unique work environment characterized by long hours and significant time spent on the road. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone considering a career in this field.
Long Hours and Productivity: Driver jobs often require extended periods of time on the road. According to Everhour, productivity typically peaks at around 40 hours per week. Beyond this threshold, productivity tends to decline due to fatigue and extended working hours. This is a common challenge in the industry, where drivers frequently face the risk of burnout from sustained periods of high activity.
Challenges of Work-Life Balance: Statistics from Hubstaff indicate that many workers in the vehicle operating sector are considered “workaholics.” The demanding nature of the job can lead to skipped meals and irregular eating habits, as drivers may struggle to find time for breaks. This highlights the difficulties in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, a significant concern for those in the industry.
Trends Toward Flexible Work Arrangements: In response to these challenges, there is a growing trend towards more flexible work arrangements. For example, Amazon Flex drivers work as independent contractors, allowing them to set their own schedules. This flexibility helps drivers manage their work-life balance better by enabling them to choose hours that fit their personal needs and preferences. Such models are becoming increasingly popular, reflecting a shift towards improved working conditions in the vehicle operating industry.
By recognizing these aspects of the work environment, prospective drivers can better prepare for the demands of the job and seek opportunities that offer greater flexibility and balance.
The Compensation Structure
The compensation structure for driver jobs varies widely. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly earnings of full-time workers were $1,143 in the second quarter of 2024. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the national average salary in the U.S. in Q4 of 2023 was $59,384.
Driver compensation extends beyond hourly wages and salaries. Some companies offer fringe benefits like health insurance and retirement plans, while others, such as Amazon Flex, pay per delivery, allowing drivers to increase their earnings by completing additional deliveries. Factors such as experience, location, and company pay structure significantly impact a driver's overall earnings.",0.9338008165359497,2050,1.948602318763733

""The venue and the vivacious crowd were great,"" said Christina Dandar with Young Texans Against Cancer. ""I really enjoyed learning more about the charity partners, too.""
Although the event was scheduled from 6-8 pm, these YP's were still going strong when the event was technically finished. Coveted swagbag's filled with goodies from — Aftershock London, Lombardi Family Concepts, Rye 51: Textile Distillery, Sprinkles Cupcakes, The Hair Bar and Q Clothier — were the only real incentive for folks to finally say goodbye.",0.9518985152244568,409,1.014504075050354

Philanthropic fashion plates flood Forty Five Ten for Gray Malin mixer
Forty Five Ten is best known as a showplace for high fashion. But it also makes a pretty sweet art gallery, as owner Brian Bolke proved recently when he hosted Dallas photographer Gray Malin for a special event honoring Dallas Children’s Advocacy Center fundraiser Art for Advocacy.
Art enthusiasts — including Lynn McBee,Lynn M. Davis, Clark Knippers, Kersten Rettig, Elaine Agather, Julie Hawes, Krystal Schlegel, Chris Culak, Abi Ferrin, David Nichols and Erin Mathews — chatted eagerly with Malin, who is noted for his Prada Marfa and À La Plage, À La Piscine series.
“I got in touch with Forty Five Ten, and we brought together images from five different bodies of work,” Malin said. “I wanted to do a homecoming in the community that helped me get up and stand on my own two feet.”
Malin’s images, mixed with plenty of bubbles, tasty bites and hip beats from DJ Lucy Wrubel, made for a night that no self-respecting social butterfly would miss. Speaking of hard to miss, several of Malin’s well-known photographs adorned the store, and everything was for sale.
The most buzzed-about shots were those of the beach. Despite their popularity, Malin says his initial idea was to shoot pools. In fact, he discovered the beauty of the beach from above by accident.
According to Malin, he went from hotel to hotel in Miami, asking if he could shoot their pools; they turned him down time and time again. Not taking no for an answer, Malin decided the best way to shoot these pools was to rent a helicopter. So he did.
“As we were circling the pools, we would swing out over South Beach, and that is where I discovered the beauty of the beach from above,” Malin said. “It was really about the umbrellas and the chairs and the architectural patterns of them all.
“I got home, and the pool images were cool. But I knew that there was something special about the pictures of the beach.”
So what does the future hold for this Dallasite living out his dream in Los Angeles — and across the globe?
“I am starting a new project in Antarctica in December that I am really excited about,” he says. “We are in the process of getting ready for that. It’s an exciting new series that will allow me to go to continent number seven.”
The Art for Advocacy auction party, taking place Thursday, November 7, at F.I.G., raises funds to aid the Dallas Children’s Advocacy Center (DCAC) in its mission to improve the lives of abused children in Dallas County.
DCAC coordinates the investigation and prosecution of the most severe cases of child abuse in our community and provides national leadership on child abuse issues.",0.9723457098007202,648,1.03009831905365

"A good night’s sleep is essential for our overall well-being, and your mattress plays a crucial role in ensuring you get the rest you need. But how do you know when it’s time to replace your mattress? Here are some signs to look out for:
- Mattress Age: As a general rule of thumb, most mattresses have a lifespan of about 7-10 years. If your mattress is older than that, it might be time to start thinking about a replacement, even if it still looks okay on the outside.
- Visible Sagging or Lumps: If you notice sagging in the middle or lumps in your mattress, it can significantly impact your comfort and support while sleeping. These issues can lead to poor sleep quality and even back pain.
- You’re Waking up Stiff or Sore: If you consistently wake up feeling stiff, sore, or achy, it could be a sign that your mattress is no longer providing the support your body needs. A new mattress with proper support can help alleviate these issues.
- Your Allergies are Acting Up: Over time, mattresses can accumulate dust mites, allergens, and other particles that can trigger allergies or worsen existing respiratory conditions. If you find yourself sneezing or experiencing congestion more often while in bed, it might be time for a new mattress.
- Visible Wear and Tear: Check your mattress for any visible signs of wear and tear, such as fraying edges, broken springs, or noticeable indentations. These physical signs indicate that your mattress has reached the end of its lifespan.
- Changes in Lifestyle or Body: If you’ve gained or lost weight, experienced an injury, or undergone any major lifestyle changes, your mattress requirements may have changed as well. It’s essential to reassess if your current mattress still meets your needs.
- Partner Disturbance: Does your current mattress transfer motion easily? If you’re frequently disturbed by your partner’s movements during the night, it might be beneficial to upgrade to a mattress with better motion isolation properties.
Remember that investing in a new mattress is an investment in your health and well-being. A quality mattress can improve the quality of your sleep, alleviate aches and pains, and enhance your overall quality of life.
If you’re experiencing any of the signs mentioned above, it might be time to start researching for a new mattress that suits your preferences and needs. Visit us today to test different types of mattresses.
Prioritize your sleep health by recognizing when it’s time to say goodbye to your old mattress and welcome a new one that better meets your needs.",0.9287514686584473,556,1.5135530233383179

"It was a historic day for space exploration as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos took off on a joyride to the edge of space. The Blue Origin spacecraft carrying Bezos and three other crew members successfully blasted off from West Texas on July 20, 2021. This marked a major milestone for Bezos’ space company and a momentous occasion for space enthusiasts around the world. Let’s take a closer look at Jeff Bezos’ out-of-this-world adventure.
Blast Off! Jeff Bezos Soars to Space
The countdown was on as Bezos and his crew members prepared for their flight to space. After boarding the New Shepard spacecraft, they were strapped in and ready for launch. At T-minus zero, the rocket engines ignited, and the spacecraft lifted off the launchpad, soaring towards the heavens.
As the spacecraft climbed higher and higher, Bezos and his fellow crew members experienced weightlessness and breathtaking views of the Earth below. They reached an altitude of more than 62 miles, which is considered the edge of space. After a few minutes of floating in zero gravity, the crew members strapped back in for their descent back to Earth.
Amazon CEO’s Out-of-This-World Adventure
Jeff Bezos’ space adventure was not just a joyride, but a historic moment for Blue Origin and the space industry as a whole. Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000 with the goal of making space travel more accessible to people. He has invested billions of dollars in the company and has been working towards this moment for over two decades.
Bezos’ space flight also marks a significant step towards space tourism. Blue Origin plans to start offering commercial flights to space in the near future, with prices yet to be announced. This could open up a whole new world of opportunities for space exploration and could pave the way for more people to experience the wonder of space.
Jeff Bezos’ journey to space was an exhilarating experience, not just for him, but for people all around the world. It marks the beginning of a new era of commercial space travel and could potentially change the way we look at space exploration. As we celebrate this historic moment, we can only imagine what the future of space travel holds. Congratulations to Jeff Bezos and the Blue Origin team for their incredible achievement!
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently accomplished a lifelong dream: he became the first private citizen to take a trip to space. It was a joyride to remember, one that was the culmination of over a decade of hard work and dedication to space exploration.
It all started back in 2011, when Bezos founded a space exploration company named Blue Origin. His goal was to make space travel more accessible, and with this trip to space, that dream has been realized. On April 5th, Bezos and his brother Mark hopped aboard a rocket of his own design, completed the journey to space, circled the planet twice, and then safely returned to Earth in a capsule that was designed to land on water.
Bezos’s mission was inspiring to witness, and for many of us, it was a reminder of how powerful ambition and dedication can be. Not only did Bezos achieve a major milestone for space exploration, but he also showed us that with enough hard work and perseverance, anything is achievable.
This historic trip was one of the greatest feats ever to be accomplished by a private individual, and Bezos’s success is being widely celebrated. He has earned admiration from millions of people around the world, and his accomplishment has given us hope that space exploration can thrive even in the private sector.
Jeff Bezos has shown us what can be accomplished when the impossible is pursued with determination. We are proud to have witnessed his journey, and we look forward to seeing what new heights he will reach in the future.",0.9711267948150635,765,2.189852714538574
"The Role of Decentralized Apps in the Fight Against Climate Change.
Climate change is undoubtedly one of the biggest global challenges of our time. It is affecting every aspect of the planet, from the air we breathe to the food we eat. It has severe social, economic and environmental impacts, which calls for urgent action from individuals, communities, and organizations alike.
Interestingly, decentralized apps (dApps) have a crucial role to play in the fight against climate change. In this article, we'll explore how dApps can help in this global challenge, and why they are the perfect platform to drive real progress. Let's dive right in.
The Need for Decentralized Apps in Climate Change
First things first, what is a decentralized app? A dApp is an application that operates on a decentralized network, typically a blockchain. The decentralized nature of dApps means they operate on a peer-to-peer network, rather than being controlled by a single entity like a corporation or government. They are also immutable and transparent, meaning data on the network cannot be easily altered or deleted and are accountable and transparent.
Now, why do we need dApps in climate change?
For starters, centralization, as we know it, has been a barrier to sustainable development. It promotes the hoarding of resources, concentrated control of decision-making, and increased carbon footprint by entities that influence the top-down flow of resources. Decentralization, on the other hand, promotes equality, transparency, and freedom at every level.
Dapps are therefore ideal for empowering communities, increasing transparency in the carbon market, and promoting open and effective collaboration among individuals and groups from different sectors worldwide.
How DApps Can Help in Reducing Carbon Emissions
With the full potential of dApps unlocked, there are numerous ways this technology can help in the fight against climate change. Here are some top examples:
One of the most popular ways dApps are making a difference in climate change is through carbon credits. Carbon credits are tradable certificates that represent the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) or an equivalent quantity of a different greenhouse gas. The idea behind carbon credits is that they allow companies to offset their carbon emissions by buying credits from projects that reduce emissions.
DApps can provide a platform for transactions of carbon credits. Being hosted on a blockchain, they can help in the verification of carbon credits issuance and settlements, making it easy to confirm the authenticity of offsets.
Moreover, they can also help to build trust in the carbon credit market by providing verifiable and unalterable records showing the origin and authenticity of the carbon credit. DApps have the power to make carbon credits more transparent and accessible to individual investors.
Supply Chain Tracking
Another essential application of dApps in fighting climate change is through supply chain tracking. Supply chain tracking pertains to the monitoring of raw materials, production processes, logistics, and final distribution of goods across the supply chain.
Supply chains are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Through dApps, it can be possible to track the entire lifecycle of a product, from raw materials to recycling, and therefore determine the carbon footprint of each step in the production cycle.
Furthermore, decentralization can promote transparency at every level of the supply chain, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about the products they consume. By using dApps, customers can determine the environmental impact of a product by scanning a QR code and tracking its origin, production processes, consignments, and final destination.
Alternative energy is another essential application of dApps in reducing carbon emissions. Decentralized energy can be generated through solar, wind, or other renewable sources, making it more sustainable, reliable, and accessible to communities worldwide.
DApps can help in the development of alternative energy markets by facilitating peer-to-peer energy transactions. The decentralized network allows solar panel owners to sell excess energy to their neighbors, thus allowing everyone in the network to profit from renewable energy generation.
Conversely, consumers can also buy energy from their neighbors, bypassing conventional energy grids that are mainly dependent on fossil fuels. With dApps, everyone has a role to play in the production and distribution of energy, leading to a more equitable and sustainable society.
The potential of decentralized applications for fighting climate change is enormous. They provide a platform for reducing carbon emissions, increasing transparency and accountability, promoting renewable energy, and providing carbon offsetting solutions. Moreover, they open up market opportunities for the development of sustainable technologies and enable individuals to make informed decisions about the environmental impact of their actions.
As the world continues to grapple with climate change, decentralized applications may be the answer we’ve been searching for to save the planet.

"Decorating a room with brown walls can present unique challenges and opportunities for creativity.
Brown, as a neutral and warm tone, offers a rich backdrop that can evoke feelings of comfort and elegance. However, selecting the right decor, furniture, and accessories is crucial to enhance the beauty of the space and prevent it from feeling dark or heavy.
In this guide on how to decorate a room with brown walls, we will explore various strategies and tips to effectively decorate a room with brown walls, ensuring a harmonious and inviting atmosphere that reflects your personal style.
Why Choose Brown Walls?
Choosing brown walls for your space can provide numerous advantages. One of the primary benefits is the sense of warmth and coziness that brown tones bring, making a room feel inviting and comfortable. Brown also acts as a versatile backdrop, allowing a variety of styles and colors in furniture and decor to shine. From rustic to modern aesthetics, brown can complement both vibrant hues and softer pastels, facilitating a well-balanced design.
Additionally, brown walls can create a grounding effect, adding sophistication to a room without overwhelming it. Their timeless appeal ensures that they can seamlessly transition through trends, making them a reliable choice for any homeowner looking to create a stylish and enduring environment.
Before beginning to decorate, it is essential to gather all the necessary materials. These may include:
Paint or Wallpaper for the Walls in Various Shades of Brown:
Whether you are opting for a solid color or incorporating patterns, having different hues of brown can add depth and interest to the room.
The furniture chosen should complement the brown walls while also providing functionality and comfort. Consider using light-colored wood finishes to contrast with the dark walls, balancing out the space’s overall aesthetic.
Rugs, pillows, throws, curtains, and other decorative items can be used to add pops of color and texture to the room. Choose shades that complement the varying tones of brown on the walls.
7 Step-by-step Guidelines on How to Decorate a Room With Brown Walls
Step 1: Choose a Dominant Shade of Brown
The first step in decorating a room with brown walls is to select a dominant shade that will set the tone for the entire space. Consider the overall atmosphere you wish to create; for a more tranquil environment, opt for softer, lighter shades such as beige or taupe, which can open up the room and enhance natural light. Alternatively, deeper shades like chocolate or espresso can instill a sense of richness and coziness, perfect for creating a warm and inviting ambiance.
It’s essential to test paint samples or wallpaper swatches in different lighting conditions within the room, as the dominant shade can appear differently throughout the day. This careful selection will provide a solid foundation for the rest of your decor choices.
Step 2: Choose Complementary Colors
After establishing the dominant shade of brown, the next step is to select complementary colors that will enhance the beauty of the room. A good approach is to look for colors that provide contrast while maintaining harmony with the brown walls. Soft neutrals such as cream, beige, and light gray can create balance and prevent the space from feeling too dark.
For those seeking a bolder look, rich jewel tones like emerald green, deep burgundy, or navy blue can add drama and sophistication, making a striking statement against the brown backdrop. Incorporate these complementary colors through furniture, artwork, decorative accessories, or textiles to create a cohesive and visually appealing design. Remember to consider the overall mood you wish to convey; warmer tones can infuse energy and vibrancy, while cooler shades can evoke a sense of calm and serenity.
Step 3: Utilize Texture and Pattern
To prevent a room with brown walls from feeling flat or one-dimensional, incorporate various textures and patterns in your decor. This can be achieved through different fabrics, such as velvet, linen, or leather, which can add depth and interest to the space. Textured wallpaper or a statement rug can also provide a focal point and break up the monotony of solid-colored walls.
When incorporating patterns, choose ones that complement the dominant shade of brown while also adding diversity to the design. Stripes, geometric prints, floral motifs, or animal prints are all excellent choices for creating visual interest without overpowering the room.
Step 4: Introduce Natural Elements
Bringing nature indoors is an excellent way to add warmth and balance to a room with brown walls. Consider incorporating natural elements such as wood, stone, or plants into your design.
Wooden furniture pieces can provide a lovely contrast against the brown backdrop, while stone accents like marble or granite add a touch of luxury. Plants not only bring life and color to the space but also provide numerous health benefits such as purifying the air and reducing stress levels.
Step 5: Layer Lighting
Effective lighting is crucial in a room with brown walls, as it can significantly impact the overall ambiance and visual appeal. Begin by considering a mix of ambient, task, and accent lighting to create a well-balanced environment. Ambient lighting serves as the primary light source, so choose fixtures that provide a warm glow, such as ceiling lights or floor lamps with soft shades.
Next, incorporate task lighting in areas where specific activities will take place, like reading or cooking. Table lamps and under-cabinet lighting are great options to enhance functionality without overwhelming the space. Finally, use accent lighting to highlight architectural features, artwork, or decorative elements.
Wall sconces or spotlights can draw attention to these focal points, adding depth and character to the room. As you layer your lighting, be mindful of the color temperature; warmer hues can complement the rich tones of brown walls, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere.
Step 6: Add Personal Touches
A room’s decor is not complete without personal touches that reflect the homeowner’s unique style and personality. Consider incorporating family photos, artwork, or sentimental objects into your design to create a sense of warmth and character. These elements can add visual interest and serve as excellent conversation starters when entertaining guests.
You can also add personal touches through decorative accessories such as pillows, throws, and curtains. These items not only add color and texture to the room but also provide an opportunity to infuse your unique taste and style.
Step 7: Create Balance
Achieving balance in a room with brown walls is essential for creating a harmonious and inviting environment. Balance can be established through the careful distribution of furniture, decor, and colors throughout the space. Start by arranging your furniture in a way that promotes flow and functionality, ensuring that larger pieces are not clustered in one area, which can create an overwhelming feeling.
Incorporate similar visual weight across the room by pairing lighter or more colorful items with the darker brown elements. For instance, if you have a heavy brown leather sofa, consider balancing it with a lightweight chair or an accent table in a lighter material or hue.
Artwork or wall decor should also be placed thoughtfully, ensuring that pieces of varying sizes are consistently spaced and positioned to maintain visual equilibrium.
Additionally, mixing heights of decorative accessories on shelves or tables can contribute to a balanced aesthetic, drawing the eye around the room while keeping the space engaging and comfortable.
By following these steps on how to decorate a room with brown walls, you can create a beautiful and inviting room with brown walls that reflect your unique style and personality. Remember to have fun and experiment with different colors, textures, and patterns to find the perfect combination for your space. With careful consideration and attention to detail, a room with brown walls has the potential to become a warm, stylish, and cozy haven in your home. So go ahead and embrace this versatile shade; it may just surprise you! Happy decorating!
Additional Tips and Ideas
- Consider adding metallic accents, such as gold or copper, to add a touch of glamour and sophistication to the space.
- If you have brown walls in a small room, consider using lighter shades of furniture and decor to prevent the space from feeling cramped.
- Don’t be afraid to mix and match different shades of brown for a more dynamic design.
- Incorporate mirrors into your design to reflect light and create the illusion of a larger space.
- For a bold look, consider painting an accent wall in a contrasting color, such as navy blue or emerald green, to make the brown walls pop.
- Experiment with different lighting fixtures and bulbs to find the perfect balance between warm and cool tones.
- Plants should be used not only as decorative elements but also as natural air purifiers to improve indoor air quality.
- When choosing artwork or decorative accessories, opt for pieces that complement the overall color scheme and mood of the room.
- Consider using a rug to add texture and break up the monotony of brown walls.
- Don’t be afraid to mix different design styles, such as modern and bohemian, for a unique and eclectic look.
Decorating a room with brown walls may initially seem like a challenge, but with thoughtful planning and creativity, it can lead to a stunning and personalized space.
By carefully selecting complementary colors, incorporating natural elements, layering lighting effectively, and adding personal touches, you can transform your room into a warm and inviting sanctuary. Remember to strive for balance in your design, and don’t hesitate to experiment with textures and patterns to discover what resonates with your style.
Brown walls can serve as a versatile foundation, allowing you to create an environment that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also a true reflection of your personality. Embrace the journey of decorating, and enjoy the process of crafting a beautiful and cozy haven in your home!

TIMES LEADER LIVING
FREELAND When J. Neil Della Croce comes home from college for a weekend visit with his parents, it’s pretty common for the topic of conversation around the dinner table to focus on teeth.
No, his family members don’t chew with their mouths open. But Della Croce’s dad and sister are dentists, and he’s following in their footsteps. For them, talking about teeth is like discussing the weather, politics or sports.
“It’s almost as if it was our sport. It is our sport,” the 24-year-old said during a recent interview at his father and sister’s dental office in Freeland.
Della Croce is a first-year student in Temple University’s dentistry program, pursuing his doctorate.
Perhaps that’s not too surprising, considering that his sister, father, grandfather, grandfather’s uncle and great-grandfather all graduated from Temple’s dentistry program.
“I felt it was expected of me. But I was kind of on the fence because I wanted to do my own thing,” Della Croce admitted.
As it turns out, doing his own thing led him back down a path to dentistry, but not before opening up several new doors that broadened his career path.
After graduating from Bishop Hafey High School in Hazle Township in 2000, Della Croce enrolled at King’s College, where he pursued a double-major in neuroscience and biology and a minor in English literature.
After graduation, he spent the summer of 2004 shadowing doctors at medical and dental offices, and then did an internship with the Campbells soup company in New York City thanks to a family friend who is a recruiter with the company.
Next, he applied to Temple, but his application was rejected. So he enrolled at Bloomsburg University and earned a master’s degree in exercise physiology because he’s “always been interested in exercise.”
Della Croce was required to write a thesis paper as part of his master’s degree work, so he applied to a dental clinic near Philadelphia as a research assistant.
Little did he know at the time that Prosthodontics Intermedica in Fort Washington was the home base of Dr. Thomas Balshi, who developed “Teeth in a Day” after studying with Swedish scientist Per Ingvar Brånemark.
The trademarked process allows patients to receive a full set of permanent replacement teeth – similar to dentures, but with the plates permanently attached inside the mouth – in one visit.
Della Croce exudes enthusiasm when explaining the process, noting that Balshi developed it as a result of what Brånemark thought was a failed experiment – using a metal tube to rejoin a broken bone in a rabbit’s leg.
The metal tube bonded with the bone and could not be removed, but Balshi saw that the process would be beneficial with dental implants.
Della Croce learned all about the process, and so impressed were the young student’s new employers with his interest, multifaceted experience and drive to succeed, he was chosen to make presentations on the breakthrough dental technique at conferences.
He even appeared in a TV commercial with race car driver Mario Andretti to promote the dental implant method.
After working to improve his test-taking skills, Della Croce reapplied to Temple, and this time, his entrance exam scores surpassed even his sister’s and father’s. He continues working as a research assistant with Prosthodontics while attending Temple.
Through all his experiences, Della Croce said he’s learned one important thing that other students should keep in mind.
“Apparent times of failure ended up to be the most important component to one’s success. Per Ingvar Brånemark’s apparent failure when his metal tube could not be removed, and my failure to be accepted to Temple Dental on my first application made all the difference in our stories,” Della Croce said.
“Without these moments of failure, our futures would never have been the same. I definitely would not have gone to Bloomsburg and delved into research as soon as I did, and I surely would have missed the opportunity to work with Dr. Balshi,” he said.
But does he have any second thoughts about “doing his own thing” instead of dentistry?
“I’m glad I explored other options. Now I’m comfortable that this is what I want to do. … I guess this is what I was made to do,” Della Croce said, sporting nothing less than a perfect smile.
“Apparent times of failure ended up to be the most important component to one’s success.”

"This patient was told by another dentist that she was not a candidate for permanent teeth with dental implants because she sustained advanced bone loss from decades of wearing removable dentures. After many consultations she considered having extensive bone grafting from her hips. This procedure was risky, painful and had a high chance of failure. The process would have taken 19 to 24 months to complete.
Prior to making a final decision about hip grafting, the patient was referred to the Pi Dental Center for one last opinion. CT Scans confirmed extensive bone loss, but permitted virtual implant planning for the placement of zygomatic and pterygomaxillary implants using the No Bone Solution protocol in conjunction with the Teeth In A Day® treatment method. This treatment required a minimal number of visits.
Surgery was performed during the first visit following the initial consultation. Implants were placed and a set of non-removable teeth were provided.
Ten weeks later impressions were made for the final prosthesis. The last visit consisted of changing the provisional prostheses for the final CM Prostheses in the upper and lower jaws. Now she is all smiles!",0.9705030918121338,228,1.4286259412765503

Billy McCaslin got 60 days in jail and two years probation, while Sergio Irreza got 30 days in jail and two years probation. Both pleaded guilty to one count of second degree burglary in April.
McCaslin and Irreza were caught on a surveillance system inside Ware's Cherry Creek home during a Monday Night Football game in October.
They stole roughly $40,000 of valuables, including Ware’s Super Bowl 50 championship ring. The ring was later recovered.

Caring For And Wearing Your Jewelry
Here are some cleaning instructions for Sterling Silver jewelry:
- Combine a small amount of mild soap with lukewarm water.
- Use a small, soft toothbrush to gently scrub.
- Rinse with clean water.
- If dirt is hard to remove, soak jewelry in clean water for a few minutes; repeat steps 1-3.
- Pat dry with another dry soft cloth.
- Use a silver polish cloth to give your jewelry a final shine – also good for in-between cleanings.
- Be sure to let completely dry before storing in jewelry bags or boxes.
Other metals: Some metals tend to turn if it comes in contact with water and unfortunately can't be cleaned :-(
But here are some tips we hope it helps:
- To help protect the durability and quality of your jewelry, remove your jewelry when you shower, bathe or engage in heavy exercise, particularly when swimming in the sea or a chlorinated swimming pool.
- Avoid spraying aftershave, applying creams or any other liquids directly onto your jewelry.
- Keep your jewelry away from extreme temperatures, humidity or sunlight.
- Avoid exposure to harsh chemicals or environments that could compromise the integrity of your jewelry. Examples include, but are not limited to: Perspiration, perfumes, cleaning agents, chlorine, saltwater and silver polish.
- Do not store your jewelry in the bathroom where it could be exposed to wet conditions as humidity and moisture can make tarnish appear faster.
- Ideally store your pieces of jewelry separately, so that they don’t rub together or become tangled.
- To keep your jewelry looking radiant & to remove the build up of dirt & tarnish we recommend using a polishing cloth. Rub the piece in one direction rather than circular motions.
- Do not use tissue paper or paper towels to clean metals as they can cause scratching.",0.9322184920310974,1482,0.39452916383743286
"Véronique Vienne|Case Studies
December 31, 2009
The collection of the Picasso Museum in Paris is comprised of a gift that the Picasso family made to the country to avoid paying inheritance tax in France. However, the museum isn’t entrusted to adminster the reproduction rights of the works on its walls. Even the name of the Spanish master is the property of his heirs, which resulted in Byzantine negotiations when it came to designing a new logo for the famed Paris tourist destination. A fractured version of the word “Picasso,” it was recently introduced to coincide with the reopening of the museum after a controversial, $65-million, five-year renovation and expansion.
The Paris design studio c-album is responsible for the museum’s new identity. They came up with a clever launch campaign featuring one of the few aspects of the collection that remained royalty-free and accessible: the titles of the artworks. Museum employees volunteered to be photographed and filmed sporting T-shirts printed with the titles of some of the most iconic paintings under the museum’s stewardship. Clerks, janitors, guards, and curators stand poker-faced, like sentry, until they turn around, revealing what looks like a stolen postcard hidden behind their back.
The former museum director, Anne Baldassari agreed to participate in the quirky campaign, even though she had recently been fired by the French Ministry of Culture over her unorthodox management style. In the museum’s promotional video, she is seen upside down while her T-shirt reads right side up. The postcard she hides behind her back depicts the jester—Le Fou, a 1905 bronze by Picasso—a man who made a profession out of being a wild card.
Here is a short animation of Picasso Museum staff—and the shirts—in action.

"Whenever we talk about the most successful actors of India, then the names of Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Dilip Kumar or Kamal Haasan come to our minds. But do you know there was a bigger superstar than these actors who made such records that are impossible to touch even today? Today we are going to tell you about that Indian superstar, who has given not one or two but 700 hit films.?
Who was India's first superstar?
We are talking about Prem Nazir, the superstar of Malayalam films of the 50s. Yes, the veteran star of Malayalam cinema is also called the actor who brought the golden era of Malayalam cinema. Prem's acting was so powerful that every director of that era wanted to cast him in his film. Talking about Prem Nazir's record, he made many big records like doing the most films, most double roles, most triple roles and about 130 films with the same heroine. Due to this, not two or three but 39 of his films were released in the year 1979.
How is Nazir different from other superstars?
To understand how great Prem Nazir's record is, we tell you through a comparison. The biggest name in Indian cinema, Amitabh Bachchan, has less than 60 hit films as a lead actor, out of which 10 are blockbusters. Now comes the talk of South superstar Rajinikanth, who has a record of more than 80 hits and more than a dozen blockbusters. Let us now talk about the three Khans as well. Salman Khan has given 39 hit films out of which 15 are blockbusters, followed by Shah Rukh Khan who has given 34 hit films including 10 blockbusters. Aamir Khan is far behind with 20 hit films including 6 blockbusters.
You will be surprised to know that even after adding the hit films of all these actors, they do not even come close to the number of hits of Prem Nazir along with 50 of these being blockbusters. He played the lead role in more than 700 films due to which his name is recorded in the Limca World Record.?
Other records in the name of Prem Nazir
Prem Nazir has many other records to his name. He worked with 85 heroines. Till the year 1975, Prem worked with actress Sheela in a total of 130 films. This is because he considered Sheela as his lucky charm. He played double roles in more than 40 films. Apart from this, he also appeared in triple roles in three films.
Nazir is also remembered for his compassion
Prem Nazir's presence is a big reason why the Malayalam film industry was called the Golden Age. Prem was such an actor that if any of his films flopped, he would immediately ask the producer to start another film. The actor would take out dates from his busy schedule and do the producer's films so that his losses could be compensated.",0.9880483746528625,599,1.5492726564407349
"Intersections are common roadway features, whether four-way stops in a neighborhood or traffic-light-filled exchanges on busy multi-lane thoroughfares.
Given the frequency, variety and risk associated with intersections — more than 50 percent of serious accidents in the U.S. happen at or near them — it’s critical that an autonomous vehicle be able to accurately navigate them.
Handling intersections autonomously presents a complex set of challenges for self-driving cars. This includes the ability to stop accurately at an intersection wait line or crosswalk, correctly process and interpret right of way traffic rules in various scenarios, and determine and execute the correct path for a variety of maneuvers, such as proceeding straight through the intersection and unprotected intersection turns.
Earlier in the DRIVE Labs series, we demonstrated how we detect intersections, traffic lights, and traffic signs with the WaitNet DNN. And how we classify traffic light state and traffic sign type with the LightNet and SignNet DNNs. In this episode, we go further to show how NVIDIA uses AI to perceive the variety of intersection structures that an autonomous vehicle could encounter on a daily drive.

"Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs Confronts Over 120 Sexual Misconduct Accusations in New Lawsuits
The world-renowned hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, who recently faced arrest after a federal grand jury indictment, now stands amidst a storm of new sexual misconduct allegations. On Tuesday, Tony Buzbee, a Texas-based attorney, revealed at a press conference that he is representing 120 accusers who claim misconduct against Combs over the last two decades.
Buzbee vowed to expose those who allowed this alleged behavior to continue in the entertainment industry. “We will expose the enablers who facilitated this conduct behind closed doors. We will pursue this matter no matter who the evidence implicates,” Buzbee declared in the press conference, hinting at a network of complicit individuals and organizations.
Allegations Span Ages, Locations, and Genders
According to Andrew Van Arsdale, one of the plaintiff attorneys, the scale and scope of the forthcoming legal actions are “unprecedented.” The lawsuits involve both male and female accusers, ranging in age from as young as nine to 38 at the time of the alleged incidents. The accusations span various states and cities, including New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, and cover a timeline of over 20 years.
Van Arsdale shared that each of the 120 plaintiffs will file separate lawsuits, reflecting the wide-ranging and diverse nature of the claims. In preparation for the legal battles ahead, Buzbee emphasized that his team has amassed substantial evidence, including photographs, videos, and text messages, all pointing to serious misconduct by Combs.
“We have many powerful people and many dirty secrets involved in these cases,” Buzbee added, hinting at an extensive web of activities that extend beyond Combs himself. He further mentioned that over 3,000 individuals have come forward with accusations against Combs, indicating a potential tidal wave of claims that could continue to emerge.
Details of the New Civil Claims Against Combs
Buzbee outlined the gravity of the allegations in the new civil claims, which include “violent sexual assault or rape, facilitated sex with controlled substances, dissemination of video recordings, and sexual abuse of minors.” Some of the names involved are said to be shocking, suggesting the reach of these claims could deeply impact the music and entertainment industry.
He provided a demographic breakdown of the new claimants: 62% are African American, originating from more than 25 states. Additionally, 25 of the accusers were minors at the time of the incidents, with the earliest reported case dating back to 1991, involving a victim who was only nine years old.
Separately, it was reported by the New York Post that a sexually explicit video allegedly featuring Combs and another A-list celebrity is being “shopped around,” adding to the escalating controversy.
Criminal Charges: Combs Detained Without Bail
Currently detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, Combs has been denied bail after being charged with a range of criminal offenses, including sex trafficking, racketeering, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges brought against him.
Marc Agnifilo, Combs’s lawyer, provided a defense for the investigation’s discovery of 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant found during raids on Combs’s residences. “He has a big house; he buys in bulk,” Agnifilo stated, downplaying the discovery and implying that the purchase was for practical reasons rather than incriminating ones.
Agnifilo also sought to explain the nature of parties referred to in government filings as “elaborate sex performances,” which allegedly involved force, coercion, and prolonged sexual acts involving male commercial sex workers. He dismissed the characterization of these events, saying, “They called them ‘freak-offs.’ But, you know, back when I was a kid in the late ’70s, they were called threesomes.”
Combs Denies All Claims and Seeks to Prove Innocence
In response to the surge of allegations, Combs has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, calling the claims “sickening allegations” driven by individuals seeking “a quick payday.” These criminal charges stem from accusations made in previous civil suits, including a high-profile case brought forward by Cassandra “Cassie” Ventura, Combs’s ex-girlfriend, who filed a civil suit accusing him of assault and sex trafficking.
The growing list of accusers recently expanded to include Dawn Richard, a former member of the girl group Danity Kane, who alleged that Combs groped, assaulted, imprisoned, and threatened her life during their professional interactions.
Combs’s attorney, Erica Wolff, has criticized the media’s coverage of these allegations, labeling it a “reckless media circus” and asserting that Combs “emphatically and categorically denies as false and defamatory any claim that he sexually abused anyone, including minors.” Wolff also expressed confidence in her client’s ability to prove his innocence in court if and when the claims are formally filed and served.
A Look at the Accusations and the Music Mogul’s Defense
The allegations against Sean “Diddy” Combs have rapidly multiplied in scope and severity. With over 120 individual lawsuits expected to be filed in the coming weeks, this case is already being regarded as one of the largest sexual misconduct controversies within the entertainment industry in recent history. While Combs continues to deny the accusations, maintaining that these are baseless attacks on his character, the unfolding lawsuits and the evidence gathered are sure to bring further developments to this high-profile case.
As the world waits to see how these lawsuits unfold, the battle lines are clearly drawn, with the accusers aiming to bring justice to light and Combs’s legal team preparing for an intense fight to clear his name.",0.9603927731513977,1257,0.7810371518135071

"It isn’t just the style that becomes outdated in a kitchen; the layout, functionality, and energy and water usage are also important parts of a kitchen update. At Dimension Design-Build-Remodel, Inc., we’re always observing changes in the kitchen design industry. Features that increase convenience, efficiency, and style are all on our list of kitchen trends for 2023.
“There are so many options, so much variety in kitchen remodels. The possibilities for your dream kitchen are endless,” said David Kallie, CR, CAPS, Dimension’s president and CEO. “We take your budget into account, and as a design-build team, we work toward making that dream possible.”
Homeowners have a variety of countertop material and color options, but quartz continues to grow in popularity above all others. Dimension Design-Build-Remodel has recommended quartz for years because it is easier to customize and trim, easier to maintain, and longer lasting.
Your kitchen remodel will be a good time to update the metals you choose for drawer pulls, lighting fixtures, the range hood, and more. Instead of traditional chrome, homeowners have growing interest in copper, brushed gold, and matte aluminum.
Muted Colors & Dark Wood
Colors are a personal choice, affected by the style of the home and the owner’s tastes. However, whites, grays, and beiges have been a noticeably popular trend in the past couple years. This is beginning to change. “We’re seeing a shift away from white to muted, natural colors like sage green, stone blue, and dusty rose,” Kallie said. As for kitchen flooring and cabinetry, look for an increase in natural wood in darker stains to trend in the coming year. “Will white cabinetry ever stop trending?” Kallie asks. “Only time will tell.”
Traditional backsplash choices like white subway tile and glass mosaic are becoming less popular, while unique tiles and textures are gaining momentum. “One of the more minimalist approaches appearing in new houses is the seamless look, where the countertop and backsplash are the same material and style,” Kallie said.
Premium Energy Efficiency
Conserving energy will continue to trend indefinitely, both for saving the planet and saving money. “After HVAC, the water heater uses the most energy in the house,” Kallie said. “Induction is the most energy-efficient way to cook.” Manufacturers are developing more induction cooking options each year, as well as more efficient refrigerators, which are the top energy users in kitchens.
Waste Less, Touch Less
The trends for touchless and water-saving faucets and appliances will only continue to grow in popularity. Touchless technology became more necessary than ever during the pandemic, and the trend is not slowing down. Dishwasher and faucet efficiency and performance improve each year, making their replacement a smart kitchen trend during major renovations.
Concealed Kitchen Design
The main purpose of concealed kitchen design is to reduce visual clutter by blending and hiding as much as possible. Customizable appliances that perfectly mimic the cabinetry are a trend that has been gaining speed for years. New in concealed kitchen design is the secret butler’s pantry for food prep near the dining area, hidden behind a matching cabinetry panel or a “sliding wall” door.
As the trend of open kitchens thrives, the historical scullery kitchen is quietly returning to homes. Similar to the butler’s pantry, the scullery is a room separate from the main kitchen, specifically for cleaning and storing dishes. Having a separate place to store the mess—and find peace and quiet during the cleaning—make this a popular upcoming kitchen design trend for those who entertain.
Kitchen trends will continue to evolve into 2023 and beyond, but a healthy home never goes out of style. Learn more about the best upgrade for an outdated home: a healthier living environment from Dimension Design-Build-Remodel.

"96-Well Plasmid DNA Preparation
Our Laboratory Automation group has developed a purification system to isolate high-quality plasmid DNA in 96-well format. The purified plasmid DNA is suitable for a broad range of downstream applications, including transfection, in vitro expression, automated fluorescent DNA sequencing and cloning.
We currently offer our plate-based DNA preparation service either as a stand-alone service or in combination with our DNA sequencing options.
- User will submit 96-well deep well culture block with cell pellets.
- Bacterial cells undergo alkaline lyis, and the released DNA is bound to an in-house developed spin filter. The plasmid DNA is eluted in 50 ul 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. A small aliquot of purified plasmid DNA is used for quantitation with a SpectraMax Plus 384 plate reader, and another aliquot will be removed for sequencing (if ordered). The remaining volume is approximately 30 ul (per well).
- Using the Janus Mini MDT Automated Workstation in combination with a low-speed benchtop centrifuge, we can process up to four 96-well plates simultaneously.
- DNA yield might vary depending on plasmid copy number, E. coli strain, and growth conditions (growth medium, incubation time, aeration).
Turnaround time depends on the total number of plates received but is typically 1-2 business days.
The same turnaround time applies for a combined 96-Well Plasmid Preparation PLUS Sequencing request. Sequencing data are usually available within 24 hours upon completion of the plasmid preparation order.
- Upon completion of an order, clients will receive an automated email stating that their order is ready to be delivered to the desired remote drop box or can be picked up at the core facility; the quantitation data (OD260, OD280, 260/280, DNA concentration) will be included as an attachment.
Plasmid DNA preparations are returned in a sealed V-bottom polystyrene plate and will be delivered to the appropriate remote drop-box location via our free Courier service (currently for internal customers only). If preferred, orders can also be picked up directly at our facility.
Please note: We recommend that you retrieve your plasmid DNA preparations as soon as possible. We will discard preps after approximately four weeks if they have not been picked up.

"Imagine a world where packages magically appear at your doorstep within minutes of placing an order, thanks to the innovative use of drones. The question on everyone’s minds is: can this futuristic dream actually become a reality? In this article, we will explore the feasibility of drone delivery services, the challenges they face, and the potential benefits they could bring to our everyday lives. From saving time and reducing carbon emissions to overcoming logistical hurdles, the possibilities are endless. So, fasten your seatbelts and get ready to take a journey into the exciting realm of drones and their potential to revolutionize the way we receive packages.
Can Drones Deliver Packages?
1. Introduction to drone delivery
Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have gained significant attention in recent years for their potential to revolutionize the way packages are delivered. These small, remotely piloted aircraft have the ability to transport goods from one location to another, bypassing traditional delivery methods. Drone delivery has the potential to offer fast, efficient, and cost-effective solutions for delivering packages to both urban and rural areas.
2. Advantages of drone delivery
There are several advantages to using drones for package delivery. Firstly, drones can significantly reduce delivery times. With conventional methods, packages often face delays due to traffic congestion or other logistical challenges. Drones, on the other hand, can navigate through the air using the most direct route, ensuring speedy delivery.
Secondly, drone delivery can be highly cost-effective. Traditional delivery methods involve multiple personnel, vehicles, and fuel costs. Drones eliminate the need for these resources, resulting in reduced operational expenses.
Additionally, drones have the potential to reach remote areas that are otherwise difficult to access by conventional means. This could be particularly beneficial in emergency situations or when delivering to rural or hard-to-reach locations where road infrastructure may be limited.
3. Challenges of drone delivery
While the concept of drone delivery holds great promise, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. One key challenge is ensuring the safety of both the drones and the people on the ground. Drones flying in the same airspace as other aircraft, such as helicopters or planes, introduce risks of collisions or interference with their operations. Robust safety measures and regulations must be in place to mitigate these risks.
Another challenge is the limited payload capacity of drones. Most commercial drones currently available have weight limitations, which means they can only carry small packages. This restricts the range of items that can be delivered via drones and may not be suitable for larger or heavier objects.
Battery life is another constraint for drone delivery. To cover longer distances or deliver multiple packages in a single trip, drones require longer flight times. However, extending battery life while maintaining safety and operational efficiency is a complex task that requires ongoing technological advancements.
4. Current drone delivery initiatives
Several companies and organizations have already launched drone delivery initiatives. Amazon, for example, introduced its Prime Air service, aiming to deliver packages within 30 minutes. Other companies such as UPS, DHL, and Walmart are also exploring the potential use of drones for package delivery.
In addition to commercial initiatives, drones have been utilized for humanitarian purposes. Organizations like Zipline have employed drones to deliver medical supplies and blood to remote areas in Rwanda and Ghana, where road infrastructure is limited.
5. Regulations and restrictions
To ensure safe and responsible drone operations, governments around the world have implemented regulations and restrictions on drone usage. These regulations often involve height restrictions, flight restrictions near airports, and licensing requirements for drone pilots. While these regulations are necessary to protect public safety, they can also pose challenges for the widespread adoption of drone delivery. Striking the right balance between enabling innovation and ensuring public safety remains a key consideration.
6. Drone delivery in urban areas
Urban areas present their own unique set of challenges for drone delivery. One of the primary concerns is airspace congestion. In densely populated cities, airspace is often shared by various aircraft, including helicopters, small planes, and recreational drones. Implementing clear and efficient air traffic management systems will be crucial to avoid collisions and ensure safe drone operations.
Delivery logistics in urban areas also need to be carefully managed. Factors such as accurate address identification, landing site availability, and avoiding potential obstacles like buildings or power lines must be taken into account. Integrating drone delivery into existing urban infrastructure will require collaboration between drone companies, local authorities, and city planners.
7. Drone delivery in rural areas
While drone delivery in urban areas poses its own challenges, rural areas offer a different set of opportunities and considerations. In regions with limited access to road networks or during emergencies, drones can play a crucial role in delivering essential supplies. They can bypass impassable terrain or congested roads, providing a lifeline to remote communities.
In rural areas, the feasibility of drone delivery is often enhanced by larger landing areas, fewer airspace restrictions, and potentially lighter air traffic compared to urban areas. However, addressing logistics challenges such as long distances and identifying suitable landing zones will require extensive planning and coordination.
8. Security and privacy concerns
The increased use of drones for package delivery raises legitimate security and privacy concerns. Drones equipped with cameras and sensors raise questions about potential surveillance and breaches of privacy. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring secure operations will be paramount to gaining public trust and embracing drone delivery on a larger scale.
Measures such as secure communication channels, encryption protocols, and adherence to privacy laws and regulations can help address these concerns. Transparent and accountable practices by drone operators will also be crucial in building public acceptance and minimizing any potential misuse or invasion of privacy.
9. Environmental impact
The environmental impact of drone delivery is an important consideration when evaluating its feasibility. Compared to traditional delivery methods involving multiple vehicles, drones have the potential to reduce carbon emissions and minimize the ecological footprint associated with package transportation.
However, the manufacturing, maintenance, and disposal of drones also have environmental implications. The life cycle assessment of drones, including their energy consumption and the materials used, needs to be taken into account. Striving for sustainable practices in drone production and operation will be key to maximizing the environmental benefits of drone delivery.
10. Future of drone delivery
The future of drone delivery holds great promise, with ongoing advancements in technology, regulations, and operational capabilities. As drone technology continues to evolve, it is likely that drones will be able to carry larger payloads, travel longer distances, and operate more efficiently. The development of autonomous drones that can navigate complex environments without human intervention is also being explored.
To fully realize the potential of drone delivery, it will be essential for industry stakeholders, policymakers, and the public to work together. Collaborative efforts can address challenges, refine regulations, and build public trust in this emerging mode of package transportation. With careful planning, innovation, and responsible practices, drone delivery has the potential to revolutionize the way packages are delivered and make a positive impact on various sectors, including e-commerce, healthcare, and logistics.",0.9359755516052246,1421,2.8379974365234375

Effect of traveling waves on VIV of long flexible cylinders
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Mechanical Engineering.

Show full item recordAbstract
Offshore marine risers and pipelines, exposed to ocean currents, are susceptible to Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV). Accurate prediction of VIV is necessary for estimating the fatigue life as well as for taking corrective measures to prevent the vibrations. State of the art response prediction methods work reasonably well for short flexible cylinders vibrating at frequencies corresponding to low mode numbers (below the tenth mode). However, for long structures, which respond above the tenth mode, lack of experimental data has until recently impeded progress. Results will be presented from recent field experiments conducted in the Gulf Stream and Lake Seneca, NY. These experiments have provided an opportunity for new insights about the VIV of long flexible cylinders, responding at high mode numbers. The experimental results also include insights on the use of VIV suppression devices such as helical strakes. The experiments reveal that the dominant response of long flexible cylinders is often in the form of traveling waves. High spatial density fiber optic strain gauge measurements are used to obtain estimates of the phase speed of the waves, the response amplitude and the added mass coefficient. The mean added mass coefficient for the bare cylinder is shown to be approximately one and the maximum response amplitude is found to be approximately one diameter. A Green's function, response prediction method, is introduced which is able to emulate both the standing and traveling wave properties observed in the experimental data. (cont.) A novel approach to modeling the excitation force as a combination of standing and traveling wave components is shown to predict the measured response very well. The method is also able to account for high localized damping that result from the use of response suppression devices, such as helical strakes. Many marine risers are composed of nested concentric steel pipes. The relative motion of these concentric pipes in the presence of confined liquids introduces unusual dynamic properties, including the potential for beneficial effects as dynamic absorbers. Numerical and theoretical models are developed as a preliminary step in the design of dynamic absorbers for deep water risers.

"On November 13, ET reported that Sebi had proposed raising the maximum investment limit by an angel fund in a startup to Rs 25 crore. Angel funds, a type of Category I Alternative Investment Fund’s - Venture Capital Funds, provide capital to start-ups from angel investors.
Now, along with the said proposal, investors may soon be allowed to include Hindu undivided families (HUFs), family trusts, and sole proprietorships which will expand the scope for angel funds, Business Standard reported.
Sebi had proposed that the minimum investment limit should be reduced to Rs 10 lakh from the present Rs 25 lakh, and that the maximum investment limit be increased to Rs 25 crore from the current Rs 10 crore. It had also put forward that only ""accredited investors"" may invest in angel funds. This would simplify their fundraising processes, encourage transparency and provide operational clarity and investment flexibility.
The regulator might also remove the minimum corpus requirement of Rs 5 crore, if five accredited investors are onboarded before angel funds start investing. For such funds, the 25% diversification limit will be removed.
All such moves will be a huge relief for upcoming startups and will ensure that these funds will be limited to investors with the right risk appetite and possess the ability to evaluate investment proposals.",0.9539792537689209,262,1.7331268787384033

I promised media I would post a flow diagram so here is it, ugly (and provisional) as it may be.
The blue green arrows running clockwise show the direction of influence for the Persona parsimoniae counter-narrative(Pp). From the top, it begins at leisure/disposable time, an increase in which results in an increase in Income/consumption, Production and, finally, Accumulation/investment. Because there is an inherent limit to accumulation, the excess not absorbed into further increases in leisure becomes superfluous consumption and overproduction. There could also be an arrow added from the superfluous box to indicate that today's excess could become tomorrow's standard.*
Conversely, the purple arrows running counter-clockwise indicate the flow for the traditional Economic Man model(EM). These start (hypothetically) at Investment/accumulation (the order of priority reversed) and proceed through Production, Consumption/income and back to Accumulation. In this direction of flow, leisure or disposable time is conceived of as a subtraction from the flow.
*As media suggested, such a chart may be thought of as representing a two-way flow, with elements of either Pp or EM coming into play depending on the circumstances. That two-way flow could obviate the need for an arrow leading back into consumption (or production) from the superfluous consumption node.",0.9393829107284546,294,1.8344448804855347
"What You Need to Know About VOC and Should You Be Concerned
Do you want to embark on your first wood stain project? Or you are a frequent DIY stainer? Well, you must learn about the type of products that you want to bring home.
As with paints, paint finish, thinner or solvent, the formulas contain ingredients that pose health and safety concerns. To be specific, let’s talk about volatile organic compounds commonly known as VOCs, a component used in wood stain colors from different brands.
According to research by CBC marketplace, high VOC levels of above 500 ppb cause severe problems to people with various chemical sensitivities. Before starting your next stain project, take your time to understand VOCs, their risks and how to best avoid them.
But first, what are VOCs, and how do they relate with wood stain colors?
A compound is a combination of various elements from the periodic table. The presence of carbon in VOCs makes them organic and the ability of these compounds to evaporate at room temperature makes them volatile.
Unfortunately, VOCs are toxic to people and animals. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, these compounds contain chemicals with adverse health effects. Because of this, there are strict rules that should be followed on warning labels, product packaging, and their correct use. Manufacturers of stain wood colors must also follow strict regulations when creating consumer products.
How Are VOCs Dangerous?
As stated earlier, VOCs are highly volatile and will evaporate at room temperature. As such, VOCs will be emitted to the atmosphere every time you open the can, applying the paint with a brush or when the stains are drying.
These fumes are harmful to respiratory systems. Once in the air, they can mix with nitrogen oxide to form what’s known as bad ozone. Bad ozone is attributable to various health and environmental problems.
Given all these health effects from VOCs, how do you protect yourself? Well, you can use a mask to apply wood stain in ventilated areas or look for a VOC free stain.
Why Use VOCs
You're probably thinking, why use wood stain colors with VOCs if they are harmful? Well, these compounds give stains and paints the ability to perform their role. Adding VOCs holds together resin and water allowing them to form a cohesive paste that sticks on the wood surface. Therefore, avoiding these compounds is near impossible. However, some manufacturers are coming together to create low VOC paint.
Are There Less Toxic Wood Stain Colors
The good news is, there is low VOC paint that delivers vivid results while minimizing the toxicity. So, take your time when looking for wood stain colors and paints to buy. Ensure the product aims at protecting the user and the environment while providing amazing results.
Other than protecting your family’s health, these low VOC stains are also easier to clean. You’ll only need to buy soap and water. While you still need to do the staining in an open or ventilated room, you don’t have to worry about wearing masks.
To ensure that you're using paints with lower toxicity, read the labels and follow the instructions on how to use the product. If any stain remains, dispose of it responsibly.
Wood stain can take a dull piece of wood, give it depth and enhance the tone, color, and appearance. Woodworkers have been using this method for years to improve the state of their furniture. The ingredients for traditional stains are toxic with the possibility of releasing toxic chemicals. Such chemicals pose a huge risk to your health and that of your family. Therefore, you need to take your time and look for a non-toxic wood stain on the market.",0.9550531506538391,772,3.012410879135132

Humanizing your website to demonstrate experience to users and search engines is vital. One effective way to do this is by sharing the faces behind your website and showcasing the expertise and experience within your organization. Additionally, a well-thought-out “About Us” page can provide valuable insights into your team’s experience and knowledge. By highlighting the expertise in your organization and presenting authentic stories of real-life experience, you can establish trust and credibility with your audience.
Emphasize the Human Element
With the rise of AI content generation, it has become increasingly crucial to prioritize experience and showcase the human element on your website. While AI can assist in content creation, it cannot replicate the depth of knowledge, insight, and personal touch from lived experience. By leveraging your unique experiences and demonstrating them through your content and website, you can differentiate yourself from AI-generated content and build a strong foundation of trust with your audience.

In conclusion, experience is vital in demonstrating expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness. As AI content generation becomes more prevalent, it is crucial to humanize your website by showcasing the lived experiences within your organization. By leveraging your unique insights and offering a personal touch, you can differentiate yourself from AI-generated content and build trust with your audience.

""Ukraine has a critical need to defend itself against missile attacks, and Norway will assist, says Norway’s minister of defense,"" the words of Norway’s Minister of Defense heads the statement of the Norwegian government on the decision.
According to the statement, in cooperation with the United States, Norway will provide Ukraine with two NASAMS firing units. They will come in addition to the two firing units provided by the United States in the fall of last year.
""NASAMS have proved to be an effective air defense system. Adding two more firing units will significantly improve Ukraine’s ability to protect its cities and critical infrastructure from Russian missile attacks.Norway will also train Ukrainian personnel in the maintenance and operation of the system,"" the statement reads.
""Norway has previously contributed equipment and training to US donations of NASAMS to Ukraine. These donations have been highly valued and contributed to defeat missile attacks. Continuing Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure highlight the need to further improve Ukraine’s air defence. Ukraine has repeatedly requested international partners to provide more and better air defence systems,"" Norway’s Minister of Defense Bjørn Arild Gram said commenting the decision to provide Ukraine with more NASAMS firing units.
As the statement published on the website of the Norwegian government states, the Norwegian parliament, Stortinget, recently agreed on a multi-year program named after Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian diplomat, scientist and polar explorer. Under the Nansen Programme, Norway will grant NOK 15 bn (USD 1,6 bn) each year in the period 2023-2027. For 2023, half of the grant will go towards military assistance.
It should be noted, that NASAMS (Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, also known as the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) is a short- to medium-range ground-based air defense system developed by Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace (KDA) and Raytheon. The system defends against unmanned aerial vehicles, helicopters, cruise missiles, unmanned combat aerial vehicles, and fixed wing aircraft.
A standard NASAMS unit has a modular design comprising a command post the FDC, an active 3D radar Raytheon AN/MPQ-64F1 Sentinel, a passive electro-optical and infrared sensor and a number of missile canister launchers with AMRAAM missiles. Normally, a number of NASAMS fire units are netted together in a uniquely designed ”hard-realtime” communication network to ensure minimum latency over large distances for maximum system performance utilizing the unique capabilities of the AMRAAM missile.

"Disclaimer: Any opinions expressed in the following article belong solely to the author and do not reflect or represent Newsner.
Voluntatem populi. The will of the people.
It’s democracy boiled down to its finest fibre, the greatest ideal that any self-respecting civilization should aspire to be governed by. Even when that will leaves a fraction under half of an entire population looking down the barrel of a bleak horizon, mouths agape in disbelief.
Earlier this week Donald Trump concluded what is not only the greatest political resurrection in US history, but arguably in the history of human politics. Flying in the face of decency and rewriting the playbook with regards to the qualities any aspiring leader of a country must have, the oft-extreme, ever cult-like values and components of Trumpism won the day.
So, as much of the rest of the world look to the US and wonder who poured what in the Kool-Aid, there is one undeniable fact they must choke down: there will be four more years of Trump, and all the uncertainty and unpredictability that he promises. His methods, antics, tendencies and flagrant lies don’t just upset the apple cart; they roll the damn thing off of a cliff onto a pre-school packed with children.
But hey-ho, the people have spoken: this is what America – or at the very least the majority who went to vote – wants. The coming four years should look extremely different to the previous four (or else what’s the point?), and each and every person who voted for Trump will have to live with their decision, for better or worse.
Of course, there will be those who are sure to benefit from Trump’s return to the Oval Office. I’m not talking about the people who make up the backbone of the country. No, regardless of what sweet nothings you’ve been spoon-fed about tax-breaks and better jobs and less migrants to eat your cats and dogs, it’s unlikely much will change in your day-to-day. I’m speaking of the individuals at the top of the ladder who vehemently championed Trump’s cause and have three salient points in common: they’re super rich, they’re white, and they’re male.
People like Elon Musk, whose stake in all of this – in my opinion – extends only as far as protecting the interests of his companies (regardless of the yarn he admirably tries to spin with a view of becoming some sort of right-wing folk hero). People like Dana White, caught on video hitting his wife last year, well known for throwing his toys out of the pram whenever someone is perceived to have benefitted from following a course of action he himself did not intend. People like *cough* news anchor? *cough* Tucker Carlson, who recently blamed an increase in hurricanes on abortions like some mead-mad 13th century town lunatic.
Suffice to say, Trump’s gaggle of sycophants and ‘yes’ men is sure to turn the White House into a nest of vipers, all of them vying for a pat on the head from the big man.
And yet there’s one person entangled close to the ugly nucleus of the sticky spider-web of Trump’s boundless ambition that I actually find myself feeling sorry for: Melania.
Only a fool would believe that Donald and Melania Trump have had anything close to the sort of stable, loving union showcased by, say, Barrack and Michelle Obama. At least not in recent years. Their marriage is functioning, sure, but in my opinion that’s almost entirely due to the fact that in reality it requires very little on the part of either party. They each play their role without having to do anything beyond occasionally standing beside one another while other people take pictures.
Even so, something has definitely changed in Melania since she and her dearly beloved were booted from the White House in 2020. Perhaps it was the chaos let loose by her husband’s deranged ravings in light of losing the election? Or the egregious attack on democracy that culminated in the ugliness that unfolded on Capitol Hill? Or perhaps it was the hush-money scandal relating to Melania’s righteous, god-abiding husband’s affair with ex-porn star Stormy Daniels?
Late Tuesday night, Donald appeared on center stage at West Palm Beach’s Palm Beach County Convention Center to claim his victory and celebrate with his supporters. By his side was Melania, and the two shared a relatively rare moment of public affectionate. The former The Apprentice star turned to Melania, smiled, and said, “Come here, honey.”
Even then, the tension between them was obvious. And no, I don’t mean that in a good way.
The two shared a hug and exchanged a kiss, and though many dubbed it a beautiful moment, multiple one body language experts were left unconvinced. One of those, Darren Stanton, stated that Melania was reluctant to even walk to her husband on stage, claiming that there was “no closeness.”
“When Trump looks back at Melania and gestures to her to come over for a hug, she reluctantly comes forward,” Stanton said on behalf of Spin Genie.
“It’s very disjointed and awkward, and there’s no emotion from her. We don’t see any genuine smiles from Melania, it feels like a smile she has adopted for the occasion.”
Stanton continued: “There’s not the level of emotion you’d expect given her husband has just been elected president. It’s all quite contrived, she’s just reluctant to show any emotion, there’s no real happiness or joy. There’s always an awkwardness with Melania.”
Trump and Melania
Trump’s approach to virtually everything since he announced his intent to run for election the first time around has been to bull forward, come what may, with little to no disregard for what happens to others. Melania, I believe, has become just one of the many victims… swept up in a maelstrom of momentum she can’t escape, forced to sit, humiliated, as her husband’s infidelities and glaring character flaws are dissected on the world stage.
To all the ladies out there, I ask you this: Would you seriously sit idly by if it came to light that your husband had an affair with a former porn star (the aforementioned Stormy Daniels) and then tried to cover it up with hush-money payments?
That’s not to mention the draconian abortion laws he supports – laws, I might add, that Melania outright admitted she didn’t stand by in her memoir. And that’s just scratching the surface of what Melania has been put through during her time as convicted felon Donald’s better half.
I get it… at this stage it feels like it’s too late for the Slovenian-born beauty to turn back. There are some who will say that she’s made her bed, and that she should lie in it. And yet with rumors insisting that it’s unlikely she will make the White House her full-time residence, despite the fact her husband is the PRESIDENT, one has to beg the question… is there really any love there at all?
Or is this, as I suspect, a front to polish the image that Trump – contrary to every ounce of evidence we have – is a god-fearing family man who is dedicated to his wife and wants nothing more than to selflessly improve the lives of all around him?
Call me radical, but I think Melania should have long since divorced that man and had the courage to strike out on her own.

"A Scout (in some countries a Boy Scout) is usually between 11 to 18 years of age. Because of the large age and development span, many Scouting associations have split this age group in a junior and a senior section.

"Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu announced that Ankara is seeking to safely return Syrian refugees to areas controlled by the Syrian government, and not only to safe areas in northern Syria.
In an interview with a local channel on Friday, the Turkish FM said: “We want to return the Syrians to the places controlled by the regime as well, not just to the safe areas.”
Cavusoglu indicated that this issue was discussed with the Syrian government within the framework of the so-called Quad-like grouping with Russia, Iran, Syria and Türkiye.
“We agreed at the recent meeting of foreign ministers in Moscow held on May 10, to prepare the infrastructure in order to send the Syrians safely to the places controlled by the regime, and we decided to form a committee at the level of deputy ministers with the participation of the concerned institutions as well,” he noted.
“In other words, we are already determined to send the Syrians back. Secondly, we do not do this with a racist discourse, we do not forget that they are also human,” Cavusoglu added.
Recently the Syrian refugees file topped the political agenda in Türkiye, which headed Sunday for a decisive runoff vote after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan could not win the presidential race in the first round. He will face the leader of the main opposition CHP, Kemal Kilicdaroglu.
Ahead of the runoff, Kilicdaroglu stated that Türkiye would deport 10 million refugees and immigrants immediately if he wins the polls through negotiations with the Syrian government, European Union, and United Nations to ensure their voluntary and safe return.
For his part, Erdogan spoke a few days ago about the return of more than a million refugees to the areas controlled by Türkiye and its allied factions of the Syrian National Army (SNA) in northern Syria.
Meanwhile, Türkiye has launched the construction of nearly a quarter million housing units to resettle refugees in opposition-held northern Syria.
“Syrian refugees living in Türkiye will settle in the houses... as part of a dignified, voluntary safe return,” Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said Wednesday at the launch of the project.
He said that “240,000 houses will be built"" in the region, expressing hope that the project would be completed in three years.
On Friday, Cavusoglu said in his television interview that almost 553,000 Syrians had returned to areas where terrorism had defeated northern Syria.
He also pointed out that most of the Syrians in Türkiye want to return to their country, and stressed “the need to implement this process within the framework of international and Turkish laws.”",0.9760350584983826,567,1.455195665359497

Dabbing 101: A Foreword on the Legal Landscape 🌍
As we delve into the world of dabs, the question that often presents itself is: Is dabbing illegal? Dabbing, a method of consuming cannabis concentrates, has become increasingly popular due to its potent effects. However, with this rise in popularity comes a complex web of legal implications. Understanding these is crucial, not only for those who partake in dabbing, but also for those curious about the process.
Whether you're interested in learning how to make dabs, how to smoke dabs, or even how to smoke dabs with no rig, it's essential to first comprehend the legality of your actions. After all, the side effects of smoking dabs extend beyond the physical - they can have legal consequences too.
From THC wax to different types of wax dabs, from how to make dabs from keif to the use of liquid weed, the realm of dabbing is vast and varied. But before we explore these topics, let's first dive into the legality of dabs - a subject that is as diverse and multi-faceted as the dabs themselves.
Decoding Dabbing: The Art of Smoking Concentrates 🎨
Dabbing is a method of consuming cannabis concentrates, which involves heating a small amount of the substance on a hot surface, typically a nail, and then inhaling the vapors produced. The main substances used in dabbing are THC wax and other cannabis concentrates. These concentrates are often more potent than traditional cannabis flowers, leading to a more intense experience.
How to make dabs, particularly from keif, involves a meticulous process of extraction, purification, and often, compression to create a concentrated product. The resulting dabs can be smoked in various ways. The traditional method requires a dab rig, but if you're wondering how to smoke dabs with no rig, there are alternatives such as using a vape pen or even a regular pipe.
However, it's important to note that dabbing can have side effects. The high potency of cannabis concentrates means that the side effects of smoking dabs can be more pronounced than with other forms of cannabis. This can include heightened feelings of euphoria, but also potential negative effects such as anxiety or paranoia.
Given the potency and complexity of dabs, is dabbing illegal? The answer depends on where you are in the world, as the legality of dabs varies from country to country and state to state. This makes understanding the legal landscape of dabs crucial for anyone considering this method of consumption.
Global Gaze: Where in the World are Dabs Legal? 🌐
The legality of dabs is a global patchwork of laws, reflecting diverse cultural attitudes towards cannabis concentrates. In Canada, for instance, the Cannabis Act of 2018 legalized all forms of cannabis, including dabs. The story is similar in Uruguay, where cannabis and its derivatives have been legal since 2013.
Contrastingly, in many parts of Asia and the Middle East, the laws are stringent. In Japan and Saudi Arabia, possession of any form of cannabis, including dabs, can lead to severe penalties, even imprisonment.
Meanwhile, some countries have adopted a more lenient approach. Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001 and instead focuses on treating drug use as a public health issue. Similarly, in the Netherlands, while not entirely legal, the sale of cannabis concentrates in coffee shops is widely tolerated.
So, is dabbing illegal? The answer isn't black and white. It varies significantly depending on where you are in the world. As such, it's crucial to familiarize oneself with local laws before learning how to make dabs or how to smoke dabs with no rig. Remember, the side effects of smoking dabs extend beyond the physical; they can have legal consequences too. To stay updated on the latest cannabis laws, you can check out this guide.
Before exploring the world of THC wax, types of wax dabs, or liquid weed, make sure you're not stepping on the wrong side of the law. You can find more information about the legality of cannabis in different states in this article.
To give you a better understanding of the global landscape, let's take a look at a map that highlights the varying legality of dabs in different countries.
Now that we have a global perspective, let's narrow our focus to the United States and explore the legality of dabs state by state.
Stars, Stripes, and Dabs: The U.S. Dabbing Laws Unveiled 🇺🇸
Now, let's dive into the heart of the matter: Is dabbing illegal in the U.S? The answer is, it's complicated. The legality of dabs, like many aspects of cannabis law, varies from state to state. In states where cannabis is legal for recreational use, such as Colorado and California, you can freely dab your favorite types of wax dabs, from sand to diamond, without fear of legal repercussions.
However, in states where cannabis is only legal for medical use or completely illegal, the situation is much different. For instance, in Texas, possession of THC wax or any cannabis concentrates can lead to felony charges, regardless of the quantity. Even knowing how to make dabs from keif or how to smoke dabs with no rig could potentially land you in hot water.
It's also worth noting that the side effects of smoking dabs, such as impaired cognitive function and potential for dependency, can further complicate the legal landscape. So, while the allure of liquid weed or the potency of THC wax might be tempting, it's essential to understand the laws in your area before you dive into the world of dabs.
Legality of Dabs in U.S. States
To give you a clearer picture, we've compiled a table that outlines the legality of dabs in various states across the U.S.
State | Legal Status of Dabs | Legal Consequences for Possession |
California | Legal for recreational use | No legal consequences for possession under 28.5 grams |
Colorado | Legal for recreational use | No legal consequences for possession under 1 ounce |
Texas | Illegal | Felony charges, regardless of quantity |
Florida | Legal for medical use | Felony charges for possession without a medical card |
New York | Decriminalized | Civil penalty for possession under 25 grams |
Arizona | Legal for medical use | Felony charges for possession without a medical card |
Illinois | Legal for recreational use | No legal consequences for possession under 30 grams |
Ohio | Legal for medical use | Misdemeanor or felony charges for possession without a medical card |
Georgia | Illegal | Misdemeanor or felony charges, depending on quantity |
Washington | Legal for recreational use | No legal consequences for possession under 1 ounce |
As you can see, the legality of dabs varies greatly from state to state. This variation is influenced by several factors, which we will discuss in the next section.
Behind the Gavel: Factors Shaping Dabbing Laws ⚖️
As we delve deeper into the world of dabs, it's crucial to understand the factors that influence their legality. One such factor is the concentration of THC in cannabis concentrates. While THC wax and other types of wax dabs are often praised for their potency, this very characteristic can lead to legal complications. In certain jurisdictions, the THC concentration in your stash could be the difference between a slap on the wrist and a serious legal consequence.
Another significant factor is the intended use of dabs. For instance, in some states, you can legally possess and use dabs for medicinal purposes, but recreational use might land you in hot water. How to make dabs, how to smoke dabs, and even how to smoke dabs with no rig can be legally murky areas, especially if you're not well-versed in the local laws.
Finally, the quantity of dabs you possess can also impact their legality. In many places, personal use quantities are tolerated, while possession of larger amounts can lead to charges of intent to distribute, which carry far more severe penalties. So, before you dive into the world of dabs, it's essential to consider these factors to avoid any unwanted side effects of smoking dabs - the legal kind.

Risky Rips: The Legal Pitfalls of Dabbing ⚠️
The question, is dabbing illegal, is not straightforward to answer. The legality of dabbing, like many cannabis-related activities, can be a murky territory. If caught dabbing in areas where it's prohibited, the repercussions can be severe. It's important to understand the current laws regarding marijuana legalization in the United States to avoid any legal issues.
Legally, you could face hefty fines or even imprisonment. The severity of the punishment often depends on the amount and types of wax dabs you possess, and whether you know how to make dabs or were caught in the act of dabbing. In some places, like Florida, making or using dabs could be considered a felony.
On a personal level, the consequences can be even more devastating. You could lose your job, especially if you're in a profession that requires regular drug testing. Your reputation may suffer, and in some cases, you could even lose custody of your children.
Beyond these, there are also health risks to consider. While many enjoy the intense high that dabbing offers, it's important to remember the side effects of smoking dabs. These can range from minor issues like coughing and increased tolerance, to more serious problems like dependency or mental health issues.
So, before you learn how to smoke dabs with no rig, or how to make dabs from keif, take time to understand the legal landscape. Be aware, be safe, and always respect the laws of your jurisdiction. If you're planning to travel, make sure to read about traveling with CBD and the associated laws and regulations.
Final Puff: Wrapping Up the Legality of Dabbing 🎁
Before we delve into the nuances of the legality of dabs, it's vital to understand what dabbing is. Dabbing, a method of consuming cannabis concentrates such as THC wax, involves heating the concentrate on a hot surface and inhaling the resulting vapor. This technique can be modified to smoke dabs with no rig, though this may alter the experience and potential side effects of smoking dabs.
Now, is dabbing illegal? The answer isn't as straightforward as one might hope. The legality of dabs varies significantly across the globe, with some countries embracing its use, others decriminalizing it, and yet others enforcing strict prohibitions. Even within the United States, the laws are a patchwork, with the legality of dabs hinging on factors like THC concentration, medical versus recreational use, and personal possession limits. To understand the current state of marijuana legalization in the US, you can refer to this guide.
Understanding these laws isn't just a matter of curiosity. The legal consequences of dabbing where it's illegal can be severe, ranging from fines to imprisonment. But beyond the legal repercussions, the personal consequences—such as potential side effects and addiction—should not be overlooked.
In essence, dabbing is much more than just knowing how to make dabs from keif or understanding the types of wax dabs. It's about understanding the rules, the risks, and the responsibilities that come with it. So, before you dive into the world of liquid weed and dabs, make sure you're fully informed. Because when it comes to dabbing, ignorance isn't bliss—it's potentially a crime. For more information on the legality of cannabis, you can check out this article.

"Wildfin Financial Services founder and executive director David Mantiziba (24) is planning to expend more loans to sole traders and women-led small to medium enterprises this year.
In an interview this week, Mantiziba said his firm has established a niche market by serving previously marginalised groups.
“Apart from heeding the government’s call for financial inclusion, we have gotten a lot of business from SMEs, tuckshop owners, and other small businesses that most microfinance institutions avoid.
“When dealing with SMEs and sole traders we are aware of the risk exposure. As such, we meticulously screen every application we receive.”
Mantiziba said he was looking forward to the speedy implementation of the collateral registry system by the central bank to ensure that the new initiative can be put to use in the immediate term.
The collateral registry system, which allows the securitisation of movable property, was launched in December last year. The system has been in the making since 2017 and is part of the central bank’s financial inclusion agenda.
The collateral registry system is expected to centralise the database of movable assets accepted by banks and microfinance institutions (MFIs) as collateral for secured loans.
Mantiziba recently hogged the limelight after being listed in the Institute of Corporate Directors of Zimbabwe (ICDZ) 40 Most Influential Young Leaders in the country.
ICDZ honoured the 40 under 40 most prominent young leaders excelling in their respective areas of trade. The event ran under the theme ‘Rewarding Valiant Leadership in Volatile Times’ and was held in Harare recently.
Mantiziba is an excelling young entrepreneur, who has steered the microfinance institution from its humble beginning into the institution it is today. Wildfin Microfinance now has branches across Zimbabwe and expanding its footprint into the region.
The microfinance institution is already establishing offices in Zambia. Wildfin has made a name for itself by providing business and salary-based loans mainly to civil servants across Zimbabwe.
Apart from Wildfin, Mantiziba is also one of the owners of Eazi Apps company which is in partnership with a UK-based firm. Eazi Apps is a tech company that develops mobile apps and software.
With Eazi Apps, Mantiziba and other partners have expanded their operations to countries like South Africa.
In an interview after the ICDZ event, Mantiziba shared the secrets to his success at such an early age.
“All you need is to be a trustworthy person especially when dealing with investor’s funds. This calls for discipline and character.
“Mentorship made me achieve most of the things l have done. Mistakes that my mentors made are my greatest advantage as l am not falling into the same trap. I am privileged to have Nigel Chanakira, Rinos Mautsa, Shacky Timburwa, and Adelaide Chikunguru as my mentors.”
Mantiziba also said he has a great team at work which has helped to successfully run the organisation.
“l am lucky to have the best team which works 24/7, highly committed to lifting our brand name. One of the key issues is to know your numbers and be able to interpret them. Figures are always commutating with us and we don’t listen.
“We thank ICDZ for the nomination. We will not end here as a company. Our goal is to expand our service offering and serve the African region. We are in the process of building a billion-dollar group of companies in Africa.
According to the latest Zimbabwe Association of Microfinance Institutions (Zamfi) report, credit-only microfinance institutions served 135 620 active clients as of December 31, 2022, a decrease compared to 161 375 in the prior comparative year, a new report has shown.
Zamfi said the decrease in outreach was an indication of low and marginal efforts being done with respect to financial inclusion as far as credit is concerned.
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has for the past decade pushed for the country’s unbanked population to participate in the formal economy by encouraging innovation in the financial technology sector.
Financial inclusion helps formalise the informal sector and reduces the extent of shadow banking. It thus provides an improved framework for monitoring and supervision of financial transactions and, in turn, shields the customer from malpractice and the financial system from unwarranted shocks.
The uptake of formal banking products has increased to 46 percent in 2022, from 30 percent in 2014, with mobile money playing a pivotal role in the increased uptake and usage of financial services and products in Zimbabwe and in making the financial sector more inclusive – HARARE",0.9626155495643616,981,1.2875304222106934

"One of the notable historical sites in ancient Ispidzhab, now part of the southeastern outskirts of Shymkent in southern Kazakhstan, is the mausoleum of the standard-bearer Abd al-Aziz. Sayram itself is rich with mausoleums and monuments from the medieval period, some widely known—like the tombs of the parents of Sufi master Khoja Ahmed Yasawi, who was born here—while others remain less famous. The Abd al-Aziz Mausoleum, however, is well-known, with locals—even children—ready to guide visitors there.
Abd al-Aziz Bab is venerated for his courage in the mission to spread Islam in the Turkestan region. His life is mentioned in the Treatise on the Saints of Madinat al-Bayda and Ispidzhab, written in the early 18th century, which lists him among the virtuous Muslims and companions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). According to legend, he lived about 300 years before the birth of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi. Historically, the conquest of Central Asia by Qutayba ibn Muslim during the Umayyad period in the early 8th century is recorded. Although Turks and Sogdians initially resisted, they later voluntarily embraced Islam after the Battle of Talas in 751, uniting with the Abbasid governor of Khorasan, Abu Muslim, to decisively defeat the Tang Empire’s forces.
Locals are convinced that in northern Sayram lies the grave of a man who was the standard-bearer of the first Muslim army to arrive in Central Asia during the caliphate. “Abd al-Aziz Bab was the alamdar (flag bearer) of Ishaq Bab’s first Muslim army,” they say. Legend has it that Ishaq Bab arrived in Turkestan in 767, following the Battle of Talas. He appointed a local warrior, Tukty Shashty Aziz, as his deputy, marking the beginning of widespread conversion among the Turks to Islam. Both Ishaq Bab, mentioned in Safi al-Din Orunkoylaki’s Nasab-nama, and his standard-bearer Abd al-Aziz—recognized as a tabi’un (successor) in the Treatise on the Saints of Madinat al-Bayda and Ispidzhab—became preachers, dedicating their lives to educating the local population in Islam, and they are revered as saints (awliya).
Historical records on Abd al-Aziz as a standard-bearer are scarce. One version suggests he died in battle during the region’s Islamization. However, the fact that his grandson, Sayyid Khodjahan, is also buried in the mausoleum suggests that Abd al-Aziz settled down and lived his later years in Central Asia. If he had simply died in battle alongside other warriors without becoming a preacher, why would the locals choose to honor him with a mausoleum? After the Battle of Talas, a brotherly bond was established between the Muslim newcomers and the local population, making it unnecessary for Ishaq Bab’s group to enforce Islam upon the Turks.
The original mausoleum over Abd al-Aziz Bab’s grave is believed to date back to the Karakhanid era, between the 10th and 12th centuries. Later, the Shaybanid ruler Navruz Ahmad Khan (Barak Khan) constructed a new building on the old foundation. This structure also decayed over time, and the current building, erected in the late 1860s, has since remained standing.
The mausoleum dedicated to this saint received thorough study only recently. In 1982, it was added to the list of national historical and cultural monuments and remains under state protection today. Pilgrims from across Turkic nations and curious tourists on their way to Turkestan often visit Sayram first, the birthplace of the Sufi Khoja Ahmed Yasawi. The central part of the mausoleum is topped by a dome, and the interior consists of three interconnected halls with wide passageways. It is traditionally believed that Abd al-Aziz Bab’s grave lies in the northern part of the mausoleum.

"In the recent past, cyber-attacks have increased tremendously with flaws in software and hardware making it easy for cybercriminals. It is common to read reports of massive data breaches, Ransomware, and IoT attacks. Cyber-attacks have gone a notch higher and it is common to find highly funded cyber warriors who are paid to compromise critical infrastructures, gather intelligence, steal intellectual property and technology used in defense to mention a few. Organized cyber criminals have caused havoc all over the world and one of the latest victims is an American IT company called SolarWinds.
The recent massive cyber breach left many systems running SolarWinds Orion software exposed and others compromised. The Cyber Unified Coordination Group (UCG), a joint security investigating team from all security departments, was formed to investigate one of the largest cybersecurity attacks on critical federal government arms and other private networks. Approximately 18,000 SolarWinds Orion customers were affected directly according to the preliminary investigation by UCG. APT29, a Russian hacker group, was suspected to be behind these attacks after much investigation.
How it happened
This was a typical example of what is called a supply chain attack where a third-party service provider is targeted by hackers to launch an attack in organizations that have procured their service. Due to high-security measures that have been put in place by government agencies and private entities in defending data and networks, cybercriminals are now using vendors to launch attacks on these entities as opposed to attacking them directly. With sophisticated tools, they can easily exploit vulnerabilities in hardware or software supplied by third parties and gain access through them to penetrate the network and IT systems.
Take the example of SolarWinds, the attackers exploited a vulnerability in one of the Orion software update processes and installed a malware called SunBurst as part of the vendor package. It was installed in the victim’s systems and it waited for a few weeks before it could become active. This malware was designed to remain for a long time in the system without being detected through hiding as a legitimate Orion Service. It would in the meantime collect commands that are used in these systems and communicate over HTTP to predetermined Urls where attackers could gather more information on their targets.
The attackers would then use stolen credentials to log into the systems remotely and deploy customized backdoor tools (unauthorized access into the system). They would then sit in the system patiently while studying the environment waiting for the right moment to strike. The UCG investigations concluded that the attack could have been ongoing for several months before it was finally detected. Cybercriminals who are well funded can stay under the radar collecting and gathering information before they can finally attack and if they don’t get caught organizations will not notice they are being attacked.
Below is a diagram showing how SolarWinds Sunburst attack was perpetrated
Figure 1 SolarWinds Sunburst attack
SolarWinds Response to Sunburst attack
All companies that develop software or manufacture hardware are prone to supply chain attacks. SolarWinds being one of the biggest tech company’s producing monitoring software for large corporate and government entities, they became a prime target for these attackers. After this attack, the company started its own internal investigation and came up with the following measures to stop further attacks on its software. These measures which were disclosed by SolarWinds CEO Mr. Sudhakar Ramakrishna in the company blog;
- Revoking of code signing certificates that were used to sign the compromised software versions from March 8th
- Consolidation of both remote and cloud access to the SolarWinds network and enforcing multi-factor authentication.
- Use of other third-party security tools for analysis of the source code for their Orion platform software
- Hiring penetration testing services for the company to easily identify any security issue arising across its portfolio.
- Deployment of additional threat detection, protection on the entire network which also includes its production environment.
- Setting up a team of experts to help clients who might need to upgrade or apply updates hotfix on their Orion Platform product without incurring any charges.
How to prepare for similar cyber attacks
Cyberspace continues to grow and it’s therefore important for every organization to be well prepared in case of an attack like SolarWinds. Criminals are consistently acquiring a lot of skills and infrastructure and it is therefore impossible to block such attacks entirely. However, it is possible to detect the likelihood of an attack in the future by following these security best practices;
- Testing of Information Technology Systems that are used in corporations to assess whether they can be exploited or the measures which should be taken to minimize risk exposure.
- Develop patch management plans where patching is done in a test environment before it can fully be deployed on the system.
- Demanding security measures from third-party vendors to be put in place and before any vendor is brought on board due diligence should be conducted.
- Implementation of in-depth defense and zero-trust security models can help in easily detecting attacks in case one security measure fails to do the same.
- Implementation of multi-factor authentication means even though an attacker has stolen user credentials it will not be easy to access organization resources with other methods of verification used in MFA.
It is clear from the SolarWinds case study, any organization is prone to attacks at any moment and the damage can have far-reaching consequences. Solarwinds became one of many victims of cybercrime and surprisingly, many other companies could be in a similar position it’s just they are not aware of the attack launched against them. This security breach has exposed many companies and government agencies and damaged SolarWinds’ reputation. It’s therefore, necessary for organizations to learn their deficiencies early and establish actionable improvements which should be done regularly.
SolarWinds and other companies that were compromised by this attack have probably some of the best cyber defense teams. Unfortunately, the Sunburst malware was still able to find its way in many networks without being noticed until it was too late. This attack has exposed how susceptible organizations are to hacking and therefore the need to put critical controls in place.

"In March 2014 the European Commission published a report entitled Macroeconomic Imbalances United Kingdom 2014. The text includes a few observations on the UK property market that have been greeted with less than enthusiasm by the UK Government.
The report includes the following introduction:
“The United Kingdom continues to experience macroeconomic imbalances, which require monitoring and policy action. In particular, developments in the areas of household debt, linked to the high levels of mortgage debt and structural characteristics of the housing market…”
The report points out that:
- House price inflation continues to outstrip the Consumer Price Index by a wide margin.
- The main driver of house price inflation is demand for properties outstripping supply.
- The Government Help to Buy scheme and continuing low interest rates have increased availability of mortgage funding.
- House price inflation is highest in London and the South-East. Property owners in other areas of the UK would be particularly vulnerable to interest rate increases.
Recommendations to deal with the potential over-heating in the UK property market include:
- Increase the supply of housing.
- Reform of the Council Tax system
- Release of more land for development
The concluding statement of risks associated with the property market are reproduced below:
“In conclusion, levels of activity remain below previous peaks. Nevertheless, house prices are rising and the increase in prices and level of activity is likely to be reflected in rising levels of mortgage debt (and that rise is occurring from an already elevated base). The main risk on the demand side is households' vulnerability to a rise in the cost of borrowing while the response of the authorities has mitigated risks associated with an excessive lowering of credit standards. The main risk on the supply side is that reforms to the planning system and other initiatives to increase supply do not deliver increases in new housing of the amount required, or do so sufficiently quickly, to forestall further rises in house prices and mortgage indebtedness.”",0.9542272090911865,398,2.4035286903381348

"About the Work
Luscious Lady Takes a Stroll in the Lush (2023) by Alake Shilling is the artist’s first and only hand-finished series. A true blend of thoughtful original touch and innovative print edition, our first collaboration with the artist is an organic extension of Shilling’s multi-disciplinary practice, created alongside her 2023 solo exhibition A Bug’s Life at Jeffrey Deitch Gallery.
Luscious Lady Takes a Stroll in the Lush incorporates key elements of Shilling’s larger body of work: diverse textural narratives that playfully reconfigure material boundaries à la sculptural paintings and painterly sculptures. Each print in the series features 3D epoxy adhered molds created by Shilling in her Los Angeles studio through an experimental process of layering plastics and UV gels. Additionally, each unique work includes a combination of meticulously applied glitter, painted acrylic embellishments, holographic foils, and UV-printed spot varnish coating the lips and shell of Shilling’s fantastical ladybug.
Alake Shilling (b. 1993, Los Angeles, CA) has a forthcoming 2024 solo exhibition at the Palm Springs Art Museum. Other solo exhibitions have been held at Jeffrey Deitch (Los Angeles and New York) and Laura Owen’s 365 Mission (Los Angeles). Select group exhibitions include presentations at Anthony Gallery (Chicago), Museum of Art and Design (New York), NSU Art Museum (Fort Lauderdale), Hammer Museum (Los Angeles), Rubell Family Collection (Miami), Karma (Los Angeles), Night Gallery (Los Angeles), LOYAL (Stockholm), Steve Turner (Los Angeles), and Josh Lilley (Los Angeles). The artist lives and works in Los Angeles, California.

"- All the language packs available for Windows 10. Microsoft does a good job at representing Asian and African languages, especially compared to some other tech companies, though I can’t speak to the quality of the translations. Note that some of these languages require English (either variant) to be set as a base language for them to install.
- Google’s accessibility overview for Android developers.
- Over the course of 2018, Microsoft will be adding more accessibility features to Windows 10, including eye control navigation improvements, expanded accessibility settings and new input options for users with disabilities.
- Towards the end of 2017, AssistiveWare added localisation for Dutch and Flemish to Proloquo2Go, alongside English, Spanish and French. After adding these Dutch-language localisations, AssistiveWare made the app available in the Dutch and Belgian App Stores. There’s a good overview of the app on Communiceer (site is in Dutch).
- An overview of the accessibility features in Ubuntu Linux.
- Information about how to make Debian Linux more accessible.
- Online Connections sells an Australian English exclude dictionary for MS Word to force it to allow only preferred Australian spellings. For example, if you want to allow only realise and not realize, entering realize into the exclusion dictionary will treat it as an error. MS Word’s British and Australian English dictionaries allow both –ise and –ize spellings, since both are technically allowed in British and Australian spelling. Matthew Goodall of New Horizons Learning Centres gives instructions for users to create their own MS Word exclusion dictionaries for other forms of English. (Incidentally, I disagree with Goodall that towards and grey are uncommon in American usage; towards seems to be the most common spoken form in all English dialects, and grey is pretty common, too. American dictionaries list them as secondary options, just as realise is listed as a secondary option in Oxford University Press dictionaries for British English, despite its being more common in everyday use.)
Dropbox has been called out here before for date format foolishness, but they seem to be improving their internationalisation ever so slowly. If you look at the language drop-down, there are two English options now – hopefully that means English date formats will no longer default to Month/Day/Year. (They’ve also done it right by retroactively labelling English US for what it is, instead of having ‘English’ and ‘English UK’.) I want to say Latin American Spanish was added recently too, but I could be wrong.
iOS 9 has added some new language features, including a new Chinese system font, dictation support for more languages, Finnish and Korean spellcheckers, French/English and German/English bilingual dictionaries, improved Japanese autocorrect, predictive text for a variety of languages including Korean, Russian and Turkish, Canadian English and Canadian French user interfaces, and the option to switch between Arabic and Hindi number systems (h/t Multilingual Mac).
OS X El Capitan (10.11) has just added some new Eastern language support features as well, including the same Chinese system font that is now in iOS 9. There’s also new dictation for Arabic and Hebrew. No news of any new French, English or Hindi localisations – it’s Apple’s inconsistent internationalisation, yet again (and out of step with their other products and other operating systems).
Windows 10 had some localisation-related fail during the upgrading process, that required people to set their OS to English (US) in order to upgrade it properly. You shouldn’t have to change your system language in order to upgrade your computer, especially if you don’t speak English as a primary language. Good job, Microsoft. (That was sarcasm.)
Proloquo2Go is now available in Spanish! More info. There are bilingual English/Spanish children’s voices included with the new Spanish localisations, which are probably targeted towards the large bilingual Latino/Hispanic community in the US. (Interestingly, the boy’s voice has a recognisable Spanish-speaking accent when speaking English, whereas the girl’s voice has a recognisable American accent when speaking Spanish.) Adult voices come in Castilian Spanish and Latin American Spanish versions.
People on any region format other than US will not be able to see Apple’s News app on iOS 9 until iOS 9.1 – and I think that’s just for the UK and Australian region formats. (I know people are saying ‘people in other countries can’t see it’, but it’s tied to region format, not geographical location; anybody can set their region format to any country or language they want on an iOS device, and it doesn’t even have to match the UI language. You can set your region format to one language and have your phone set to a different language and your keyboard on another. Remember that when you set up an iOS device for the first time, it asks your language and region separately. I’ve seen screenshots of phones set to English but the region format set to Turkish.)
Skype In Your Language is a community-supported project for Windows and Linux that provides Skype localisations for languages and dialects that aren’t officially part of Skype releases. Not for the Mac, unfortunately – there’s no easy way to do unsupported localisations on OS X.
TalkTablet is an AAC (Assistive and Augmentative Communication) app that comes in iOS, Android and Kindle editions. It’s also available in multiple languages, unlike Proloquo2Go which is only available in English and Spanish.",0.9310569763183594,1178,1.9271857738494873

"FEMA is a regulatory mechanism that enables the Reserve Bank of India to pass regulations and the Central Government to pass rules relating to foreign exchange in tune with the Foreign Trade policy of India.
FEMA served to make transactions for external trade and easier – transactions involving current accounts for external trade no longer required RBI’s permission. The deals in Foreign Exchange were to be ‘managed’ instead of ‘regulated’
The main Features of FEMA regulations are:
- Activities such as payments made to any person outside India or receipts from them, along with the deals in foreign exchange and foreign security is restricted. It is FEMA that gives the central government the power to impose the restrictions.
- Free transactions on the current account are subject to reasonable restrictions that may be imposed.
- Without the general or specific permission of FEMA, MA restricts the transactions involving a foreign exchange or foreign security and payments from outside the country to India – the transactions should be made only through an authorized person.
- Deals in foreign exchange under the current account by an authorized person can be restricted by the Central Government, based on public interest generally.
- Although selling or drawing of foreign exchange is done through an authorized person, the RBI is empowered by this Act to subject the capital account transactions to a number of restrictions.
- Residents of India will be permitted to carry out transactions in foreign exchange, foreign security or to own or hold immovable property abroad if the currency, security or property was owned or acquired when he/she was living outside India, or when it was inherited by him/her from someone living outside India.
Generally, FEMA and RBI regulations are quite complex to understand and implement and any noncompliance with exchange control regulations lead to a huge penalty. Therefore, it is very important to take the advice of professional and expert firm’s dealing with such matters on regular basis.
In this regard, we provide our services relating to FEMA and RBI regulations as under:

"Accelerometers in smart devices have been used to successfully provide valuable information such as early warnings of earthquake activity and health monitoring of buildings. The next important step of using the acceleration measurements from smart devices is to assess building seismic damage, which is a more challenging application. A main challenge is related to the sliding motions of smart devices, which prevents acceleration measurements from directly representing the movement of underlying building floors. To detect and remove sliding motions in acceleration measurements, this paper presents an accurate and robust accelerometer-based stick-slip motion classification framework based on machine learning techniques. Three types of machine learning algorithms are introduced, and their classification performance are compared; support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perception (MLP), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). For the SVM and MLP, three classification conditions are considered: feature selection, non-linear discriminating analysis and classifier comparison. For the RNN, three hyperparameters are considered to find the best performing classification algorithm. Each algorithm is trained and validated with experimental acceleration data from a shaking table test.

"The storied “swing voter” has long been portrayed as key to electoral victory in the battleground state of Ohio. Much as Moby Dick’s Captain Ahab obsessed over the white whale, traditional democratic operatives have obsessed over reclaiming the lost white (usually working-class and male) voter. However, grassroots organizations like the Ohio Organizing Collaborative reject a singular focus on chasing on-the-fence voters.
“All of our work is focused on electorate expansion,” said Molly Shack, co-executive director of the Ohio Organizing Collaborative. The organization sees the real “swing voters” as the people who go back and forth between voting and not voting, and not the “Obama-Trump voters” who switched between the two major parties in 2012 and 2016. A central question for the organization is how to talk to people left out by traditional political engagement, focusing on advocacy around “issues that impact our lives day to day,” according to Shack.",0.9682291746139526,208,1.5849043130874634

In 1965, the virgin soil cricket facility hosted a first-class match between Ireland and Scotland that resulted in a Scottish win by innings and 22 runs. In 1995, the venue hosted a Women’s One Day International between Ireland women and the Netherlands women.

In 1996, the ground hosted three Women’s One Day Internationals when Ireland women played New Zealand women, 1997 when Ireland women battled South Africa women, and in 2000 when Ireland ladies played Pakistan females. The club cricket team Pembroke Cricket Club plays at the venue, as do Monkstown Rugby Union Club.

The Irish National Lottery has twice donated toward the club to develop the ground further. In 1997, £65,000 helped build a new pavilion with changing rooms and administration facilities. In 2003, following completion of the work over ten years previously, another €50,000 allowed for an extension to be built on the existing facility to include two more changing rooms for visiting teams to use. These also included new showers and toilets.
Records On This Ground
The venue hosted an Irish Senior Cup match between Pembroke and YMCA in August 2011, with the home side winning by five wickets. The ground has also made way for a number of other sports in recent years including football. In 2012, it was announced that Irish women’s international soccer player Stephanie Roche signed for French club ASPTT Albi after impressing during a preseason trial at the ground.

Mixing High-Low Fashion: what it is and how to do it?
This week, we are giving you the 411 on mixing High-Low Fashion: what is it and how do pull it off – and, in addition - our Fairy Gay Mother, Nolan Meader, is back to help us!
GET THE NEW EPISODE HERE!
A Disclaimer: Holly starts off by saying this is not her usual “Fashion Over 40” style rant. This is a fashion topic for anyone of any age or budget. Most anyone can pull this off!
Also: be sure to head over to Holly’s Pinterest Board to follow along as you listen.
So, this isn’t as simple as one might think. There is a way to pull this off that looks seamless and classic; not trendy or tacky. This is something that people started to do then got creative and made how-to videos about it. I will say creating a high/low look is really broken down into two buckets.
If the words “I hate to shop’ are in your frequent vocab, this isn’t for you.
In addition to the advice and style info that we are about to give:
This really isn’t for a beginner or
someone who has just started a style journey. This is for someone
who already has great style who is trying to EVOLVE their style.
Your style should be evolving with your age.
If your style isn’t evolving or you’re stuck in a style rut, this will be great motivation for you to get that fashion energy moving back in your life. It’s kinda like your furniture and your tchotchkes. If you don’t move them around occasionally, the energy in the room gets stale.
So, let’s start there and break it down.
Let’s first talk about the difference between high-end and low-end fashion items.
It might seem obvi, but we want to make sure we are all on the same page. What personal stylists might consider a high-ticket item would be something that starts probably at $500-600 dollar range and up.
Low-end would be $100 or less. Anything in the middle say over $150 would be considered moderately priced. This isn’t written in stone, it’s just what we consider high and low.
How to Buy It:
If you love to shop but don’t know what to shop for, then start here. Designer, high-end pieces can be acquired from stores at full price, or second hand.
We’ve talked about this before, how you can go to secondhand luxury websites and buy something even with the tags still attached.
People who want to regularly rotate their wardrobe will buy and sell second hand. It's a great resource for the fashionably fickle person who always wants something new and it’s even better for the environment. So that’s a great reason right there to shop second hand.
When you shop high-end, the best place to put that money is going to be in the accessories. Accessories usually means, bags, shoes, jewelry, belts, scarves, hats, etc. These are the items that you can tell are high-end. You don’t want to waste a ‘high-end’ piece on say like a pair of black pants. You want the high-end pieces to be subtle but recognizable and the low-end pieces to blend with a sense of ease in conjunction with the rest of your look.
A person who achieves this look correctly will have someone look at them and not be able to tell which pieces are low end.
That’s how you pull off a High/Low look! Yay!
Buying high-ticket items can be intimidating and daunting, but once you shop around and research what you are looking for, then you will feel better about spending the money. Most people with a financial block around clothes don’t see the value of why things cost what they do.
There is a reason that things cost what they do, and clothes are no different. Everything from the stitching to the fabric to the actual pattern it takes to make the garment makes a huge difference. This is the reason why we are constantly talking about shopping for fit first instead of for color or for price.
When you shop for fit, you will have a better product that you can wear longer. Things that fit better on your body will probably cost you more.
Let’s use Holly as an example. She has never, ever been a person who cares about bags or purses. She bought what she though was cute at a cheaper price and never gave it a second thought.
Once she met Nolan, who is a terrible influence, btw, he taught her why her bags didn’t work and how it cheapened the rest of her look. She started to buy higher-priced bags and then really got it.
Carrying a nicer bag can make you look much more polished and professional. #truthbomb
The next high-end statement pieces are shoes. No matter what your high or low pieces are, shoes are the most telling statement you can make. Fine, high-quality shoes say “high” no matter how “low” you go. #seewhatididthere
So, how low should you go?
Notice we didn’t say how low you can go; we said how low should you go.
When you see something cool and trendy, like a T-shirt, that can be low-end. If you are into T-shirts or like wearing them, a great way to shop for them on the cheap is to shop vintage.
For example, Rock-n-Roll, authentic tees can be pricey, but something similar like a knock-off band tee is something you can do on the cheap. You can look at vintage stores in your area or look at websites like ThreadUp and Etsy, or even Urban Outfitters has a vintage section. This is a great way to mix it up.
“You could put a vintage Rock-n-Roll tee under a blazer with designer jeans and shoes, and a moderately priced bag with costume jewelry. That’s a great way to mix high and low.”
Another way to shop low-end is with denim. Levi’s are a perfect way to get a great jean at a great price. There are other companies like Good American and Madewell that have jeans that are priced moderately and have a great product for less.
Once you have great basics on the lower end its super easy to mix with high end to create a perfect high/low mix.
See my Pinterest board here for more ideas! DOOO ITTTT.
Nolan’s Note of Week:
High needs to be “high” to pull off the High/Low look. Take your best pieces and combine them with a trendy low piece. The focus needs to be on the High. Not the Low.
Or he’ll beat you with a menu from Cipriani. And we aren’t kidding. He was very passionate about this.

"The Bedford Food and Wine Festival took place for the third time this year, held on the first weekend of September—a perfect choice. The warmer weather made it far more pleasant for wine tasting than the chilly days of last year’s mid-winter event.
Small towns in the Eastern Cape, like Bedford, don’t host many events throughout the year. Locals often describe the social scene as quiet, but when events like this do come around, it’s surprising how many residents don’t attend. Thankfully, visitors from out of town make up for it, giving the local economy a much-needed boost by drawing travellers to the area, who might not otherwise have reason to visit.
Having represented Featherstone Brewery at many events over the years, I can confidently say that the Bedford Food and Wine Festival is one of the most enjoyable, fun, and educational experiences. Vintners from select estates in the Western Cape—many of whom travel over nine hours to attend—bring wines that are often hard to find locally, as much of their production is exported. This year, a new addition to the program elevated the event even further: The Duke Hotel curated a food and wine pairing menu in collaboration with the winemakers, offering bite-sized dishes matched perfectly with selected wines. This multi-sensory experience turned an already special event into something unforgettable.
As a beer brewer, my focus is naturally on beer, but after interacting with winemakers, it becomes clear that the art of crafting fine alcoholic beverages—whether beer or wine—has many similarities. Both are judged on key sensory components such as aroma, appearance, flavor, mouthfeel, and finish, and these criteria shape how judges, and ultimately consumers, appreciate them.
- Beer: The malt, hops, and yeast are key contributors. Depending on the style, judges detect aromas ranging from fruity esters to spicy phenols.
- Wine: Fruit character, oak influence, and aging qualities define the nose. Judges look for a balance between primary fruit aromas and secondary aromas from fermentation or aging.
- Beer: Clarity, colour, and head retention are critical. A hazy ale or a crystal-clear lager must visually align with the style’s expectations.
- Wine: Colour intensity and clarity are just as important. Reds range from ruby to garnet, while whites vary from pale straw to gold. The “legs” on the glass may signal alcohol content and body.
- Beer: Judges assess the balance between malt sweetness, hop bitterness, and any additional flavours, such as spices or fruit. Fermentation also brings unique esters or phenols to the table.
- Wine: Wine flavour hinges on fruitiness, acidity, tannins, and alcohol balance. Harmony between sweetness and acidity or tannic structure is the goal.
- Beer: This covers the body, carbonation, and texture. Beers can range from smooth and creamy to crisp and effervescent.
- Wine: Mouthfeel in wine is influenced by tannins, acidity, and alcohol. Red wines may feel velvety or drying, while whites are often light and crisp.
- Beer: Judges note how long the flavours linger. Some styles should have a clean finish, while others leave a lasting bitterness or sweetness.
- Wine: A long, pleasant finish is highly prized, especially in fine wines, indicating balance and complexity.
Arguably, the hardest part of evaluating beer or wine is describing the sensory experience in a way that fellow tasters, judges, or even casual drinkers can relate to. For example, consider this description of a wine’s flavour:
“The first sip reveals a lively, crisp acidity that balances the wine’s medium body. Citrus flavours—lemon and lime—dominate the attack, while green apple and a touch of ripe melon develop on the mid-palate. The oak influence is subtle, offering a creamy texture with a faint touch of butter and toasted vanilla. The fruit remains the star, supported by just enough oak to enhance without overwhelming.”
While we may not all be connoisseurs, taking a moment to appreciate the craftsmanship behind a fine beer or wine can deepen our enjoyment. Sometimes, we might just gulp something delicious, but at other times, it’s worth savouring the finer details.
A huge thank you to the Duke of Bedford for graciously hosting such a prestigious event, to the winemakers who travelled such a long distance to share their craft, and to the organizers for inviting Featherstone Brewery and pulling everything together so smoothly. We look forward to seeing everyone again in 2025!",0.9401172995567322,973,1.1441878080368042

"Once again we find ourselves in a nationwide debate about women’s reproductive rights and bodily autonomy. We know that inherent to our well-being is the ability to make informed decisions about our healthcare. And not only is our physical health at stake but taking away our right to choose when or if we will have children can contribute to both short and long-term mental health challenges.
What are women’s reproductive rights?
A woman’s reproductive rights give her the ability to decide if, when, and how she will have a child. Some women choose to wait until they are more financially secure or complete their education, some prefer to foster or adopt, and others may choose not to have a child at all. Reproductive rights give us this choice. The right to choose has a positive impact on a woman’s salary, stability, and overall health.
Women’s reproductive rights have a long and complicated history in the U.S. One of the most well-known court cases, Roe v. Wade, granted women the right to an abortion in 1973. In the years following, we’ve seen women’s health improve in many ways.
Over the past few years, however, some states began setting more and more restrictive laws regarding a woman’s right to choose. The most recent headlines about overturning Roe v. Wade are deeply concerning because overturning this law not only undermines our equality but agency over our bodies. It’s a slippery slope, and the implications for our well-being are profound.
How restricting women’s reproductive rights impacts mental health
Restricting a woman’s right to choose has a direct impact on our mental health. Research tells us that anxiety and depression increase when we lose control of our reproductive rights. Worry and fear about the future can permeate all aspects of life, from day-to-day tasks to intimate relationships. Even though contraceptives are helpful to prevent unwanted pregnancies, there are situations where a woman can still become pregnant after taking every precaution. It’s a loss of control that changes our lives not only for a few months but for years to come. And, if you’re not in a place where you’re ready or able to provide for a child, the consequences can be devastating (not to mention the lack of maternal health resources in certain parts of the country).
Victims of domestic abuse are also more at risk with restrictive abortion laws. Either through psychological coercion or as mandated by a court, a woman may stay in contact with her abuser over the fear of losing support or feelings of obligation, putting both herself and the child in harm’s way.
One research study, known as the Turnaway Study, cites that providing access to abortion services has a positive impact on women’s mental health and wellbeing. Participants in the study, through a series of questions, voiced anxiety and stress when told they could not access an abortion (for the study). On the other hand, 84% of women who were free to choose an abortion shared “positive or few emotions about their decision” five years after the procedure.
Make no mistake, the study did not state that deciding to have an abortion is easy. Often it is not. Sometimes it is the most difficult decision a woman can make. What the study does highlight is the positive, long-term impact of the right to choose for women’s mental health.
How restricting women’s reproductive rights impacts physical health
Knowing that our mental and physical health are inextricably linked, we’d be remiss not to touch on the impact of denying our right to choose on our physical health. This is where many of the laws surrounding abortion, such as Roe v. Wade or state fetal heartbeat laws, become murky. Medical issues such as cancer, heart disease, and ectopic pregnancies are a direct threat to a woman’s life. If she’s pregnant, however, her care team may delay treatment to preserve the life of the fetus to the detriment of her health. While doctors will act to save the mother’s life if complications arise, it’s not always in time to prevent further physical and emotional distress.
Why women’s reproductive rights are essential to our wellbeing
Choosing to have an abortion is not a decision we expect to make until it confronts us face to face. It’s not something we plan for in advance. That’s why, even though it may not be easy to sit with these scenarios or fully absorb the implications of overturning Roe v. Wade, it’s not something we can ignore. There are direct consequences to our mental health and well-being by taking away our agency and telling us what we can and cannot do concerning our bodies. As friends, mothers, daughters, and sisters, we must look out for one another—and our rights.",0.951874852180481,1009,2.972921371459961
"When you think about adoption, what do you imagine? If you’ve seen any older movies, you might envision that adoption involves dropping your baby off on a doorstep. But modern adoptions are nothing like this!
Adoption is a pregnancy decision that is full of options, depending on your goals and desires. It’s also a parenting decision because you are making the choice to provide a loving future for your child.
There are three types of adoption plans: open, semi-open, and closed. Learning as much as you can about these adoption plans and the process more generally can help you decide if this is the right choice for you.
How Does Adoption Work?
Adoption is the process of carrying your pregnancy to term and giving your parental rights to an adoptive family so that they can raise your child. An adoption agency or attorney will walk you through all the legal implications of adoption and ensure that your goals and desires are kept at the forefront.
A multitude of difficult feelings can surround adoption, which is why it’s critical to speak with an adoption counselor. An adoption counselor will walk you through the adoption process, give you the space to ask questions, and ensure that you understand what this decision might look like in your life.
What Are the Types of Adoption Plans?
An adoption plan is essentially a document that outlines your goals and desires for the adoption process. There are three different adoption plans, and each is customizable, depending on what you want to happen:
Open adoption: As the name suggests, this is the most open option. An open adoption is the plan you’d choose if you desire to have open communication between you, the adoptive family, and your child. Open adoptions are currently the most popular. They allow you to build a long-term relationship with your child.
Semi-open adoption: This plan is similar to open adoption, but all communication is mediated between a third party, like an adoption agency.
Closed adoption: With this type of adoption plan, you won’t know anything about the adoptive family, and they won’t know anything about you. This type of adoption plan is rare today, but it might be a good fit for your situation if you need to remain anonymous for any reason.
We’re Here for You
Thinking about your different pregnancy options can feel overwhelming. We understand. But you’re not alone in this. At Fempower Medical, we’re here for you. No matter what decision you’re considering, we’re here to give you the information, services, and support you need to move forward confidently.

"SoulShift: The Measure of a Life Transformed **E-BOOK**
We want to be different, but we don't want to change. Our attempts at spiritual formation and growth are consistently sabotaged by our surface efforts that never quite get to the root of the problem. We think we know what we're supposed to do, but we're not quite sure who we're supposed to be on the other side of transformation.
In SoulShift, Steve DeNeff and David Drury offer an approach to spiritual transformation which focuses less on measuring how much time we are spending on spiritual inputs?such as Bible study and prayer?and more on measuring who we are becoming in Christ.
Christians at any stage of life will experience a fresh beginning in following Jesus. You will learn about seven key transformational shifts that occur in the minds, hearts, and behaviors of every true follower of Christ. And you will receive practical help for bringing about these shifts in your own life.
Let Christ free you from guilt-driven spirituality to experience the measure of a life transformed.
SoulShift: The Measure of a Life Transformed is accompanied by a series of companion Bible studies and a SoulShift Family Ministry Kit that enables pastors and church leaders to implement SoulShift as a whole-church program.

"Grillo, known for portraying Brock Rumlow/Crossbones in the MCU, is set to take on the role of Rick Flag Sr. in DC’s upcoming animated series ‘Creature Commandos’. Moreover, the show will be DC’s first project after the reboot and will premiere on Max on December 5, 2024.
Frank Grillo Says He Felt Like A Minor Cog In The MCU
While James Gunn’s revamped DC Universe will fully kick off with ‘Superman’ in 2025, ‘Creature Commandos‘ serves as an exciting precursor. In an interview with Screen Rant, Frank Grillo expressed his excitement about being deeply involved in the franchise from its beginning stages.
Unlike his time in the MCU, where his character often served as a “minor cog” in a larger machine, Grillo emphasized that his new role allows him to engage meaningfully with the storyline. Reflecting on his experience, Grillo explained what sets his DCU journey apart.
“It’s just being really involved in such a great way from the beginning. So, I have a chance to be in the embryotic stages of this in a big capacity, and not just used as a plot device and then shunned away,” he shared. “In this thing, you can’t do it without Rick Flag Sr. The way James has set it up, and that is really, to me, important, and I’m grateful for it. I take it very seriously,” he added.
Grillo’s words hint at the depth and complexity his character brings to the table. Rick Flag Sr. is a foundational figure in the DCU’s emerging tapestry, with a storyline integral to the overarching narrative. Unlike with the MCU’s Crossbones, Grillo feels empowered to fully explore his character’s potential in the DC Universe.
He also expressed gratitude toward James Gunn and Peter Safran for their collaborative approach. “Whatever you guys got planned, I’m game,” he stated.
Frank Grillo Says Rick Flag Sr. Will Be The DCU’s Nick Fury
Frank Grillo also confirmed that Rick Flag Sr. is set to have a long-term presence in the DCU, akin to Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury in the MCU. The character is already confirmed for appearances in ‘Creature Commandos’, ‘Superman’, and ‘Peacemaker’ Season 2.
Moreover, each iteration will present different aspects of his motivations and personality. “Based on how things end in Peacemaker, in Superman, and in Creature Commandos, Rick Flag will be around for a while,” Grillo told Inverse. “I kind of liken him to the Sam Jackson character in the Marvel world.”
In case you missed it: Frank Grillo Claims He Was Almost Fired “36 Times” By Marvel For Leaking Spoilers
The comparison sets high expectations, as Nick Fury has appeared in ten Marvel films and three TV shows. Grillo expressed confidence that Rick Flag Sr. would follow a similarly pivotal trajectory. However, he also noted the character’s appearances wouldn’t always align chronologically.
“You’ll see an older or younger Rick Flag Sr. appearing across the DCU timeline,” Grillo teased. “I could be totally wrong, but my gut tells me he’ll weave through a lot of different things,” he added.",0.961871325969696,757,0.9044808745384216
"Muffy's son's strengths are, obviously, in sports and music. Despite his love of animals, his strengths involving them are rather low, which is rather surprising. |
His main interests lie in animals and exercise. Though Muffy wants him to grow up to be intelligent, learning is neither one of his strengths or interests. Instead, he's inclined to grow up to be an athlete unless you influence him another way. |
Stages of Life
Note: Your child's personality will differ according to how you've raised him, meaning that your child will not necessarily turn out as listed here. This data is based off of Akie's own experience in the game.
Toddler Stage (chapter 2)
It's hard to keep up with this kid. He's all over the place. He'll go to the barn, the chicken coop, the pasture, the tool shed, the path leading to the spring, etc. He constantly talks about animals, and asks you if you like animals. (You can either tell him yes, no, or that you like him better than any animal.)
He tried to push his luck with his mommy once by staying out in the barn past his bedtime, and Muffy wasn't too pleased. But he didn't learn the lesson: right at the end of chapter 2, he decided to stay up by staying in the kitchen after 9PM. Muffy didn't discipline him for that one.
As regards personality, he must be a lot like Muffy was at that age. He's very outgoing, just like his mama.
Boyhood Stage (chapter 3)
He's still very outgoing and easy to spoil. He and Kate seem to be good friends, they're together fairly often. He's still obsessed with animals, and likes to ask you if running a farm is fun or not. He also started asking me about whether or not I thought I could outrun Wally. Of course, I don't think that would be possible, but it's fun telling him once in a while that his old man could beat a professional marathon man, hehe. ^^; (He didn't believe me, though. Darn.)
He also is developing an interest in art: he says that his mother often praises his work. Maybe a little too much. But Muffy must be enthralled to see him take such an interest in something other than animals. Cody seems to think he has artistic talent, too.
He's very fond of eggs and milk.
Teenage Stage (chapter 4)
He's going through the awkward and rebellious stage, poor kid. The main thing on his mind right now is no longer animals or art, but girls and bodybuilding. He doesn't think he's handsome or strong enough for a girl from the city to like him. (Muffy thinks he must have a crush on someone.) He still likes animals, but thinks that taking care of them is just too much work...
He doesn't smile much, and is a lot harder to please than he was as a child. He will only accept certain things from the ruins and star milk now.
Adult Stage (chapters 5 & 6)
He's more or less reverted to how he was as a child: cheerful and mischievous. He still doesn't seem too likely to take over the farm... and he didn't. He became an artist. I guess Muffy and Cody were on to something when they said he had artistic talent, eh? He still likes to recieve certain things from the ruins and star milk.",0.9930397868156433,733,1.4202224016189575

"I’d like to hear from anyone who stains their Flow Hives - what you use, and how often you re-stain?
It really depend on which timber you Flow Hive is made of and how often you are prepared to treat it. If it is cedar then most opt for using tung oil to retain the natural timber look, if it is made of pine then painting it is the best option and white is the best option if you are in a hot climate to help the bees in cooling the hive. Painting should last 5 to 8 years before repainting is needed. Tung oil seems to last a shorter period, as short as a years in some reports. Any treatment you use it is all about preserving the timber by sealing it against water penetration into the wood, that is more important in my opinion than beauty/appearance.
Stains are not known to be a good wood sealer so it wouldn’t be my choice.
Thank you. Tung oil it is!!
How easy is it to re-oil annually?
What happens to bees?",0.9820956587791443,224,1.2835572957992554
"Hi, I tried my first splits this season and two out of the four finally got it going (eggs and nicely wet open brood). One other has eggs but some are not laid as you might expect (not centered, some multiples,… : laying worker or juvenile queen ?). The last one (who I thought succeeded first - I found her before, marked her and found eggs later) still has only eggs, that is: the eggs don’t seem to progress to larvae ??
I’m I looking at frames with older eggs than I think they are who are neglected by the nursing bees, or what can be the reasons there is no brood in this one yet ?
I gave these two a sealed queen cell from another hive to see what would happen…
If the eggs aren’t hatching, it would be because the nurse bees aren’t placing larval food on them. Eggs wont hatch without larval food first. Do the bees need feeding? Are they bringing in pollen & honey?
Not all splits are successful at producing a new queen. It’s best to intervene quickly with a fresh frame of brood before laying workers start. If you have any doubts whatsoever, don’t hesitate to add a fresh frame of brood. It wont do any harm, even if you do have a queen that is slow to start.
Hi Jeff, thanks for your insight. It got me thinking that most of my bees in the splits are perhaps too old by now to nurse the eggs to larvae. I started with cellpunches (no diary still but now is definitely a good case to start), than some control frames, and the current possibly viable queen would probably be from a rescue cell.
maybe I can shake some young bees from other hives to rejuvenate? Should I replace the frame with eggs or do they stay viable as well? Hard to see/ check what are new eggs and what are old (bees don’t seem to clean out)
I think even older bees will nurse. The best thing to do would be to add frames of brood that contain mostly sealed & emerging bees, as long as some eggs are also present. That way, you’ll get nurse bees in the coming days.
I see lots of talk on the forum about the age of bees etc. I never give that much thought. Maybe I do subconsciously, while I’m adding brood frames that contain lots of emerging brood.
Hi Jeff, as frames need to be removed from the hive to put these replacement frames in, do you have advice as to which frames to choose to remove, and then what to do with them?
Hi Dan, I was thinking about this while I was out. The author of the thread could simply swap the frames over. Put the frame containing the unhatched eggs into the donor hive in place of the frame he took. The bees of a stronger colony will soon deal with it.
Unhatched eggs mustn’t be a real problem to a colony if weather suddenly turns bad. The bees can hold off on supplying larval food to the eggs until conditions improve. If the colony has a lot of young larvae that they can’t feed on account of circumstances, I guess they have to eat the young larvae before it dies & goes bad & smelly.
To further answer your question Dan, I just choose the frame that is the least use to the colony, remove it & arrange the rest of the frames so that the donor frame sits in the middle of the bee cluster. The removed frame can be left out or added to another colony. You just work it out as you go.
Thanks Jeff. I’m sure your explanation will be of much help …
Oh, Jeff, do I understand it correctly than that eggs can last/hold for longer than the “classic” 3 day cycle; I mean eggs are not lost if they didn’t develop to larvae at day 4 (yet). The feed trigger was never on my radar before, thanks for pointing me to that.
They have plenty of food and stores in that split, and they share the same conditions as with the other hives who all 4 keep producing brood all be it at a slower pace.
Little bit of extra feed wouldn’t do harm I guess.
Will let you know how they respond to the new mixed frame that will show me the acceptance of the queen cells I introduced earlier as well.
Yeah, I read that in the ABC to XYZ of Bee Culture. When I read that, I remember thinking about how that fits with nature. Then I recently learned how bees eat brood, so I immediately wondered how that fits in the natural world also.
I remember reading how eggs wont hatch without what they call “larval food”. But how long an egg stays viable for, I have no idea.
I put in a frame with open and closed brood, very curious what they will do with it - they lady is still in the house, she wasn’t hard to spot this time as she was on my shoulder all of a sudden out of nowhere; cheeky
but still all I can see are eggs everywhere (at least two frames both sides in a 6 frame nuc) since two weeks at least.
No rescue cells, they seem quite happy with their queen, and rightfully so: she’s pretty, big, blackish, laying plentyful … but not a single egg hatching. I’ve heard of “taube Eier” in German literature, like ‘in vain’, or deaf, empty, without purpose. Haven’t found a solution yet… maybe the only solution would be replacing her.
If she wasn’t fertalized at all, would she be laying ? - she was born quite early in the season, local drones available and I have one of the few Belgian professional beekeepers around so in the hundreds of hives (so plenty of ‘foreign’ drones)
Even replacing gives me some worries: do they clear the frames full of eggs for the new Q or should I give them empty frames ? this nuc is slimming fast, so the easiest would be joining with another hive I guess…
Every time I open a hive, there is something the girls are doing something different than the books say … one amazing hobby
Even a big, pretty, blackish laying queen can be a dud queen. If you have doubts about her, what you could do is kill her & leave her body there, then introduce another frame of brood, or even two that contains mostly sealed & emerging brood, but importantly also some fresh worker eggs or young worker larvae for them to start making emergency queens with.
There will be no need to unite the colony as long as you have brood frames you can add to it.
I would have thought that if she was un-mated then the unfertilized eggs would result in drones?
Curious to know what the hive with the next queen will do to the current eggs. I’ll let you know
The first preview page of this article already learns you a lot. That it is a rare condition and that nurse bees are not the issue, nor is the sperm…
Tomorrow this split will receive a new queen cell",0.9671766757965088,1511,1.8271818161010742
"We live in a temperate climate in Victoria BC (Canada) with hot summers in the 20s to low /mid 30s Celsius, beside the Pacific Ocean.
It recently got hot - 26 degrees - as summer is starting. We installed a 5-frame nuc 3 weeks ago and they are doing well with now a total of 6.5 of 8 deep frames drawn and lots of honey, pollen and brood in them. So an increase in 1.5 frames.
The bottom board below the screen is set currently in the top position. Now that it’s warming up should I move it to the lower position? What should my decision be based on?
Hi Maureen, I would leave the slider in the top slot. The bees, in my view will air condition the hive more effectively without added ventilation. My theory is based on the information in the video found on you tube entitled “City of Bees” by the Moody Institute of Science.
Hi Maureen, there is lots of discussion about when to move the board, Jeff has answered you pretty well. The bees will control the hive temperature in everything but the extremes.
Here in a sub-tropical climate we would call 25c cool so it is all relative. Leave the board where it is is my advise along with Jeff.
Sounds like your hive is going well.
Thank you to both of you, @JeffH do @Peter48. Much appreciated!
My pleasure to pass on information to people in need Maureen. Thinking further on your climate I would leave the slider board where it is in the top slot permanently. The bees will do any adjustments to the hive temperature themselves by fanning their wings at the hive entrance if it gets too hot for them, but I wouldn’t think you have the climate for that to happen.
Jeff lives 30 minutes drive from me and is a wealth of well thought out information and a nice person as well. He certainly knows his bees.
I would say to leave it sealed. Think of it this way, the bees work hard to cool the air. Its cooler and denser so sinks. If you open the bottom their cool air just drops out the bottom of their hive so they have to start work all over again. In hot weather I have a baffled top opening with fly screen to allow gentle ventillation but never a screened bottom and we regularly get over 40 degrees in summer.
I live in the foothill country of the Cascades S.E. of Seattle. We are getting same same temps (after I converted). I leave my slider in the top slots year around. That lower slot isn’t for us. That lets in too much cooler air n causes the bees A.C. Issues…
Our bees keep the hive at appro. 94 dgs F for best laying n brood rearing. If the need it cooled you should see breeding (lots of bees hanging out on the front porch or front of the hive. This is very normal n a unique experience your first few times. Bees will bring water inside the hive n fan to create air circulation n the cooling they want. Be know BEST !
I have two Flow-hives n 7 other SBBoard hives. In our moderate climate it’s not good to lower ! All this has been discuss somewhat on here in the last few days as the Wx warms up across the Northern Hemisphere.
Sounds like your colony is doing well. Do you have a second deep super with frames ready to go one soon (not the Flow-super). In our northern climate you’ll need that second box to supply your girls with their winter needs of honey .
As you know we have a long gray damp, cool winter up here so 60 to 80 lbs of food us needed for the girls to safely survive. Are the large wild blackberries in full bloom up there yet. My local blackberries are at about 70 to 80% our here now. Hoping for a longer 3 week blackberry forage thus 2018 season.
Cheers n good luck ,
Thanks, Rob. That’s a good perspective. We all feel we are wilting if it hits 33 degrees here.
Thanks, Cascadia neighbour! That’s super helpful. And yes some of our bees are bearding - have been for maybe a bit less than a week? So that was helpful, too.",0.9468154311180115,906,1.8745015859603882
"My budget is $600, but I am willing to go up to $650. I live in the US, and in Michigan, with access to Microcenters. I will most likely only use it for gaming, and the heaviest games I will probably play would be GTA V or Skyrim, but mostly I will be playing TF2. I'd like to play these with the highest settings possible with this kind of budget. I will not be using this PC for anything else really, except for browsing the internet. I do not want to overclock. My mouse grip is palm, and my keyboard doesn't require anything other than having a satisfying ""click"" sound every time I press a key. There is no preference for monitors. And I want Windows 10 for my OS.
Yeah, one slight problem with the G3258: It's a dual core. Games that can utilize more than 4 threads (which'll inevitably be becoming more abundant sooner or later) will run better on the 860k - have a look at the benchmarks for battlefield hardline here. Plus, given that some games will lock you out for having less than four cores, I don't think that's a great route to go down.
Also, nice storage solution. 250GB? I mean IK it's an SSD but still, not much room. lol
Thanks for the help from the both of you. I'll be checking these builds out and trying to do some research to add onto this.
And yes, if you could get me a mouse and keyboard that suits my needs, I would appreciate it.
This might do then, if you're wanting windows and a monitor that is: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/GkyMHx
If it's just a mouse and keyboard, idk what to go with - that's a pretty subjective decision, although with the keyboard you'll probably only really be able to grab a rubber dome set within that budget without spending 10-15% of it on the keyboard alone. Same goes for the mouse, you really could do with going and trying a few out.
EDIT: changed that, got a cheaper case for some more RAM.
So do you recommend going with your first build or your second build. I want windows, but I don't really need a new monitor.
Would be a mix between the two if you don't need a monitor:
Leaves you ~$22 for mouse+keyboard.
Check the benchmarks I posted. The G3258 is the better choice for gaming now and leaves room for easily upgrading in the future. You can't get better than the 860k with FM2+, but with 1150, you can easily drop in an i5 and be done with cpu upgrades for a good long while.
Except until we're halfway through the next generation of intel chips, then you'll find it hard to get hold of an 1150 CPU. It's not like this thing's going to be bought and upgraded in a month or two. By the time it'll be being upgraded both the motherboard and CPU will probably be done away with.
Here is my idea For a good budget build as it stands it is 800 dollars with the monitor and OS included. It is all up to you if you want to cut back on some things for a even slimmer budget thats fine. All the parts are really reliable and optimized for gaming and should last for ages. The monitor is the best and cheapest ips panel i could fine (i know you didn't ask for one but it makes the experience much better). Anyway here is my idea for a good cheap budget build: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/XN7xvK
Would personally cut down on the motherboard (just needs to work, not going to be overclocking or anything crazy), drop the SSD to put more money into the GPU (I mean, seems a bit unbalanced having an SSD in a build with a 270X...) and grab some cheaper RAM (you can cut off almost $10 by going with a single 8 stick, which'll have no effect on gaming performance), but alright.
I really do appreciate the help, and there is merit for the G3258, but my friend and these two are recommending the 860K.
Thanks for the additional build and the critique, all of you guys are really helpful. I will continue to look into these, but at the moment I am caught up in something.",0.9709106087684631,916,1.0644450187683105

"so i watched one of ""the tek"" episode, dont remeber which one but logan mentioned about you can get a windows 8.1 legit copy for really cheap at forums? is that true ?
Yes and no - we had a seller on the forums here for a while, and although it seemed good at first - after a while everyone that bought a key found it was actually a scam. So as of then we do not support or condone selling keys on the forums. As far as where you might get one from, I'm not sure - someone else might be able to help but I have a feeling that you get what you pay for......
thanks for the info...:D
You can always pick one up on G2A.com for pretty cheap. They have a service where they guarantee you get a legit key. You can also pay through PayPal and get your money back if the key doesn't work.
Yeah, G2A is a great solution. However be sure to buy and activate the key before July 29th, otherwise you won't get the free windows 10 upgrade.
I think he said he bought a russian copy for super cheap or something like that.
I'm so cheap I'm using Windows 10 beta free
Yeah. You can just sign up for it on Windows Insider and they literally give you a free key for testing it.
i have never heard Logan saying anything about this.
Although you are technically correct, I suggest you interject the year e.g. July 29th, 2016. There is no rush for anyone to buy anything, as everyone has over a year to activate an upgrade to Windows 10.
He did so on the Tek.. obviously not recently with all the shenanigans going on with non-legit keys etc.
yeah long story short, all those cheap key deals you find online, seem to be a scam.
Microsoft blocks certain keys after some period of use.
i would realy recommend, if you ever stamp on such sales somewhere, do not fall into it.
On this community we are not allowing any key sales anymore.
I think I too remember him mentioning cheap copies of Windows from the forum. Not sure if it was on The Tek, though, could've been a build guide too. But it was way back (much like when he was recommedning the Kingston V300 before they changed them).
From what I have heard, if you haven't activated your windows license before the release of Windows 10 you won't be able to upgrade.

"I am looking for a better way to archive solutions to common problems here on the forum… as you may know it may be very hard to scroll back a year or more to find an issue we discussed, or common issues like bricked XIAO or why diodes are needed for external power… thinking of making a new catagory called solutions or something like that… but these catagories are also a mess… any ideas would be greatly apreciated
I don’t know about an Archive but maybe just add a solutions ONLY tick box in the search results. That way only posts marked as solutions will be returned.
That would be how I would add it as a feature, for folks to only search for SOLUTIONS!
thanks for the input!
Use subcategories to organize common topics (e.g., “Microcontroller Issues,” “Power Supply Solutions,” “Diode Applications,” etc.).
Thanks! Does anyone have topics they think would be a good example for this type of solution… i mean obviously the best thing would be to update the wiki… does everyone know where the wiki is and how to find product information?
So I see what your intending and I would think any “Solution” marked thread could be Tagged and then linked to a Product page or include a link to the WiKi for the TAG or checked solution…
The issue since the beginning of the forum IMO is the lack of categorization among the Xiao Family of MCU’s you can’t decerne a Xiao_C3 from a Xiao_nrf52 BLE thread unless the user includes it in the title and often Highjacks’ occur (guilty myself) may not be intentional when the same symptom or problem occurs on different models.
Start , there and you reduce the thread search count by the factor of (# of XIAO’s) in the family, like 8 or 10 ? I’m loosing track…
makes the most logical first step, then add a tick box for (include Solutions only) in the Search results.
ALso add more TAGs capable of tagging a post for a sub category like @liaifat85 suggests
yes… the only problem is what if i post what i want to eat for dinner… then you say Pizza and i mark as solution… it is kinda a good think to look at the whole thread… or just summarize the solution in a new post
Well it’s outside the ULA/TOA for the forum so in the perfect world it would be FLAGGED ! as Spam!
it would need to be started there and tested for some weeks, then link in the Wiki and Sales links stuff. The data is there, Search is the universal tool to be exploited , make search better/smarter and you achieve both goals. IMO without changing the front end and relying on users do all the qualifying (that never works) Git tried it and turned it off.
Categories and tags into the database that exists that way even old resurrected threads could be added and updated auto-magically be being red or referenced.
Only some are looking for solutions also, others just the latest info on a specific piece or feature. So that lines up with what actions should be taken to improve the quality of BOTH info and Problem Solutions.

What creates the icon for a speed dial icon? Only one of my pages (Tesco, a supermarket in the UK) has their logo in there. Opera just writes the address in text in the others, making them hard to find. Can I add my own icon? And how did Tesco manage?
hucker last edited by hucker
@hucker You can't set your own thumbnail but you can choose one of the available images when bookmarking the page.
If it's already bookmarked, open the page, click on the heart icon in address bar and choose an image there.
That sometimes works. But if the link isn't to the homepage of that site, the proper logo isn't there. For example if I have a link to ebay.co.uk it offers me the logo, but since I link to my list of purchases, all I get is the choice of: words, a screenshot of the whole page, or some random images that happen to be on that page, but for some reason not the ebay logo, which is actually on that page!
I even thought of making a speed dial link to ebay home page, so it gets the logo, then changing the address it goes to, but that removes the logo!

Rubbers are with high sugar and calories that can contribute to weight gain if they are excessively consumed. However, youngest studies have shown that rubbers can actually lead to weight loss from natural ingredients such as honey or fruit juice if they have a healthy diet and regularTraining routine followed.
One possibility of how rubber can help with weight loss is the fiber content. Rubber from entire fruits are often rich in fiber that can help you feel full for longer periods. This can promote too much and healthy digestion.

Recent studies indicate that the combination of Saxenda and healthy lifestyle changes can lead to even greater success.

Rubbers are typically made of gelatin that come from collagen - the connective tissue in animals. To produce gummy bears, the manufacturers often add sugar and artificial flavors to improve their taste. Maybe not always the healthiest option.

Although you may not be as tasty as gummy bears, you can still be an excellent tool for weight loss.

It has been clinically demonstrated that green coffee bean extract, which contains chlorogenic acid, increases metabolism, reduces the desire and promotes fat burning.

"French president’s winning baker hates France
Makram Akrout, winning baker of the Best Baguette in Paris in 2021 and future official supplier to the French President, filed a complaint after the revelation of ""hate"" and Islamist messages on social networks that he allegedly supported.
Published: October 2, 2021, 10:24 am
Akrout, a baker of Tunisian origin, won the traditional competition for the Best Baguette in Paris and obtained the right to deliver his bread to the Élysée Palace for a year.
Following this victory, the baker has repeatedly said that this award was “a great pride” and “no coincidence”. Makram Akrout arrived in France in 2002 without paperwork and was naturalized. He has been in the business for 19 years, he says.
A few days after the announcement of the results of the competition, some Twitter accounts unearthed messages from Makram Akrout’s Facebook account in 2019-2020, reported French daily Le Parisien.
Merci au lauréat du Grand prix de la baguette 2021, M. Makram Akrout de la boulangerie ""Les boulangers de Reuilly""- 54 bd de Reuilly pr son accueil chaleureux !

Written in Arabic and reposted on Facebook by a user named Makrem Akrout, these messages imply that the user supports the ultra-conservative Tunisian Islamist party. He shared conspiratorial ideas claiming that France wanted to “colonize” Tunisia and supported the petition to “fire” the French ambassador at the time.
“Mr. Akrout told us that his Facebook account had been hacked”, said Franck Thomasse, president of the bakers of Greater Paris and one of the members of the competition jury. His lawyer, Me Sylvia Lasfargeas, denounced a “nauseating” campaign mounted by “the extreme right”, adding that Makram Akrout disputed these “screenshots”.
Following these revelations, the baker decided not to receive his prize on October 2 in person. For her part, the leftist mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo, who will present the prize, “hesitated”, but will ultimately be present.

CLIMATEThe United States' government scientific organization, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), predicts zero sunspots from 2031 to 2040. This is an extreme situation that has not occurred in as long as humanity has been counting sunspots, and it leads us into uncharted territory in terms of our solar system. However, this prediction aligns with the warnings of the world-renowned solar researcher Valentina Zharkova for many years, who indicated in 2019 various signs of this catastrophic phenomenon, including the extreme hailstorms we have seen in Europe and the world this summer. The forecast and various observations this year give cause for very significant concern. In this unique analysis, Free West Media explains why.
EUROPEAN ELECTIONSOn Saturday, August 26, representatives of six European nationalist parties gathered in Budapest. The meeting was initiated by the Hungarian party Mi Hazánk and took place in the national parliament. Representatives of the parties signed a joint declaration that not only reaffirms the parties' friendship but also their unity on a range of complex political issues. A surprisingly clear and radical manifesto was established. The hope is that this cooperation will lead to success in the EU elections and eventually result in the formation of a group in the European Parliament. For Swedish nationalism, this meeting marks a success as Sweden, for the first time, has a party represented in a leading nationalist cooperation in Europe. Free West Media was present at this historic event.

The Russian attack helicopter Ka-52 is considered one of the world's best and has struck fear in Ukraine, where it has hunted down tanks and other armored vehicles, often beyond the range of many light anti-aircraft systems. However, it has met its match in the Swedish air defense missile system RBS 70, which has quickly led to significant losses for the Russian helicopter forces.
Top Researchers Push Back Against Climate Lies.""The correlation is as clear as day,"" explained the Israeli astrophysicist Nir Shaviv, who was hailed by the establishment, before his interview with Forbes was hastily deleted. What he says contradicts the climate narrative, which points to humans as responsible for Earth's climate. Shaviv firmly asserts that it is the sun that controls the climate, something that can be scientifically proven in many ways. Contrary to the popular belief, the sun's influence on Earth has, in recent years, caused unusually cold and rainy weather, a trend that solar researchers warn will worsen significantly in the coming decades. The sun has exhibited an unusually low activity since 2016, during Solar Cycle 24, which was the weakest in a century.
Alternative for Germany (AfD) held a party conference on July 29-30 to select candidates for the upcoming EU election next year. EU Parliament member Maximilian Krah, belonging to the party's more radical, ethnonationalist faction, was appointed as the top candidate. The party's two spokespersons delivered powerful speeches criticizing the EU's failed migration policy and trade sanctions that isolate Europe and Germany from the rest of the world. They argued that it's time for the EU to return a significant portion of its power to national parliaments. However, they have dropped the demand for Germany to exit the EU.
The rising popularity of AfD has raised strong concerns within the establishment. Despite lies and demonization in the media and isolation from the overall political establishment, the party continues to grow. Certain representatives of the party are accused of becoming increasingly ""extreme,"" and in an unusual move, the influential weekly newspaper Der Spiegel demanded that AfD be ""banned.""

"100% Pinot Noir: planted since the 15th century in the Jura, on gravelly soils, Pinot Noir is often blended with other varieties, for its flavour and cellaring potential. It covers nowadays around 15% of the Jura vineyards and gives red wines with a strong colour and hints of wild mushrooms, cherries and wild berries.
Used here as a single variety, it is perfectly illustrating the Jura vineyards interpretation as the sitxh Burgundy ""Côte""!
The wine shows a limpid dress. The nose is pleasant, straight and fine, revealing red fruits flavours. In the mouth, it is an elegant and rich wine with black fruits aromas and delicate spices notes. The well-marked yet velvety tannins bring structure and body.
Serve with beef, dishes cooked and marinated such as “coq au vin” or in accompaniment of a great plate of famous local Jura cheeses!
Serve ideally at a temperature of 14-16°C (57-61°F).
5 to 6 years.
The Jura wine region is small in size but large in its remarkable diversity. It covers 80 kilometers between Burgundy and Switzerland, in the eastern France.
Created in 1937, the AOC (designation of origin) of Cotes du Jura is omnipresent in the north and south of the vineyard, on varied and contrasting terroirs. It is the second leading AOC in Jura in terms of production, and it engages all five of the Jura's grape varieties. The whole range of wines of the Jura is represented, although the whites dominate - still or sparkling - with wines that are round, fruity, and generous.
This cuvée is made from grapes hand-picked from 3 parcels selected from among the finest terroirs in the Jura, in the village of Arbois, which are particularly well-suited to the Pinot Noir grape variety: ‘Grande Côte de Grillard’, ‘Casse-Cailloux’ and ‘Combe Leubet’.
The vines are grown at altitudes of between 280 and 350 metres above sea level on soils that alternate between marl and limestone residues. They were planted in 1999, 2001 and 2004 depending on the depending on the plot.
The work in the vines, is based on the respect of the nature and the soil. The Guyot double pruning is necessary for the Pinot Noir to better control its performance.
For young vines, located on steep slopes, to avoid erosion, we cultivate a row out of two, practice soil reassembly to aerate the lands subjected to settlement due to moisture, and grass with plants such as clover, which, by competing on the vine, can modulate its mineral and water supply and control its vigour and yield.",0.9484246969223022,599,1.6828718185424805
"Q: In your earlier lectures, you had many fascinating things to say about masculinity and femininity, and yet you barely touched on those concepts in The Psychology of Romantic Love. You wouldn’t consider addressing these concepts again in some future book?
Branden: I’ve learned never to say never, but I doubt it. Not that the issue doesn’t interest me; a lot of issues interest me. Right now a lot of research is being conducted in this area. Let’s wait and see what turns up.
I sometimes wish there could be a twenty-year moratorium on the words “masculinity” and “femininity,” and, during the same period, a far greater emphasis placed on self-acceptance. If we were all as honestly accepting of our natural inclinations as we knew how to be, without concern about cultural stereotypes of what was “appropriate,” I think we would see patterns of difference between males and females. I have strong opinions about what some of those patterns would be. But it would be interesting to let the evidence accumulate and speak for itself.
Many feminists, of course, have an agenda in this area, and wish on political principle to deny any significant differences between the sexes except the obvious physical ones. They want to insist it’s all a matter of culture and upbringing. I think reality is against them. Which doesn’t mean there isn’t plenty wrong with traditional sex roles. However, I think it’s foolish to imagine that our physical differences do not result in any psychological differences, at least as tendencies.
As an interesting aside, a psychological study isolated a group of men and women who by their peers were judged to be highly creative individuals. They gave this group a battery of tests and what they found was that creative men tended to exhibit a high number of traits the world calls feminine, and that the women manifested a high number of the traits that the world calls masculine. That doesn’t mean that the men were effeminate and the women were butch. But they seemed to have more of the traits commonly associated with the opposite sex.
I have an explanation for this, which is the following: highly creative people are at least in some respects more independent than the average person; they are much more attentive to their internal signals, and because of this, they are less likely to block off or disown pieces of themselves that don’t fit cultural stereotypes.
Q: There’s a lot of talk in psychology about the difference between men and women’s attitude toward sex and relationships—that when a man is younger all he thinks about is “nailing” a girl and all the girl thinks about is getting married. This is quite a conflict! What would you say to teenagers about viewing their sex lives, and understanding the other sex’s very different goals?
Branden: If we were more accepting of our own sexuality, and the sexuality of the opposite gender, I don’t think we so readily fall into adversarial postures. I think we could be more open and honest about our feelings.
I suspect we should not be so prone to treat each other as “objects.” Males tend to treat females as sex objects and females tend to treat males as success objects (to borrow a phrase from my friend Warren Farrell, author of a marvelous book on this subject, The Myth of Male Power). Just as lots of men like to “nail” (using your word) sex objects, lots of women like to “nail” success objects. We don’t relate as human beings. Alienation from the self inevitably leads to alienation from the other.
Q: One area where we’ve seen some evolution in your views is the issue of homosexuality. How did you see homosexuality in the past, how do you see it today, and why?
Branden: Today it seems clear that there is more than one kind of homosexuality—by which I mean there is evidence that in some instances people are born with this orientation, whereas in other instances it is learned, acquired during the course of development, and in other instances still, it is situational, as with people in prisons. Different explanations are needed, rather than treating all cases as the same.
In the past I described homosexuality as a developmental problem, which I think it is sometimes, but not always, not necessarily, so I prefer to avoid generalizations. Until much more is understood than is understood at present, I prefer to say nothing on the subject, especially since this is a field in which I am not a specialist or expert.
The only exception I will make is that I am convinced it is a major error to treat homosexuality as a moral issue. If I ever implied or conveyed anything to the contrary, I profoundly regret it.
Q: You’ve also conveyed that Rand did her admirers a disservice by her own moralistic pronouncements about homosexuality. What’s your perspective on this?
Branden: By treating homosexuality as a moral problem, all that is accomplished is to fill people with guilt for something about which most of them can do nothing. Now in therapy, if someone comes to me and insists that he or she genuinely wants to change from a homosexual to a heterosexual orientation, sometimes I am able to help, without judging the client’s choice, one way or the other. However, if a homosexual wishes to work on other problems and does not raise the issue of sexual orientation as an issue, I do not try to change his or her mind.
Ayn had the habit, unfortunately, of flinging moral pronouncements about which she had no knowledge to support her verdicts. So did I, at times. Not a good idea.
Q: After one lives with bad habits for 20 years, how does one change? Your books suggest sentence-completion work, but that doesn’t seem to be a very complete technology.
Branden: I have never suggested that sentence-completion work alone is a complete technology, although often it is a powerful force for change, as many people have discovered. Apart from the clinical practice I get a good deal of mail from readers who do the sentence-completion exercises I recommend in my books, and they report electrifying changes.
But in addition I do many, many other things—from various forms of psychodrama, to working with subpersonalities, to guided fantasy, to techniques adapted from Neuro-Linguistic Programming, to working with the person’s energy system, to all kinds of homework assignments, and so forth. What I do is much too complex to explain in an interview.
Q: Among the various movements in psychology and therapy what do you think of the “Iron John” movement? I had a friend who went through it, and I was very impressed with the things he told me. I was intrigued by their techniques of destroying a man’s false pride and helping him find to whom he relinquished his masculinity.
Branden: I’ve never read or met Robert Bly (author of Iron John), and I know only a little about the work he does. I can’t say it strikes much resonance in me but I do know men who find it enormously helpful, and I don’t dismiss that.
For many historical reasons, there’s great confusion today about what constitutes “masculinity” and “manhood.” Many of the old models no longer seem relevant. I see the issue as one of self-acceptance—forget social stereotypes. I’m convinced that if men have the courage to connect with the deepest parts of ourselves, they will discover their “masculinity,” just as women will discover their “femininity.”
Q: Do you think teenagers should experiment with sex or are they too immature to deal with such a complex issue, not to mention the problem of disease and pregnancy? At what age (generally) should a young person decide to have sex and under what conditions?
Branden: It’s not so much a matter of age as of psychological maturity. One can’t properly answer this question merely in terms of age.
The principle is, when people act, at any age, they need to know what they are doing, they need to operate consciously, and they need to be able and willing to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. This clearly excludes girls who get pregnant at 14 and the boys who impregnate them. But let’s assume a young couple practices birth control. Even so, one couple of, say, 15 or 16 might be fully equipped emotionally to handle sexual intimacy while another couple will not.
We live in a time of great irresponsibility and one manifestation of the irresponsibility is children having children and getting themselves diseased and passing that disease to others. There is no such thing as sexual morality. There is only morality. There is living consciously or not consciously, living responsibly or not living responsibly.
Q: What would you say to a man who says: “I’m a nice guy and because I’m a nice guy women aren’t interested in me; they go for these guys who leave them hanging by the phone. They don’t find me exciting.”
Branden: As long as there are girls with cold or rejecting fathers, a certain type of rejecting man will always have sex appeal for those females. That’s one part of the story. Let’s call it the neurotic part.
But there is another part that is less understood. There’s a story I like to tell men who are not especially self-assertive.
Many years ago I became friendly with a woman who worked in the same building, and occasionally we’d bump into each other in the elevator, and we’d end up having lunch together. She was dating a friend of mine at the time. So one day over lunch I said how are you and so-and-so getting along, just to make conversation. And she said: “I’m actually thinking of ending the relationship.” I said: “Really, if it’s not an invasion of your privacy, do you feel like telling me why?” She said: “Well, it’s really odd; I’m a fairly experienced woman, and he is by far the best lover I have ever known, and he is in many ways a terrific man to be with.” So I said, knowing I was about to learn something very interesting, “Then why are you ending the relationship?” She sighed, and she looked at me, and said: “Nathaniel, he’s too eager to please.” And I understood everything.
In other words he had such a desire to be liked or approved that there wasn’t enough male animal self-assertiveness in the relationship. He could be a marvelous lover, or a marvelous escort, but was missing something that she legitimately wanted. I wouldn’t call that neurotic on her part.
Q: While granting that self-esteem deficits lead to many other psychological problems, do you insist that “all” psychological problems are rooted in a troubled self-esteem?
Branden: If you mean caused by troubled self-esteem, and by that alone, no. If you mean, do we always find troubled self-esteem in the background, contributing to the problem in some way, often in a very basic way, the answer is yes, if not always, then a great deal of the time.
What I will say now is simply this. It is easy to see that many problems are a clear expression of poor self-esteem, such as fear of self-assertiveness, a habit of making self-deprecating comments, fear of change, novelty, or challenge, plus a good deal of anxiety and depression (although not all). And it is easy to see that many other problems are defenses against poor self-esteem, such as grandiosity, seeking always to control others’ behavior, focusing on popularity or material acquisitions as proof of self-worth, a habitual policy of putting other people down in order to lift oneself up, and so forth.
But to say that we can trace most problems to a troubled self-esteem is not to say that no other causal factor is involved. I need to clarify this point still further in some future writing project.
Q: On the subject of responsibility, what do you think of the practice of an unhappily married couple staying together “for the sake of the children?” Where does responsibility end and self-sacrifice begin?
Branden: A simple, general answer is not easy. There is no question that children suffer from divorce. It is also true that they suffer when the parents are always fighting and unhappy. And certainly responsible parents have to think about the impact on the children of their choices and decision. When children are involved—especially young children—self-responsible adults act slowly, thoughtfully, and non-impulsively. Their thinking does not stop at, “Don’t I have a right to my self-interest?”
Objectivism certainly teaches that we are responsible for the consequences of our actions. No one forces us to have children. If we elect to bring them into the world, we cannot walk away from our obligations to them merely because the obligations now feel inconvenient. But we also have a right to exist. And sometimes remaining in a marriage is so agonizing that we feel we must leave, if we are ever to have any kind of a life at all. I respect that right, too. So I do not condemn parents who break up a marriage, in spite of a possibly negative impact on the children.
What I cannot admire, however, is (a) parents who have children irresponsibly in the first place, (b) parents who walk away from a marriage without making every effort possible to save the situation, and (c) parents who do not think long and hard, and perhaps consults specialists, on how to minimize the suffering of children following the break-up.
There are three things never to do impulsively or mindlessly: get married; have children; get divorced. Of course, one shouldn’t do anything else mindlessly either.
Q: Leonard Peikoff said that it is all right to lie to someone if you think the truth is none of their business and is not owed to them. Do you agree? Is it ever morally permissible to lead someone astray with false information?
Branden: If you are being subjected to physical coercion or the threat of it, obviously you are morally free to lie to protect yourself and your possessions. We don’t owe honesty to someone pointing a gun at us.
When people ask questions that we perceive to be none of their business, it’s far better to refuse to discuss the issue than to lie. Better to point out, perhaps, that the question asked is none of the questioner’s legitimate business. Or to answer in a very general way that gives away nothing you don’t wish to give away. Sometimes nothing short of a lie will protect us, of course, and if the questioner truly has no right to ask what he or she is asking, I suppose a lie is defensible. But we are all on our honor here, because it is awfully easy to kid ourselves about what someone else does or does not have a right to ask.
What makes your question tricky, in part, is that you know, and I know, and many other people know—or at least we suspect—that Leonard developed this argument to legitimate Rand’s lying to everyone about her affair with me. She was demanding that Leonard and others in our circle damn me while withholding from them a vital piece of information that would help them understand what was really at issue. Once Rand asked her followers to damn Nathaniel Branden, she lost the right to claim that her full reasons and context were none of their business.
Not that she could always control herself. At the time of the explosion, in the summer of 1968, when my sister Florence met with Ayn and struggled to decide who to believe, she spent several hours in Ayn’s apartment while Ayn ridiculed the idea of an affair between us as absurd. But Florence persisted in her questioning, long after a loyal follower would have stopped—Florence was an admirer but not a true believer—and finally Ayn yelled that if I was the man I had pretended to be I would have been in love with her rather than with Patrecia. And then Florence knew that I had been telling her the truth.
Since Ayn insisted that she always took pride in her choices and actions, here was a chance to prove it. Why didn’t she repeat the statement she made to Florence, in the pages of The Objectivist? Why didn’t she say it to Leonard and the rest of our circle? Why didn’t she proudly assert her values and choices the way her heroes and heroines did? When I failed on this same account, it was properly regarded as a vice.
Q: At NBI someone asked if a person can be involved in two romantic relationships at the same time. You and Miss Rand replied that “Only giants can.” Considering the mess that the “giants” made, have you altered your view on this?
Branden: Today I would answer that people with a less grandiose view of themselves probably have a better chance of succeeding in such a project with some reasonable degree of sanity and balance. Ayn and I—who were operating totally out of reality—had no chance whatsoever. For further details about what is or is not possible in relationships, let me refer you to my Psychology of Romantic Love.
Q: Ayn Rand had a concept of the “ideal man” and she seems to have projected that concept first onto her husband and then later onto you—as if she could be in love with a man only if she perceived him as the embodiment of the “ideal,” irrespective of the man’s actual real-world traits. Is there a form of Platonism here?
Branden: Ayn one day admitted it to me, that if Frank had not looked as he did, she would never have fallen in love with him. Looks were terribly important to Ayn. I don’t mean that it’s wrong to care about looks. But Frank and Ayn were so profoundly different in so many ways. Whatever his virtues—and he did have virtues—I don’t think anyone can deny that he was passive, non-intellectual, non-assertive, and dependent.
Interestingly enough, it was Barbara who challenged me to look at Ayn realistically on this subject. One day, not long after the break, when I was trying to defend some aspect of Ayn’s behavior because of how hurt she was, Barbara said, “Nathan, be a psychologist. Look at Ayn as if she were a client in your office. She’s been in love with two men, and the first was passive and totally subordinate to her, and the second was a man, no matter what his strengths, twenty-five years her junior. What are the implications of that? Ayn needs to be in control. And look at how she behaves when she can’t be.” I was stopped dead in my tracks—because I saw that Barbara was right.
So, yes, Ayn did a lot of projecting, on Frank and on me, to justify and make sense of her feelings for each of us. There’s probably a little projecting in all relationships, but Ayn took projection into the stratosphere. She over-praised me many times. That was really harmful—and seductive. So long as I was “her” man, everything I did was “genius.” Very intoxicating to a young man.
Q: In Taking Responsibility, as well as in earlier writings, you acknowledge that destructive parenting can have a devastating impact on a young person’s development. In light of this, if one has a wounded or underdeveloped self-esteem, is it fair to regard oneself as immoral?
Branden: This is an important issue. Let me take my time with this. I will begin with an observation that virtually every psychologist would agree with: a person who thinks of himself or herself as “immoral” is likely to turn that judgment into a self-fulfilling prophecy, by engaging in behaviors that are immoral. That is why we warn parents against labeling children. In the immortal words of child psychologist Haim Ginott, “Labeling is disabling.” Label a child as stupid, or sloppy, or incompetent—and watch the child go out to prove you’re right.
If a client wants to tell me that, in retrospect, he now perceives something he or she once did as immoral, I do not challenge that, assuming it makes sense to me. But if the person describes himself or herself as immoral, I certainly do challenge it. I encourage people to see themselves as results of the choices they make, and if they do not like some of their past choices, I may encourage them to understand why they made them, and to explore what better choices exist for the future. I am more interested in where we’re going than where we’ve been.
Now if parents have treated us badly, and we have acquired some destructive behavior patterns of our own, I see no value in worrying about what was my parents’ “fault” and what is my “fault.” I am interested in: how do I do better in the future? And that is what I teach clients. A client preoccupied with self-condemnation is harder to help, not easier. Also, as I discussed in Honoring the Self, sometimes self-reproach is only a defense strategy, an excuse not to grow: “I’m no good, so expect nothing of me.”
Finally, I will say this: nobody ever improved by telling himself he was rotten—or by being told he was rotten. And boy, is that something Objectivists need to understand. Sometimes it breaks my heart a little when I get an Objectivist for a client, and he says, “I’ve got poor self-esteem, I’m immoral, I must be or else I’d have good self-esteem.” And I ask of what the immorality consists, and of course the client can almost never tell me.
The psychological roots of most problems are fairly complicated, a mixture of environmental factors, volitional ones, and sometimes even biological ones. It’s not always possible to know all the factors involved or how they relate, and fortunately in most cases it’s not necessary to know in order to get the problem solved. It’s painful enough to have the problem. What is helped by, in addition, tormenting oneself with self-reproach?
Apart from the fact that in this sphere we often lack the knowledge to make appropriate judgments, even if we had the knowledge we have to ask: What is our purpose here in making moral judgments? Is it just to make judgments for the sake of making them, to prove I’m a good Objectivist? Is it to help me overcome my problems and grow? Moral judgments have to have a purpose, something we wish to accomplish. They rarely accomplish anything valuable when working on one’s own development. At best, they might be applicable to actions we’ve taken and now regret. Even then, however, people generally know when they’ve done something wrong. Psychotherapists don’t need to hit them over the head with it. More often, we have to make sure they don’t hit themselves over the head with it, to the extent that it blocks progress.
Occasionally, there is a client who does have to be helped to face the wrongness of some action, but in my experience such clients are a small minority. And even here, it’s not so much a matter of focusing on how wrong the action was—the client already knows that—as focusing on the fact that the client really did perform this action, confronting the full reality of it. With most clients my basic attitude is: “Shall we talk about how rotten you are or shall we look at how you can do better in the future, and create a happier, more satisfying life for yourself?”
Q: All the Objectivist virtues are directly volitional except one, Pride. Each day we can say: “Today I will be honest, productive, rational…” but you cannot say: “Today I will be proud.” Pride is the end result of practicing the other virtues, but it cannot be guaranteed if there has been traumatic damage done to you as a child. Pride is a feeling, an end result of virtuous action. How can a feeling be a virtue? How can the reward of virtuous action be a virtue itself? Should pride be included in the Objectivist list if it cannot be directly volitional?
Branden: What confuses this issue is that there are two different senses in which we use the term “pride.” We can mean pride as an emotional experience and we can mean pride in the Objectivist sense of a virtue. When we speak of pride as an emotional experience we refer to the pleasure we take in our own achievements, in what we have made of ourselves as human beings and what we have accomplished. When we speak of pride as a virtue, we mean moral ambitiousness. We mean a commitment to valuing our own life and striving to become the best person we can, in the moral sense. Here, choice and volition are clearly involved.
Pride as a virtue entails treating yourself as a value, treating yourself with respect, and this may not always be easy, because of one’s fears or insecurities. Courage may be needed. Of course, if one has been doing things about which one feels ashamed or guilty, and refuses to confront these issues and clean them up, pride is as good as impossible. Except that there may still be some spark of pride left that inspires a person to call a halt to his or her self-undermining activity.
Q: If pride is a virtue, and our goal if we are morally ambitious, do we not run the risk of trying to create pride by making our ego the goal of winning an argument, or deciding upon a set of truths that make us look good? Shouldn’t we just seek truth and be honest, productive, etc., and not worry about pride so much? Wouldn’t it be more philosophically correct and psychologically more healthy, if it were not considered a virtue, but just an emotional reward?
Branden: Pride divorced from honesty, reality, and integrity, is not pride. Pride is not about “winning arguments” or “looking good.” I have written about this in The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem. Neither self-esteem or pride are competitive or comparative. It is not about me winning over you or looking better than you. It’s about me being the best person I can be.
Q: You are often described as “the father of the self-esteem movement.” How do you feel about that? Do you think the movement has gone astray? If so, how and why has it happened?
Branden: Being described that way puts me in a difficult position. I don’t want to be ungracious about what is intended as a compliment. And yet, I have many problems with the self-esteem movement. I often agree with the attacks of its critics, although I am also convinced most critics don’t really understand the issues involved.
There are a few serious people in the movement, doing really good work, and I am proud to have them as colleagues. But there is also a lot of fluff, by which I mean shallow, sugar-coated nonsense that has nothing important to do with self-esteem. I’m thinking of the notion that you can grow in self-esteem by greeting yourself in the mirror every morning, blowing yourself a kiss, and saying, “Hi, perfect!” A lot of what is taught in the schools in the name of self-esteem is pretty poor. It gives self-esteem a bad name—like the notion that one should not let a child know how inadequate his or her mastery of some subject is, for fear of undermining self-esteem, as if self-esteem can be achieved by faking reality.
I have been fighting to put the whole subject of self-esteem on an intellectually serious foundation. I am happy that my definition of self-esteem was adopted by the National Council for Self-Esteem, although it is by no means universally accepted by all members. There is still an enormous amount of work to be done. What is certain, however, is that we have to get away from associating self-esteem with schoolchildren singing songs about how wonderful they are. We have to think much more deeply about what self-esteem depends on and how it is nurtured.
Q: The Objectivist ethics treats Reason, Purpose, and Self-esteem as its cardinal values. You have written a great deal about Self-esteem. Have your ever considered turning your attention in future books to Reason and Purpose?
Branden: I have a book coming out in the spring of 1997—The Art of Living Consciously. You can think of that, in a way, as my book about Reason, although I will have more to say about it in another book I am now planning. I don’t put my discussion in the context of Objectivism, just as my writing on self-esteem is not contextualized that way. I write as Nathaniel Branden, not as “an Objectivist.” As for Purpose, I don’t plan to write more than what I wrote in Six Pillars, where living purposefully gets a chapter.
Q: Might it be interesting for you to write a book about how to live rationally? Or on how to choose a productive career?
Branden: Live rationally? That’s The Art of Living Consciously. I’ve no plans to write about choosing a career. I find my interests turning more and more back to philosophy. I’ve done what I wanted to do in psychology.
Q: What advice do you have for anyone wanting to enter the field of psychology, especially clinical psychology?
Branden: Learn as many different ways of working with people as you can. Don’t get stuck on just one or two techniques. Almost every system has something of value in it. Find out what it is. And keep working on yourself. And whether you’re in clinical psychology or some other specialty, don’t think you have nothing to learn from other psychologists just because they are not Objectivists. You have plenty to learn.
Q: Do you consider yourself an Objectivist?
Branden: In terms of broad fundamentals, sure.
Q: What are your chief differences with Rand?
Branden: The biggest area of difference that I am aware of so far is in psychology. Most of the time I disagree with Rand’s psychological explanations of why people believe what they believe or do what they do. For example, I totally dismiss her analysis of the psychology of mysticism, for which, incidentally, she offers no evidence or proof whatever. I agree with her in rejecting mysticism, but that’s a different issue. Also, the psychology of sex is much more complicated than one would ever gather from reading Rand, although I once shared her views. And, in general, her explanations of why people hold the ideas they do are merely assertions, unsupported by argument, as if no other interpretations were possible than the ones that occurred to her. I regard her metaethics as solid, but her ethics itself as underdeveloped and very incomplete. Much more needs to be thought out in the sphere of human relationships. I have some reservations in the field of epistemology but so far they seem small and I am still formulating them. I think her achievements in epistemology are stupendous.
Q: In your talk for IOS this past summer, you spoke of your need to get away from Objectivism, following your break with Rand, in order to gain some perspective. What did you learn by doing so?
Branden: I saw that in the world I had formerly inhabited we were all both meat and meat-grinder—victim and executioner. I saw that Ayn’s literary and philosophical achievements had to be separated from Ayn the person to be adequately appreciated. I saw that she was a tortured and tormented giant. I saw that what I had gained from her, what she had given me, mattered much more to me in the end than any wrong I might attribute to her. And I saw that the pattern of our relationship—younger person and older; student and mentor; Champion and Queen—was not some unique experience I alone was suffering, but a story as old and familiar as history; in a word, an archetype. In the words of the poem, our end was contained in our beginning.
Q: In The Benefits and Hazards of the Philosophy of Ayn Rand, you said that Rand never knew very much about mysticism, and also that mysticism and irrationalism are not synonymous concepts although they are often so treated by Objectivists. Would you clarify?
Branden: By “mysticism” I mean the claim there are aspects of existence that can be known by means of a unique cognitive faculty whose judgments are above the authority of sensory observation or reason. “Irrationalism,” by which I mean the sheer defiance of reason and logic per se, needn’t make any claim to other pathways to knowledge. One can be an irrationalist without being a mystic.
If Ayn had ever seriously studied mystical literature, she would have known how frivolous it was to identify mysticism with “the worship of feelings and whims.” The most brilliant and articulate spokesperson for mysticism to the West is a psychologist named Ken Wilber. It’s impossible to read him without learning that mysticism is a much more complex subject than we ever learned at Objectivist lectures. One doesn’t have to be a mystic to recognize that some of those people have extraordinary minds and sometimes very interesting things to say. I address these matters in The Art of Living Consciously.
Perhaps I should add that I remain an uncompromising champion of reason.
Q: Then the rumors are false that Nathaniel Branden has been flirting with mysticism?
Branden: Yes, they’re false. Also the rumors that I have become a convert to God, altruism, and flying saucers.
Q: Why do you suppose such rumors started?
Branden: Perhaps because of what I’ve just said about Ayn not knowing much about mysticism. Or perhaps because in my lectures and writings I talk about the importance of kindness and benevolence in human relationships. Or perhaps because, in light of how much Branden hurt Ayn Rand, why wouldn’t he believe in flying saucers?
Q: Rand always stressed that emotions are not tools of cognition. Many Objectivists seem to ignore emotions in the name of “being rational.” In contrast, you emphasize the importance of listening to emotions and learning from them. What role do emotions play in the acquisition of knowledge?
Branden: If our goal is self-awareness and self-understanding, they play a supremely important role. Emotions are not, literally, “tools of cognition,” to be sure, but they are often data of great significance. They allow us to directly experience what things mean to us. Without that experience, we are cut off from our own context. Try to decide “rationally” who to ask out for a date, or who to marry, or whether or not to have children, or what career to pursue, without the information provided by your feelings. One of the great insights of my life was the realization that most of the big mistakes I had made had happened while I was ignoring or was oblivious to what I felt.
Q: At the IOS conference, you spoke of the lack of any account of moral redemption in the Objectivist literature. How might such a gap be filled?
Branden: Fortunately, I can give you an example from Atlas. In one of Ayn’s daydreams about the story, she had Stadler redeeming himself at the end by turning against the government at great personal risk—I think he destroys the Project X machine. There is an explosion and when he wakes up he’s in the Valley; Galt and the other strikers have rescued him. That would have been a dramatization of moral redemption. The message would have been: One can fall but then one can rise again. It could have been very inspiring. But I don’t think moral redemption interested her very much. Some other Objectivist will have to write about it.
Q: Why do Objectivists so often appear arrogant? They seem to find it very difficult to say “I don’t know” or “I need to think about that.” Is this where a little humility might be a good thing?
Branden: I’m not fond of the term “humility,” but I sympathize with the intention of the question. What is needed is less pretentiousness and greater realism. Many Objectivists seem to feel that they are special because they share a philosophy superior to all others. It’s as if they base their self-esteem on being a follower of this philosophy, not on anything about their own character or actions. To be comfortable saying “I don’t know,” or “I need to think about that,” one has to have a decent level of self-esteem—and a decent level of honesty. That’s what appears to be missing. What’s involved here is more than lack of “humility.”
Q: You have expressed admiration for Dr. Sciabarra’s book, Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical. What do you see as the chief importance of this book?
Branden: He has brought Ayn Rand into the history of philosophy. He has attempted to place her in a historical context. Whether or not he’s right in all his hypotheses is not the most important point. So far, his is the book most likely to gain the interest of the academic community, and that interest is essential if one is thinking long-range about the spread of Objectivism. You’ve got to get the teaching of Objectivism into the universities.
Q: What do you think of Leonard Peikoff’s Objectivism: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand?
Branden: That book wouldn’t influence anyone who was not already a believer. There is no attempt to build a bridge from other perspectives to Rand’s. Very disappointing. Here is the first major non-fiction work to introduce Objectivism to the world—and it’s stilted, pedantic, totally non-inspirational. No fire and no sense of joy. I had hoped for more from Leonard.
Observe that in the preface he gratuitously insults the academic community, yet he wants that community’s support, or else why would the book be advertised in academic journals? So, like a person with an inferiority complex, he beats the academics to the punch—rejecting them before they can reject him. The book that this one started out to be still needs to be written.
Q: Some thinkers—Doug Den Uyl, Doug Rasmussen, Chris Sciabarra—have argued that Rand’s view of man’s life as the standard of moral value entails more than mere survival but also entails the idea of “flourishing”—something closer to the classic idea of “eudaemonism.” What’s your stand on this?
Branden: You have to realize that when Rand spoke of “survival,” she intended that as synonymous with “the life proper to Man.” She meant a good deal more than merely not dying. She saw “survival” and “flourishing” as inseparable. The example I sometimes gave to make this point clear went like this. Imagine a man in an iron lung. He is not dead but clearly he is not living “the life proper to Man.” Such a life would have to entail the full and proper use of his faculties. I wrote an article on this—I forget whether it appeared in “The Objectivist Newsletter” or “The Objectivist.” So the debates I sometimes hear about between the “survivalists” and the “flourishers” have never made sense to me, not in an Objectivist context.
Q: You have said on more than one occasion that while it may not have been anyone’s intention, there are aspects of Objectivism that encourage repression and emotional self-alienation. At the IOS conference you read passages from Rand’s books to illustrate your thesis. How can a young student protect against this error?
Branden: By always remembering that there is nothing heroic about denying or disowning reality—including the reality of one’s feelings. And—dare I say this?—by studying my books. I have provided a badly needed corrective in this area.
Q: For Objectivism to spread in our culture, what do you see as our most urgent need?
Branden: More than anything, we need books and articles written either about Objectivism or about other subjects from an Objectivist perspective. We need to see more in print about Rand’s philosophy and more about its application to problems in a wide variety of areas. Study groups are fine, conferences are fine, public lectures are fine—but the spread of ideas still depends more on the written word than on anything else. And it’s disappointing how little has been written so far.
Q: Is there any truth to the rumor that you have written several stage plays? If so, do you ever plan to publish them?
Branden: What a pleasure to hear a rumor about me that’s true. Yes, I have written for the theater. No, I don’t plan to publish; not good enough.
Q: Any plans to write a novel?
Branden: I’ve had it in my mind to do so for a long time. Other projects I kept feeling I “must” write kept getting in the way. Right now, I’m working on the outline of what looks to be a fairly big non-fiction book—an integration of philosophy, psychology, culture, history, and political economy—but am I absolutely certain I will write it, or write it next? Not really. I’ve surprised myself too many times in the past.
But what is on my mind, some time in the next few years, is to write a novel. There’s a story idea that’s preoccupied me for a long time. All I can say at the moment is that it feels promising, feels right. I’m reluctant to make forecasts because, you know, it often seems that the books choose me, I don’t choose them—I get this voice in my head saying, (of course I’m speaking poetry here), “I don’t care what your plans were, this is what you must do next.”
All I’m certain of is that as long as I’m alive and functioning, I’ll be writing. Apart from my marriage, working at my computer is the greatest single joy of my life. Sometimes my wife Devers pops in on me when I’m writing, and I look from the computer screen to Devers, and the back to the screen, and then back to Devers, and I don’t know how many times I’ve said to her, “I don’t know what anyone else wants out of life, or thinks life is about, but for me, right here, right now, everything I ever wanted is in the room with me. I feel completely fulfilled. All that’s left to want is that this will go on for a very long time.”
Q: What’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned so far in life?
Branden: I’d like to say, first of all, I hate being confined to the single most important thing. Can I mention two?
Q: Okay, what are the two most important things you’ve learned?
Branden: Let yourself know and fully experience how important love is and honor that importance in your actions. Don’t ever be careless with love. Be aware of the preciousness of each moment of your existence. Be aware that none of us is immortal—the clock is always ticking and none of us knows how long any of us has got. The time to let that other person experience how loved and valued he or she is by us, is right now. It’s one thing to love—and quite another to have the wisdom and courage to live that love fully, unreservedly, and to the hilt. Fully to surrender to love can be terrifying, but it’s the price life asks of us in exchange for the possibility of ecstasy.
Q: And your second message to the world?
Branden: Don’t deny or disown what you see or experience merely because you can’t explain it, justify it, or fit it into some familiar frame-of-reference. Allow a large space in your psyche to accommodate ambiguity and uncertainty. Don’t invent explanations prematurely just so you can tell yourself you have the universe all tied up in one neat package. Keep your eyes open, keep observing, and be confident that sooner or later the truth will appear to you, providing, of course, you live long enough. And if you don’t, well, hasn’t it been an interesting adventure anyway?",0.9739387631416321,9793,1.9717590808868408

Day 1...As always Sydney aka fire breathing sleep monster is a complete and utter joy to wake in the morning. Good luck moms & dads. This sucks.
Day 2...My 615am back to school mornings:Me: Bye Mad Love you
Mad: love you too
Cut to 6:40am
Me: Syd...Syd...Syd... Repeat 50x
Syd: making some unearthly groan/growl
Me: Runs & retrieves cross, wooden stakes & a poptart for leniency. Hides
Day 3...Waking up Sydney for school can only be compared to going after Medusas Head. DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT...
Day 4 of waking Syd Vicious for school...I barely made it out alive. For those of who are thinking I should get her an alarm clock...she smashed the last two. That's my girl... monster
Day 5 of waking Sydney for school:The Kracken has grown weak. It has cramps.
(The village rejoices!)
Day 6 of waking Sydney for school... The Kracken is weakened & betrayed by its body...hollaaaa(take note...every 28 days it will not fight back)
Day 7 of waking Sydney for school...The Kracken is not happy, it yelled at me. We must make a sacrifice....ohhhh Leo where are you? It's hungry
Day 8 of waking Sydney for school:I put my phone in her room(double cased of course) to go off every five minutes with very loud rooster sounds from 630am to 645am. It figured out that after a minute rooster stops. The Kracken is smart. It brought my phone to me with a smirk, kicked a few things and went back to sleep...
Day 9 of waking Sydney for school:It doesn't like rooster sounds. It jumped onto my bed, put the alarm next to my ear, took my blanket & went back to sleep. The Kracken is spiteful.
Random weekend post: I can't wait for the kids to have off Monday and Tuesday. Not because I love them or anything...because Sydneys a beast in the morning and my deflector shields are running low
Random weekend post: The Kracken has fallen ill. I hear sniffling, coughing, & sighing coming from its cave. Must've picked up something in that Petrie Dish ill call Longwood Jr High. Hope it doesn't wander out and infect the ""others"".
No School Monday Post: I tricked the Kracken this morning knowing it was weak and embattled with illness into thinking she had school today. I watched it curl its tail i mean toes under its rock(blanket) to hide from me. I couldn't control my laughter which upset the beast. She threatened to eat my first born. I said go ahead, she still has no job.
Day Ten of waking Sydney for school:I made the Kracken kneel before me as I had many weapons in my hands. Two brushes, leave in conditioner & chapstick. She bowed her head while I tamed the its hair. She left for school and gave me the side eye and a curled lip on her way out. I must lay out a peace offering of Pop Tarts, cereal bars & meat for her return.
Day 11 of waking Sydney for school:I over slept. Sean had to do it. He hasn't been heard from since. Muahahaha.
Day 12 of waking Sydney for school:After Seans disappearance yesterday, I thought I should just let the Kraken sleep in. Our kingdom can not suffer another loss. Plus we are out of Pop Tarts and its all sickly and pale. What good is fighting when its not a fair fight?
Random Weekend day of waking Sydney:Its 11:15am I creep in her room with my video camera & jump on her bed singing Rise and Shine bring glory to your morning. The Kraken is onto me. It hides and yells. The beast is no fun today. Sending her apple picking with grandma for not being a better prank. There is video of this...somewhere
Random weekend day of waking up SydneyI'm not stupid, I yelled from my room that we were going to Dennys...and out she came. Like her mother, all you have to do is lure her with some food
Day 13 of waking up Sydney: I caught her at midnight still awake watching funny videos of people getting hurt on YouTube so i knew her 6am wake up call would be a doozy.630am: I yell from afar to wake up so it sits at the edge of the bed. I hear no grunts, no movement, but its sitting there motionless. Then all of a sudden I watch it fall over face first into a pile of clothes.Morning my sweet Kracken...
Day 14 of waking Sydney for school...Somethings coming. The calm before the storm. She woke up without much incident. Only screamed at me once. The Kraken is plotting its revenge, why else would she smile so early?I'll be foraging supplies for the coming battle.
Day 15 of waking Sydney for school...The Kraken was BORING. She woke right up. Hmm guess she didn't want the bucket of ice, the air horn, the cow prod, the long stick, or me screaming. I may save on pop tarts this week.And the village rejoices once again
Day 16 of waking Sydney for school:The Kraken was relatively boring again. I received A LOT of loud OKAYS when I made her get out of bed 3 times. Nothing was launched and no limbs are missing. I am not optimistic that it will continue to be kind in the coming days ahead. She will falter and I will be waiting...with Pop Tarts
Day 17 of waking Sydney for school:I didn't...I sent in a recruit. MuahahahaShe's missing, but may be found under that pile of crap in her room. I'll check later
Day 18 of waking Sydney for school:Woke her four times before she finally made her way to Monsters Inc. Jr High...Then she puked.
Day 19 of waking Sydney for school:
I peeked in and it was still a little green and there was drool. Probably the poisonous kind that melts skin off.
More lysol is needed",0.9657102823257446,1377,0.5580495595932007

"If I were to describe Mića Popović's work to a passionate rock music fan, I would tell them that he was driven by a creative restlessness and a desire to push boundaries like David Bowie, had a clear and recognizable style like The Rolling Stones, carried rebellion and protest like The Clash, and was banned and contested like Zabranjeno Pušenje (Forbidden Smoking). With all due respect to the aforementioned colleagues, Popović also shared a fascination with Marshall, as well as an interest in marginalized heroes, similar to Zabranjeno Pušenje. The issue of gastarbeiters, or as they were officially known at the time, ""our citizens temporarily working abroad,"" was a concern not only for state security but also for some artists. Among them were Mića Popović and Zabranjeno Pušenje. In this exhibition, you will have the chance to see the figure of the gastarbeiter Gvozden, who, in the brilliant portrayal of Danilo Bata Stojković, appears both silent and motionless, yet alive and loud, emerging from the song ""Dok jezdiš ka Alemanji,"" my favorite rock attraction. At the risk of revealing my own immodesty by placing myself in the same sentence with Mića Popović, I deliberately draw this secret connection, deeply feeling the whirlwinds, tempests, and storms through which Mića had to pass to leave behind such a significant body of work that cannot be measured by ordinary standards. Only great life experience and immeasurable talent can create such significant things. Every work of Mića Popović that I had the opportunity to see, and I have seen many, thanks to the unusual fortune of meeting the Popović family, fulfilled the first and fundamental article of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Art, which states that anyone who writes, paints, or plays has the task of awakening noble feelings in those who listen, read, or look. Thus, Mića Popović, as the greatest rebel, was simultaneously the greatest constitutional defender. If we return to the world of rock music, where I feel most comfortable, I would say that you are presented with rare and little-known singles left behind by this bard. For those who enjoy delving into others' souls, this exhibition will be a true treat. However, as always with great masters, and anyone who knows them well understands this, these singles will reveal the seeds of great and unforgettable albums. Here, before you are drawings, masterpieces in their own right, as well as templates upon which epochal works were later created. This is how the beginning of what was Ziggy Stardust for Bowie, Exile on Main Street for The Stones, London Calling for The Clash, and ""Dok čekaš sabah sa šejtanom"" for Zabranjeno Pušenje looks. If I had to present the quality and significance of these four albums to a passionate art lover, I would simply say, ""That's Mića Popović, my friend!""

Ultimately, the decision to hire someone to complete online classes should be approached with caution and consideration.

"Gareth's Tips, Tools, and Shop Tales - Issue #65
The Antique Art of Cable Lacing
An email exchange after last week's newsletter with maker O.G. Steve Roberts reminded me of the wonders of cable lacing, an old-school method of bundling cables together, using a lacing needle and waxed twine. Here's an ode to cable lacing I wrote on Make: many moons ago as part of the ""Lost Knowledge"" series I did on the website in support of an issue of the magazine with that same theme that I guest edited. The whole series is worth checking out.
The Joys of Bluing
In this Adam Savage tool tips video, he extols the virtues of machinist's layout fluid. Aka ""bluing,"" this blue ink is brushed onto steel stock that you're planning to cut and/or drill and then a scribe is used to mark out your cutting and other layout marks. In the video, he recommends his favorite Starrett scribe and layout fluid.
Lazy Person's Pinstripping
On Hand Tool Rescue, as Eric restores a Victorian food chopper, he reminded me (25:40) of this simple and effective method of painting perfect lines around a circular object. He tapes down a gold marker at the height he wants his line and then rotates the cylinder to paint the line.
TOYS! Spring-Bottom Oiler
This is one of my very first memories of a tool. My granddad had a spring-bottom oiler on his basement workbench. It was one of the first tools that I associated with making. I loved the click-clack sound that it made when you pressed on the bottom. I still do. I have a soft spot for all of the Goldenrod oilers. Even the modern ones feel like old-school tools.
Making Your Own ""Japanning""
Japanning is black tool finish commonly found on hand planes, antique sewing machines, and other older (and some modern) tools. It is a 17th century European interpretation of traditional Japanese black lacquering (dating all the way back to 2000 B.C.). There are many different recipes for making your own Japanning. On Hand Tool Rescue, Eric tested a number of formulae and ended up recommending a mixture of 50% turpentine, 30% asphaltum/gilsonite, and 20% boiled linseed oil. See the video and video description for the full details of the recipe.
Making a WD-40-like Penetrant
Everyone loves to reach for the WD-40 when a penetrating oil is called for. But did you know that you can cheaply and easily make your own? There are dozens of recipes out there (do a YouTube search). Here are two that get high marks from many basement penetrant chemists:
Recipe 1: 4 parts charcoal lighter fluid, 4 parts mineral spirits (or paint thinner), 1 part lightweight motor oil.
Recipe 2: A 50/50 mix of acetone and transmission fluid
The Essential Craftsman Reviews Carolina Boots
If there is a go-to shoe within the maker community, it is likely the Carolina boot. Maybe that's because, as a company, the company is very smart about sending out free boots to YouTubers and other online influencers. (I'm still waiting for mine, Carolina!) In this Essential Craftsman video, Scott breaks down why he's sold on the 8"" Domestic Moc Toe Wedge work boot.
RIP, Sharon of Figments Made
Last week, the maker community lost a light. Sharon from Figments Made passed away peacefully in the night on Tuesday. I never met Sharon in person but I felt like I knew her. She always had a kind word, a helpful suggestion to my Instagram project posts and tweets. She liked and shared EVERY SINGLE ISSUE of this newsletter on social media each week since the week it was launched.
Sharon may have made me feel special, but I was far from alone. She was this supportive and generous of spirit to everyone. When news of her passing began to circulate, everyone shared stories of her generosity, huge heart, and her wicked sense of humor. Sharon genuinely loved the maker community, loved making things herself, and she really enjoyed sharing what she knew with others, especially children.
I only knew Sharon a little, but that little meant a lot. Her impact had weight. May we all be so lucky in our lives.

"Many people rely on the internet for their work, studies, and entertainment. And that trend is more prominent now than ever.
You would browse the internet to find solutions to your problems and more. Have you experienced those hours when Facebook is down and you cannot reload any of the statuses and feed reports? Well, that is normal because apps and programs do need support to upgrade!
But what if you start facing issues with your prime browser for a prolonged period? You should not worry because there are some great solutions provided in this article.
Table of Contents
Are you suddenly not able to find the Wi-Fi option on your laptop? Well, you need to check a few things and try a few hacks before contacting the technician for a big problem. For example, go to settings and check if the Wi-Fi driver is visible or not.
If it is, then just add the shortcut to your desktop again. If it isn’t, then just install the Wi-Fi module again. You must also restart, reboot your device, and try troubleshooting the wi-fi before jumping into these steps directly. If none of these things helps, then your physical driver could be the problem. You will need to call the technician and get it replaced. The worst-case scenario can be that your entire motherboard is at fault.
Unlimited Pop Up Windows
Pop ads and the internet media go hand in hand. You must have noticed a few pop-ups wherein you are asked if the site can send you notifications and other messages.
But, if suddenly you see more pop-ups coming your way on the screen than you can handle, then something indeed is fishy. You cannot always expect multiple sites you did not grant permission to send you ads and links. One of the prime possibilities is the grasp of malware on your device.
The malware has probably embedded itself on your computer via a pop-up ad. You cannot get rid of it just by restarting your laptop and resetting your browser. You need to run an antivirus program to get rid of them.
Opt for a full-time scan, where your entire device is operated. Once done, then just remove the extensions that you do not recognize. Later on, you can install an ad blocker to put an end to all of these random ads permanently.
It is a possibility that your browser may crash if you put unnecessary pressure on your device. You can try out a few troubleshooting steps to check and fix your browser system.
For example, you can clear cache, browsing data, or restore the browser to its standard settings. But, if you are using a beta version of the browser, then do not be surprised! Because the entire idea behind the beta version is to check the updates and receive feedback on the application. The beta version might not work well at times, even with all the latest browser updates. So, you can always keep a browser second in command of your primary browser.
But, some other drives which you might have recently installed can cause an issue as well. Sadly, it’s impossible to pinpoint what different variables may be involved, past uninstalling and reinstalling all your equipment gadgets and programming programs individually and attempting your browser to rerun each time.
When in doubt, stay up with the latest—your gadget drivers, your other programming, and your working framework all in all. This should assist with limiting similarity issues and quit whatever else from meddling with your program.
Unresponsive Social Media Sites
The thumb rule is to restart your device whenever a problem occurs. For example, if your Facebook videos are experiencing a buffer time of 5 seconds or more, then it is time for you to fix it. A lot of times, the sites crash, and the applications close without any prior notice. You cannot always mail the owner of Facebook and Instagram just because your site is unresponsive.
Try clearing your cache data and looking for a new available app update. These reasons highly contribute to the problems that erupt from the sites because all the developers want you to be on the very recent application update. You can try these hacks, and if they don’t help, you might try to reset your application.
The issues with your browser should not find a place to sleep because browsers are super crucial as all the information ends up landing there. If you ever come across an issue listed here, try troubleshooting yourself before calling the technician or customer care.",0.9266747236251831,907,1.5639958381652832

"The Electoral Commission (EC) says it is ready to adopt the Ghana card as the only document to prove citizenship in the next voter registration exercise.
Dr Serebour Quaicoe, Director, Electoral Services at the EC, told the Ghana News Agency in an interview that the Commission had already reached a consensus with the political parties and was waiting for an amendment of the registration laws by Parliament to give legal backing to the move.
He said when the law is amended, persons who did not have the Ghana card would not be able to register to vote because the law would not allow the use of passports or guarantors as a substitute for the Ghana Card.
“We are going to amend the law to incorporate that. What it means is that going forward, anybody who turns 18 and want to register you have to come with evidence of the Ghana card to show that you are a Ghanaian and 18 years then we will register the person. You can’t use your passport or guarantors when the law is amended,” he said.
The EC’s last voter registration exercise was conducted in June 2020, ahead of the general elections.
In that registration exercise, the EC accepted the Ghanaian passport and Ghana card as proof of citizenship. Persons who did not have both documents were made to provide two guarantors who had already registered to get registered.
As of October, this year, the National Identification Authority said it had issued cards to about 12 million Ghanaians.
Dr Quaicoo said the EC was still reviewing the 2020 elections and working closely with the political parties and stakeholders to implement reforms to enhance the country’s electoral management processes.
“Our doors are open for proposals and recommendations, and if it is in accordance with the law, we are going to assess it together, and if possible, we will add it to our reforms,” he said.
Article 51 of the 1992 Constitution grants the EC the power to, by constitutional instrument, make regulations for the adequate performance of its functions, and in particular, for the registration of voters, the conduct of public elections and referenda.
The 2020 voters registration exercise was governed by the Public Elections (Registration of Voters) (Amendment) Regulation, 2020 (C.I. 126), which Parliament passed in June 2020.",0.9760187268257141,469,1.7278259992599487
"SEC Climate Risk Disclosure One Year On
For the climate policy news junkies and carbon geeks that follow greenhouse gas reporting for work or (sadistic?) pleasure, the last few weeks have seen a particularly high churn of new developments. It’s hardly news that the new U.S. Congress isn’t terribly keen on continuing to classify GHGs as pollutants. Likewise, new decisions from the European Commission on the EU Emission Trading Scheme may not please participants and environmental watchdogs alike, but its movements and process are at least well understood.
Looking past these regulatory news spigots, early March has seen a host of stories related to the mundane nuts and bolts of GHG reporting. Specifically: U.S. EPA announced it will delay its mandatory reporting deadline from the end of this month to later this summer; the British government is reportedly set to announce its carbon reporting rules (or justify why it doesn’t need GHG reporting); and the Australian government still has yet to give a clear picture of what we should expect.
A recently released Ceres report (Disclosing Climate Risks & Opportunities in SEC Filings a Guide for Corporate Executives, Attorneys, & Directors) [PDF] looks at this policy volatility through the lens of climate risk disclosure. Financial disclosures of climate risks must necessarily acknowledge our uncertain political environment, including the potential for future regulation as well as a host of other material risks and opportunities presented by climate change. (For more on what all is wrapped up in financial climate risk disclosure see a blog I wrote on the topic last year after the US SEC released its interpretive guidance on climate risk disclosure.)
Given the convergence of factors driving disclosure and the newness of the practice, conventional thinking has suggested that reporting would improve over time. With this in mind, just over a year on from the SEC’s release of interpretive guidance, where do we stand? And more pointedly, what does this mean for GHG measurement, reporting, and verification?
Deferring to Ceres’ expertise on the topic, their conclusion is less than heartening for those who envisioned financial disclosure requirements as a rapid driver of change. In the report’s conclusion, the authors set the tone by ominously reminding their audience of the power of disclosure requirements: “The release of the SEC Guidance on climate disclosure marks an important recognition of that reality, and underlines that disclosure is a matter not only of sound corporate strategy and good investor relations, but, in many cases, a legal obligation.”
Yet the gravity of the force of law is eroded by the authors’ concluding remarks on the realities of current practice: “Although public companies’ climate reporting has improved somewhat in recent years, it remains true that disclosures very often fail to satisfy investors’ legitimate expectations.”
How to measure this apparent mixed bag? The report presents examples of corporate disclosures in an attempt to sketch out a best practice vision. But while these case studies are helpful, from a GHG reporting angle, the authors’ 11-point checklist offers perhaps the most insightful perspective on the state of the art. On the one hand, this section offers frustratingly little reference to GHG verification (in fact the entire report contains only a single explicit reference to auditing/verifying GHG data); on the other hand, systems, governance, and data quality are generally broached:
Systems, processes and controls to gather reliable information on firm emissions, physical risks, enacted and proposed regulations, and climate-related initiatives will determine the quality of management analysis, decision-making and disclosure to investors. For many companies, these systems are essential, because the process of gathering emissions data poses complex questions related to setting organizational and operations boundaries, tracking emissions over time, managing inventory quality and other issues.
Yes, discussion in this paper remains relatively high level on these issues, but if this report can be viewed as broadly capturing the state of discourse on climate risk disclosure, it would seem to suggest a shift to considering some the realities of the institutional capacity questions related to implementation (a subject we at the Institute view as a critical — and often overlooked — priority).
In spite of progress on this front, the report also contains hints that seem to suggest a diverse field amongst corporates analyzing climate risk. With some still on the sidelines, requiring cajoling to begin even basic reporting.
Whether or not greenhouse gas emissions are material and subject to mandatory disclosure under the securities laws will depend upon the magnitude of a company’s emissions weighed against the content of existing or proposed regulations. But a firm cannot identify the potential impact of regulations without knowing what its emissions are. As the SEC Guidance explains, management “should ensure that it has sufficient information regarding the registrant’s greenhouse gas emissions and other operational matters to evaluate the likelihood of a material effect arising” from enacted or proposed legislation or regulations.
With these observations noted, what can we conclude about climate risk disclosure one year on from the SEC’s interpretive guidance release? Perhaps the authors left it best at marginal improvement that fails to satisfy legitimate expectations.",0.9458252191543579,1048,1.620863437652588

"Aer (/ɛə/ from Latin: aer, meaning air) is a lightweight, OpenSource, general-purpose, object-oriented scripting programming
language suited also for web development as well as embedded environments. It implements a highly-efficient bytecode compiler
and a virtual machine. The term Aer is used interchangeably with AerScript. Its syntax draws upon C++, C#, Java and PHP.
Aer is the ideal language interpreter for writing enhanced web applications like blog, CMS, search engine, etc. or
embedded solutions with dynamic web interfaces like routers, set-top-boxes, or smart home solutions. Aer Interpreter
is based on PH7 Engine and thus it is 100% hand-coded, written in pure C software, that compiles unmodified and runs
on any platform including restricted embedded device with a C compiler.
The core syntax of Aer language is similar to that of other C-style languages such as C++, C#, Java or PHP. In particular:
- Semicolons are used to denote the end of a statement.
- Curly brackets are used to group statements. Statements are commonly grouped into methods (functions), methods into
classes, and classes into namespaces.
- Variables are assigned using an equals sign, but compared using two consecutive equals signs.
- Square brackets are used with arrays, both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them.
Full Aer Specification can be found on the Wiki Pages.
AerScript - Modern PHP
Despite, that Aer syntax draws among others upon PHP, it is not fully compatible with it. Aer is a modern, pure Object-Oriented
Language. The distinctive features and powerful extensions to the PHP programming language are:
- Strict, full OOP,
- Method overloading,
- Strict, full type hinting,
- Introducing comma expressions,
- Improved operator precedences,
- 64-bit integer arithmetic for all platforms,
- Smart exception mechanism,
- Native UTF-8 support,
- Built-in standard library and extensions support,
- Garbage Collected via Advanced Reference Counting,
- Correct and consistent implementation of the ternary operator,
- Consistent Boolean evaluation,
- Introducing the $_HEADER superglobal array which holds all HTTP MIME headers.
64-Bit Integer Arithmetic For All Platforms
Unless most scripting and programming languages, Aer have standardized the size of an integer and is always stored in 8 bytes
regardless of the host environment. Because there is no cross-platform way to specify 64-bit integer types Aer includes typedefs
for 64-bit signed integers. Thanks to that, integers can store values between -9223372036854775808 and +9223372036854775807
inclusive, both on 32-bit and on 64-bit host OS.
Native UTF-8 Support
Aer has builtin native support for UTF-8 characters. That is, you are not restricted to use only plain-English to name variables
or methods. Any UTF-8 encoded natural language can be used without the need for ICU or any other internationalization package.
The reason why performance rocks under AerScript and its PH7 Engine relies in the fact that is a hand-coded project. That is,
Aer does not use any external tools to generate it's lexical analyzer such as lex or flex, nor does not use LALR(1) parsers such
as Bison or YACC to generate it's parser. By acting so, the lexer and the parser are thread-safe, full re-entrant, generate
better error message, takes less space in the source tree and are easier to maintain.
Aer is written in C. It compiles and runs unmodified on any platform including restricted embedded device with a C compiler.
The PH7 Engine have been extensively tested under Windows and UNIX including Linux and FreeBSD. If you have successfully compiled
and tested Aer in an exotic environment or a proprietary UNIX, please let us know.
Aer is a multi-platform software, that can be built on any Operating System. On Unix-like. macOS and Cygwin it is as
easy as to fetch the source code and issue single command:
Above command will build a Aer interpreter with all its SAPI and modules with debug information or basic release optimization,
depending on the chosen option. All object files produced by compiler and binaries, produced by linker will appear in ./build/
On Windows, it is required to install MingW32 or MingW64 to build the Aer Interpreter using Makefile. However, it is also possible
to use other C compiler, especially MSVC.
While doing our best, we know there are still a lot of obscure bugs in AerScript. To help us make Aer the stable and solid
product we want it to be, we need bug reports and bug fixes. If you can't fix a bug yourself and submit a fix for it, try
to report an as detailed report. When reporting a bug, you should include all information that will help us understand what's
wrong, what you expected to happen and how to repeat the bad behavior. You therefore need to tell us:
- your operating system's name and version
- what version of Aer Interpreter you're using
- anything and everything else you think matters.
Tell us what you expected to happen, what did happen and how you could make it work another way. Dig around, try out and test.
Then, please include all the tiny bits and pieces in your report. You will benefit from this, as it will enable us to help you
quicker and more accurately.

"After months and months of planning your perfect day, you are going to want to make sure every magical moment is captured on film. Elegant and creative bridal photography will be the most essential way to remember the highlights of the best day of your life.
With all of the decisions that go into wedding planning, choosing a wedding photographer can seem like a lot of stress. Do not stress out too much because there are a few simple things you can look for to ensure your day in forever remembered. Your wedding photographs will be cherished for generations to come.
Before the end of the 19th century, couples did not pose for formal wedding photos. They may have posed for a formal photo in their best clothes before or after a wedding instead. However, in the late 1860s, more people started having their picture taken in their wedding clothes, and even sometimes hired a photographer to come to the wedding location. Today there are thousands of bridal photography choices out there to capture every moment of your wedding.
When you begin researching photography wedding packages, you will want to make sure a few aspects come standard. Most photographers will offer to shoot your entire day all the way through the reception. If the wedding photographer prices only include set hours, you may want to look elsewhere. Those candid shots can be just as important as the formal wedding photography poses.
In 1861, the first color photograph was taken by the British physicist, James Maxwell. Starting in the 20th century, color photography was emerging, but the technique was still unreliable and expensive, so most wedding photography was still done in black and white. Now your photographs can be taken in an array of colors and styles, and you will want to communicate which ones you prefer to your bridal photography team.
The more modern approach to recording the entire wedding started evolving in the 1970s. The feel included a more documentary style of photography. Creative wedding photographers will compile a great number of pictures to tell a story about this fairy tale day.
If you are worried about staying within your wedding budget, while still getting the best wedding pictures, all you need is a little research. There are plenty of affordable wedding photographers out that will meet all of your bridal photography needs. Make sure you compare not only prices, but what the packages include. Often times you will get proof or prints of your pictures for free, so be sure to ask what is offered.
You can even find great deals on an international wedding photographer or a destination wedding photographer. However, make sure a solid contract is signed with clear expectations of the costs. You may be required to pay for their transportation. Remember to do a lot of research and compare prices before locking in any bridal photography options. On the opposite side of the coin, remember to start this research almost a year in advance because the best photographers book up quickly.

"By claiming innocent spouse relief, you can be relieved of liability for taxes, interest and penalties if your spouse (or ex-spouse) improperly reported items or omitted items on your tax return.
Generally, only your spouse (or ex-spouse) can recover the tax, interest, and penalties that qualify for the exemption. However, you are jointly and severally liable for any taxes, interest and penalties that are not covered by the exemption.
What Is Innocent Spouse Relief?
This applies to situations where one spouse has not received the income from which the liability arises and after the divorce, even if the spouse agreed to be responsible for paying the tax during the divorce settlement.
However, the IRS has provided defence options through the innocent spouse provision of the Internal Revenue Code.
This is especially important in situations where only one spouse is a viable source of collection. It can also be a situation where adverse collection actions threaten the former spouse’s acceptable standard of living.
In order to file an innocent spouse claim, taxpayers must file Form 8857. This requires detailed answers to a series of questions about the spousal relationship and liability at issue.
How Does Innocent Spouse Relief Work?
There are situations where the fraud was done knowingly and the wife who was kept in the dark is forced to try to explain to the authorities when they really have no idea what just happened.
It can be a very painful and humiliating experience to know that your spouse has cheated on you and you are expected to clean up. This may also mean that you will be on the hook for their obligations.
Fortunately, the IRS has a provision known as innocent spouse relief. If you meet certain criteria, you will be exempt from any atrocities committed by your husband.
It’s a great relief to know that at least some of the destruction will be lifted off your shoulders. We have helped other bereaved spouses and we can help you.

Innocent Spouse Relief Example
In the event of a divorce (or death), both spouses remain responsible for paying taxes for that year, even if (in the event of a divorce) the decree states otherwise. Some lawyers do not understand that family court decisions do not supersede the IRS tax code.
You can claim innocent spouse relief from tax liability, including applicable penalties and interest, if you believe your ex-spouse has put you in an unfair position and should be responsible for all or most of the money owed.
The first step you need to take is to carefully complete and submit Form 8857. The IRS will use it to determine whether one of the three types of innocent spousal relief is warranted in your circumstances. If more information is needed, the IRS will contact you.
How Does Innocent Spouse Relief Tax Work?
Because of certain advantages of filing jointly, many married taxpayers choose to file jointly. However, filing a joint return carries an additional burden as both parties are responsible for paying the tax.
Also, under the IRS code, married taxpayers filing jointly are responsible for any additional tax, penalties or interest associated with the account.
This is a concept in law known as joint and several liability, meaning that the spouses are liable for any tax liabilities together (jointly) but may be liable for them as individuals (separately).
How Does Innocent Spouse Relief IRS Work?
As a practical matter, the IRS does not have the resources to independently determine who is an innocent spouse.
This would require the IRS to review thousands and thousands of joint collection accounts. They will make individual decisions about who should be assessed the increased liability.
The IRS will calculate the amount of tax you paid after you file Form 8857. You do not have to determine this amount. But if you wish, you can figure it out yourself. See Post 971 for how to apportion underpayment tax.

What Are The Types Of Innocent Spouse Relief?
Original Spouse Relief
Original spousal relief is the first and most basic form of relief. In order to qualify, you must file a joint tax return with your spouse on which your spouse made serious mistakes or committed fraud.
You should not have known about the fraud and you should be able to prove that you did not know and could not have known.
If you are not eligible for either of the other two forms of innocent spousal relief, the IRS will review your eligibility for injunctive relief. This is the only type of relief for the innocent spouse that allows you to get relief from underpayment or underpayment of tax.
You may be eligible for legal protection in situations where you have been the victim of abuse. This includes where you were unaware of your spouse’s fraudulent activities. It also include where circumstances have deprived you of your ability to pay tax.
Separate Liability Election
This type of settlement divides the amount owed between you and your ex-spouse. To qualify, you must file a joint tax return with a spouse to whom you are no longer married or from whom you are separated.
Additionally, you may qualify for the separate liability election if you were not a member of the same family when you filed your joint tax return.
How To Qualify For Innocent Spouse Relief
Each program has different qualifications to receive aid. If you are entitled to relief, your name will remove all or part of the joint and several liabilities.
If your liability is discharged in full, you will no longer be liable or responsible for the unpaid tax liability. It is important to note that helping the innocent spouse is not the same as helping the victimized spouse.
You may be eligible for relief under the spousal survivor provisions if you filed a joint tax return and all or part of your overpayment was applied or offset against backlogged federal tax, state income tax, child support, or spousal support or federal nontaxable debt, such as a student loan.
To be eligible for Innocent Spouse Relief, you must meet all of the conditions below. First, you must file a joint return with an understatement of the tax shortfall. This flaw can be directly applied to your husband’s mistake.
This includes income your spouse earned but didn’t report, as well as improperly reported deductions, credits, and capital gains. Next, you must be able to prove that when you signed the tax returns, you were unaware of the errors and had no reason to know about them.
Finally, to qualify, you must prove that, based on your circumstances and all the facts involved, it would be unfair to hold you liable.
How To Apply For Innocent Spouse Relief
If you think you may qualify for innocent spouse relief, you can apply by filing Form 8857 with the IRS. You don’t need to pay a fee to apply for help, but you may need to pay a professional to help you complete the form.
If you want to claim innocent spouse relief, you must file Form 8857. You must do this within two years of the date the IRS first started trying to collect tax from you. For example, if the IRS sent you a notice of deficiency on September 1, 2018, you would have to file Form 8857 by August 31, 2020.
If you’re requesting exemption from liability for interest and penalties, you must file Form 8857 within 10 years of the date the IRS first began trying to collect tax.
After you file Form 8857, the IRS will review your request and make a decision. If he approves your request, you will no longer be responsible for the applicable taxes. If the IRS denies your request, you can appeal the decision.
The Innocent Spouse Relief is for people who file a joint tax return (married people filing a joint tax return). If there is no income on your tax return, it should be your spouse’s income, not yours. Be able to show that when you signed the tax return, you did not know and had no reason to know that you were underestimating your tax liability.
The IRS looks at everything from the nature of the mistake to your financial situation and your education. They study how involved you were in the activity that created the problem, whether the problem is part of a pattern, and other factors.
The IRS also considers fairness when determining whether to award relief to the innocent spouse. It looks at everything from whether you benefited from a tax mistake, to your marital status and even whether your spouse left you.
Innocent Spouse Relief FAQs
Will Your Spouse Be Contacted When You File For Innocent Spouse Relief?
In every case of innocent spouse relief, the IRS must contact your spouse about your claim, even if you were a victim of spousal or domestic violence. The law provides that both spouses participate in the process
How Do You Know You Are Eligible For Innocent Spouse Relief?
A married couple filing a joint tax return must be filed, and they must not have actual knowledge or reason to know of the understatement of income or overstatement of deductions. In addition, they could not benefit from the tax savings. Generally, this is the case where the spouses are either currently separated or living separately. But the tax return in question must have been filed as a married joint return at the time of filing for Innocent Spouse Relief.
What Is The Implication Of Filing Joint Income Tax Returns?
Most couples file joint income tax returns. Filing jointly means that both spouses are responsible for any taxes, interest and penalties. This includes those resulting from errors or willful failure to comply with tax requirements. If the IRS determines within three years that the taxes were filed incorrectly, the IRS can pursue both spouses in an attempt to collect the debt.",0.967663049697876,2018,1.1643329858779907
"The Go Playground
About the Playground
If the program contains tests or examples and no main function, the service runs the tests. Benchmarks will likely not be supported since the program runs in a sandboxed environment with limited resources.
There are limitations to the programs that can be run in the playground:
- The playground can use most of the standard library, with some exceptions. The only communication a playground program has to the outside world is by writing to standard output and standard error.
- In the playground the time begins at 2009-11-10 23:00:00 UTC (determining the significance of this date is an exercise for the reader). This makes it easier to cache programs by giving them deterministic output.
- There are also limits on execution time and on CPU and memory usage.

"We’ve all been there: The round is going well, you’re chugging along. Maybe you’ve mis-hit a shot or two, or botched a few putts, but overall, things are okay. Then, it happens: the big blow-up. The hole or series of shots where everything goes wrong, derailing your entire round.
Experiencing this kind of disappointment can be demoralizing regardless of when in the round it occurs. But part of becoming a better player is learning how to recognize potential round-killers and overcoming them before they affect you, protecting both your score and your sanity.
While specific round-killers can vary by player, there are a few that are universally afflicting. According to GOLF Teacher to Watch Jonathan Buchanan, playing the hero is one major round-killer that recreational players would be wise to avoid.
“When most amateurs get in trouble, they stay in trouble,” Buchanan said. “Meaning they often try to do too much instead of using their next shot to ensure they get back into a playable position in the fairway. That’s where you find a lot of triples and big numbers.”
The other problem, Buchanan said, is that many recreational players tend to hold themselves to irrationally high standards, expecting to duplicate the best shot of their life at a given moment.
“Many players will be faced with a shot, say 200, 220 yards over water, and they think that the one 5-wood they’ve hit in their life that goes that far should be that shot,” he said. “Instead, I recommend breaking that shot down by half.

"‘He should be penalized’: Brandel Chamblee disputes controversial ruling

At Bay Hill’s final hole, Wyndham Clark sparked a debate no player wants to be at the center of.
Did his ball move or not?
One of golf’s most respected — and loudest — voices, thinks it did.
“I don’t need video to see this. I saw it live and I knew the ball moved,” said Brandel Chamblee on Saturday night’s Golf Central. “I think he should have been penalized.”
To recap, Clark was tied for the lead at nine under near the end of the third round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational when blew his tee shot way right on the 18th hole. The last at Bay Hill doesn’t have as much room right as Los Angeles Country Club’s final hole, so Clark found himself in the deep rough just short of the devious pond that guards the right side of the vaunted hole.
Hitting a shot from the thick rough over the pond to the 18th green at Bay Hill is one of the most difficult shots on the PGA Tour, despite Clark having just 143 yards in. As he and caddie John Ellis decided how they were going to play to the front left pin, Clark tried to address the ball with a wedge.
That’s when PGA Tour Lead TV rules and Video Analyst Mark Dusbabek said his heart “fluttered.”
NBC cameras cut to a tight shot of Clark’s clubhead behind the ball and it appears, as Clark was trying to determine what club he could get on the lie, the ball seems to sink slightly deeper into the grass.
Clark hacked out to safety just short and left of the green, but NBC play-by-play man Dan Hicks was clearly disturbed by the close-up angle of Clark putting his wedge behind the ball.
“I gotta say, we were all looking at that when he put that club behind that ball and kind of went down like that,” Hicks said.
That’s when Hicks brought in Dusbabek to ask if there had been any violation of the rules.
“For a ball to move, based on the definition, it has to go to a different spot,” Dusbabek said. “It can move, but as long as it comes back to its original spot, it technically hasn’t moved. So, when we watch this tape, it looks like it’s come back to its same spot.”
Before being interrupted by a commercial break, Hicks questions if there was any chance Clark was trying to improve his lie. They picked the conversation back up when coverage resumed.
“I know, Dan, that it looks bad, that maybe he’s trying to improve the area of his intended swing,” Dusbabek said. “It doesn’t look like there’s enough there. It’s just hard to say. A player is allowed to ground his club with the weight of the club against the ground. So, that’s basically what he’s doing right there.
“I feel his ball didn’t move, and I feel like he did nothing to affect the stroke.”
Dusbabek was referencing rule 8.1b (4) which states that players are allowed to, “ground the club lightly right in front of or right behind the ball,” with “ground the club lightly” meaning, “allowing the weight of the club to be supported by the grass, soil, sand or other material on or above the ground surface.”
But analyst Brad Faxon challenged that Clark was only using the weight of the club.
“There was definitely pressure pushing down there,” Faxon said. “It certainly wasn’t good-looking.”
Fellow analyst Luke Donald added that Clark needed to use more caution to avoid the potential for an infraction. He also said it couldn’t have benefited him much since he was just laying up.
Ultimately, Clark couldn’t get up and down for par and he’ll go into the final round at eight under, one back of Scottie Scheffler and Shane Lowry.
But he was shown the video of him addressing his second shot when he got into scoring.
“I had no idea that even happened,” Clark told Eurosport’s Espen Blaker. “I wasn’t trying to do anything like cheating or anything like that or improve my lie. I just simply put my club down. And you know obviously, they zoom in, it makes it look worse. We all talked about it, [his playing partner] Scottie and the rules officials, they didn’t think it moved.”
Golf Central’s Todd Lewis reported that the video of Clark addressing the ball was sent to all members of the PGA Tour rules committee on-site at Bay Hill. Lewis also reported that PGA Tour Chief Referee Ken Tackett said the committee unanimously agreed that the ball wobbled and returned to its original spot, based on Clark’s testimony and the video.
The “Naked Eye” standard, also comes into effect here. The “Naked Eye” standard was adopted into the Rules of Golf in 2017 to prevent players from being penalized for things only high-definition or slow-motion cameras could discover.
Rule 20.2c states, “If the facts shown on the video could not reasonably have been seen with the naked eye, that video evidence will be disregarded even if it indicates a breach of the rules.”
However, that wasn’t enough to convince Chamblee.
“I would respectfully disagree with the rules officials. I would respectfully disagree with Wyndham Clark. The ball clearly moved. He clearly didn’t ground the club lightly,” Chamblee said. “Why he was putting his club into the ground so forcefully is beyond me.”
Chamblee then replays the video of Clark addressing the video with a red circle drawn around the ball and watches as the ball’s position within the circle changes as he pushes the club into the ground.
“You could see it without the circle,” Chamblee said. “I think he should have been penalized and you begin to wonder what a Tour player has to do to get a penalty. Over the last year, year-and-a-half, two years, I have some violations that go unpenalized, numerous times!
“No longer is it a penalty to tap down spike marks. You can ground a club in the penalty area. You can inadvertently touch the sand. Your ball can move when you address it. It’s almost impossible to get a penalty these days. But when a rules violation, at least to me that is as obvious as this — and I don’t need video to see it — you would think that a penalty would be assessed.”

"A controversial “pro-majority” group gathers today in Jena, La., to protest both the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday and last September’s rally that brought thousands of African-Americans to the small town in solidarity with six arrested black teens now famous as the Jena Six.
A group of black and white Jena residents, including three parents of the Jena Six, is sponsoring a counter protest to drown out the white-supremacist voice with a message that says, “No to nooses.”
Monday’s “Jena Justice Day” is sponsored by the Nationalist Movement, a Mississippi-based organization with a history of MLK Day protests. Organizers first said marchers would be armed, because they believed the town’s policy banning firearms in parades violated their Second Amendment rights. They later said supporters would not bring guns as long as it was clear it was by choice.
The group also sued the town after refusing to post a $10,000 bond or liability insurance. The Nationalist Movement argued it burdened their constitutional right to free speech. After two status conferences with a federal judge, Jena’s mayor acknowledged the ordinance did not pass First Amendment muster.
Announced speakers at the anti-MLK rally include James L. Hart, who ran for Congress in west Tennessee in 2004 as a Republican campaigning door-to-door with the slogan, “Whites Have Rights.”
Now running as a write-in candidate for the Tennessee Legislature, Hart has called for stopping all immigration from Mexico and promised if elected to the U.S. House of Representatives he would ask the FBI to investigate whether the “Mexican invasion of California and Texas” is an act of war. If so he pledged to ask Congress to declare war on Mexico.
Hart advocates “eugenics,” a theory that intermarriage between “favored” and “less favored” races puts America at risk by lowering average IQs.
Hart told the Shreveport Times he planned to talk about how the Jena Six case was distorted by the media.
“The media would have us believe the Jena Six are like Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,” he said. “But, in reality, they are like O.J. (Simpson). They’re just typical black criminals who have been allowed to go free by a corrupt court system.”
Also featured is Larry Darby, who two years ago drew 44 percent of the vote as runner up in the Democratic primary for Alabama’s Attorney General.
A practicing attorney from Montgomery, Darby created controversy during his campaign by claiming there is no evidence of a mass extermination Jews during World War II. Estimating no more than 140,000 Jews died in Europe during the war, and most of them from typhus, Darby described the commonly cited figure of 6 million Jewish deaths part of a “Holocaust industry.”
Darby was founder of the Atheist Law Center but now says he no longer categorically denies the existence of God. He calls himself a “Christian in a sense that Jesus of Nazareth would approve.”
The January 21st Committee, the group formed to oppose the Nationalist parade, called on people to come to Jena to “politically drown out” their message by bringing whistles, noisemakers, instruments and bells.
“White supremacists plan to march in Jena on Martin Luther King Day in 2008,” the committee said in a written call to action. “On Martin Luther King Day of all days, the one day that is supposed to be about the struggle of black people, they are coming to march with nooses. This is a call to people everywhere, on Monday, Jan. 21, get to Jena.”
Jena officials asked both the Nationalists and their opponents to stay away from today’s planned rallies.
“To anyone who is considering coming to Jena on Jan. 21 either to support the Nationalist Movement rally or to oppose it, we say, ‘Please don’t,'” said a statement released by LaSalle Parish Sheriff Carl Smith, Sheriff-elect Scott Franklin, Mayor Murphy McMillin, Jena Police Chief Paul Smith and LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters.
“The healing process is under way here,” the statement said. “Causing more strife only hurts us all.”
The Nationalist “Jena Justice Day” protests an incident in December 2006 at Jena High School. Six black teens allegedly beat a white student after a series of racially charged incidents that included white students hanging nooses from a tree at the school.
No white students were charged, but the black students were initially charged with attempted murder. Those charges were later reduced.
An estimated 20,000 people marched in Jena Sept. 20, protesting perceived inequities in America’s justice system against African-Americans.
Backlash to that event included numerous copycat hangings of nooses, prompting some to conclude nooses have replaced white hoods and burning crosses as symbols of racial hate.
“Racism remains a deep flaw in the American character,” said Robert Parham of the Baptist Center for Ethics. “Groups such as the Nationalist Movement are raw reminders of racial extremism, but less overt expressions and covert forms of racism are just as morally wrong and they worm their ways into almost every facet of our social life.”
“The rate of incarceration of African-American males, payday lending, predatory bankers with sub-prime mortgages, anti-public school ideologies, anti-immigration rhetoric and anti-taxation attitudes often have the seed of racism in them,” Parham said. “Yet too many of us deceive ourselves about our own racism when we see the obvious racism of the Nationalist Movement.”

"Framed posters add great value to the walls of the house. Whether they are large or small they enhance the overall interior of the room. Small posters need a collage composition on the wall but a single large poster is enough for the entire wall. Indoor wall posters are usually framed and either it is a classic style or a thin modern style they protect the painting and prevent it from getting old. These days indoor wall posters are made with a plastic frame along with a plastic acrylic transparent sheet to make them lighter and easy to carry. Before that, we used to have framed posters with glass and they were quite heavy. If they accidentally fall or do not handle properly while delivery then glass can break and it may damage the painting. Due to this main reason plastic frames and transparent sheets are used.

Students take active role to create real-life solutions for real-life problems at Zero Waste Challenge
An app to help you sort your waste. Dishes for dine-in at the food court. A website to repurpose lab materials. These are just some of bold ideas proposed by students in the Zero Waste Challenge that you might notice soon on campus.
During Canadian Innovation Week May 14 to 16, 75 undergrads, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars from 10 faculties gathered virtually to help solve a problem at the University of Calgary: how to reach the ambitious goal of becoming a zero-waste campus by 2030.
Led by the Hunter Hub for Entrepreneurial Thinking, in partnership with the Office of Sustainability, Facilities Management, and the Sustainable Energy Development program, the Zero Waste Challenge had students working in 27 teams to generate solutions that will help meet the objectives of the forthcoming Zero Waste Strategy. Teams were asked to develop an impactful and feasible project idea, define the steps for its execution, and present their solution to a panel of judges.
Sustainability is a multi-disciplinary challenge,” says Irene Herremans, professor, Sustainable Energy Development Program, School of Public Policy. “The Zero Waste Challenge participants formed teams from different degrees — undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc — and from a wide variety of disciplines.
One of the strengths of the event was that students from very diverse backgrounds came together to provide innovative solutions for waste minimization and elimination. Different points of view for how to tackle a challenge can be extremely valuable.
""The entire organizational team was very proud of the participants and the creative ideas that they presented.”
The challenge was the first event in the Hunter Hub Solutions Labs series, where participants use entrepreneurial thinking and collaboration to tackle interdisciplinary problems. This event in particular provided students with the opportunity to play an active role in creating impactful solutions for a real-world problem.
“We designed the Hunter Hub Solutions Labs as a new series that will capture the growing interest and passion students have for solving key societal issues and reaching key sustainable development goals,” says Keri Damen, executive director of the Hunter Hub for Entrepreneurial Thinking. “It allows them to build interdisciplinary skills as changemakers, no matter what career path they take.”
Over the weekend, students heard from a wide variety of experts in waste-related issues, including a keynote presentation by Melissa Gorrie, president and co-founder of Waste Free Edmonton, on stopping waste at the source. Students were able to ask questions directly to the presenters and incorporate their advice into their projects.
At the end of the challenge, each team was required to submit a five-minute video and a one-page brief that outlined their proposal. A panel of judges representing the University of Calgary, The City of Calgary, the Recycling Council of Alberta, Innovate Calgary, Bow Valley College, and Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Ltd. then scored the teams based on their presentation skills and their proposal’s rationale, feasibility, and potential of making an impact.
From a total of 17 final proposals, the judges decided to divide the $3,600 prize pool among the top four teams:
- Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle Through Research: A proposal to create an easy-to-use web platform and a skills lab that will connect stakeholders across the university, including faculties and students, allowing for reduction, repurposing, and recycling of lab materials.
- An education resource app for mobile devices, which informs users about what existing sustainable resources are available to them on campus, such as the location of waste bins and an easy guide to waste sorting.
- A Waste-Free World in Our Cafeteria: Solutions to reduce the amount of waste produced in the MacEwan Student Centre, including condiment dispensers, vendor-supplied reusable dishes for dine-in, and incentives for customers to bring their own reusable containers, such as monthly draws for gift cards.
- A proposal for UCalgary to minimize the amount of paper used in course examinations via a shift to an online format — computer lab technology, laptop/tablet library lending program, or 24-hour exams — and support for instructors in the development of alternative assessment methods (such as experiential learning, group projects, presentations, and oral exams).
“It was inspiring to see how the students applied their skills, knowledge, and passion to generate new ideas that can enable our campus to realize the Zero Waste Strategy,” says Rachelle Haddock, manager, sustainability partnerships and engagement. “By engaging in this co-curricular experiential learning opportunity, students were developing their sustainability leadership competencies through engaging with subject matter experts and peer-to-peer learning, and I think they had fun while doing it.”
Students who are interested in taking their ideas further are encouraged to apply to the Hunter Hub’s Launchpad program, which provides the training and resources they need to transform their ideas into action. The team at Facilities Management will be next to review all submissions and assess how these ideas can contribute to the shared goal of a zero-waste campus by 2030.
“Facilities Management, and Caretaking in particular, wish to thank the Hunter Hub, the Office of Sustainability, the Sustainable Energy Development Program, and Ancillary Services for the successful partnership in hosting the Zero Waste Challenge,” says Ana Pazmino, co-ordinator, recycling and solid waste, Facilities Management. “A very special thanks to all the judges, presenters, and mentors for their time, support, and dedication, and to our sponsor Coca-Cola. We value the enthusiasm, participation, creativity, and contributions of students in such an important strategy for the university.”

"One of the first questions you’ll get when you call professional movers is whether you are making a local or long-distance move. While it’s obvious there are differences between the moves, it might be hard to understand the intricacies from a customer standpoint. Knowing what kind of move you’re going to need will help you save time, effort, and money in the long run. So what are the differences?
Local vs. Long Distance Move
It might be obvious that a move down the street would be considered a local move, but what if you’re moving 5+ hours away in the same state? Generally, a local move is defined as moving either within the same city or within a 50-70 mile radius of your current home.
On the flip-side, a long distance move is one that is more than 70 miles away and generally requires crossing state lines. Long distance moves require careful planning to ensure that the delivery arrives at the right place at the right time. Long distance moves might be calculated in days versus hours depending on how far you’re going. More importantly, crossing state lines means the movers will need additional insurance and licenses to cover different locations and policies.
So what happens if you’re moving 50-70 miles away but it’s in a different state? Well that depends on the movers and your location. For example, many NYC moving companies consider bordering cities in New Jersey and Connecticut to be a local move. Don’t assume that’s the case with all movers, though. You should always give your new address and ask questions!
Price Calculation Local vs. Long Distance
Understanding quotes and estimates from local movers should be straightforward so long as you are working with a reputable company. When talking to the company, give as much information as possible. The more detailed you are, the more accurate the quote will be. The most obvious information is how big your house is, your current address, and your new address. However, don’t forget to note:
- If the movers will need to go up/down stairs at either of your houses
- What extra services you’ll need (packing, storage, unpacking, packing materials)
- Whether you’re moving any bulky items like pianos, pool tables, etc.
Based on the information you give them, they will calculate how many hours it will take them to move, how many movers you’ll need, and any extra services you add on. You can usually get away with having an extra box or two on moving day as that won’t increase the total amount of hours it takes for your move. Just don’t expect to not get charged extra if you end up with 10 extra boxes!
Long distance moves are calculated differently. There are several factors they take into account to determine the total cost including:
- How much you’re moving
- The distance between the origin and destination
- The total weight of items
Moving companies are required by law to charge by the pound. They must also follow the interstate tariff set by the United States Department of Transportation and might provide discounts. Long distance movers will set their charges in one of two ways:
- Binding estimate – the movers will estimate the weight before providing the price
- Weight – you get a price per pound and the moving company will weigh everything after
When you’re deciding which movers to use, try to find one that provides a binding estimate. As the name suggests, whatever price the movers give you will become a fixed cost. If you agree to the estimate, you will pay that price, nothing higher and nothing lower. Make sure to obtain quotes from several different places before you agree to the estimate as some moving companies might overcharge you. Also, you won’t be able to sneak an extra box or piece of furniture even if you have a binding estimate. After all, the estimate was only for the items you told them about. If you add anything new, you and the movers will have to renegotiate so it behooves you to be as upfront as possible.
Tips for a Local Move
Even if you’re moving down the street, you’ll want to stay organized when it comes to your local move. There might be no way to get rid of stress completely, but the following tips can make the transition much easier:
- Find a daycare for your kids AND pets – depending on how old your kids are they might be helpful, but young children can easily become a distraction and might even find themselves in dangerous situations. The same is true for pets. If possible, entrust your kids and pets to friends or family members.
- Choose your moving day wisely – there are a lot of things to consider when choosing when you will actually move. If you live in an apartment, you might not have that luxury since you have to be out by a certain date. However, think about the time you want the movers to show up as well as the day of the week. Weekends are usually busier, but more people might be available to help out. Weekends might be quieter, but you’ll need to take time off of work. Weigh the pros and cons beforehand so you’re not leaving the decision to the last minute.
- Ask for help – there’s no shame in asking for help. Moving is a long and tedious process so the more help you can get the better. Your best bet is to call in professional movers to help load and unload your truck, but for everything else you should rely on friends and family. Bribe them with some treats if necessary to help spread the work.
- Prepare your new home – depending on how much time you have, how far away your new home is, and whether or not someone is still occupying your new home, you might be able to prepare your new home before moving day. Take advantage of that time if you can! Do some light cleaning, look for trouble areas and patch them up, paint the walls, etc. Heck, you can even set up your small play area for your kids and pets so they have somewhere to hang out the first day/night.
Tips for a Long Distance Move
Long distance moves require a lot more planning and consideration especially if you’re moving cross-country. You will need to figure out when you will be available to receive the movers at your new place and whether you’re going to storage in transit. That means planning out your route, planned stops, and leaving plenty of room for traffic problems. Some other tips to make your long distance move go a bit smoother include:
- Updating important documents – changing your address means you’ll also need to update your information in a lot of different places. If you’re moving to a new state, you’ll need to get a new driver’s license and registration. Don’t forget that you’ll need to update your address at your bank and online ordering sites!
- Label your boxes with your name – during a long distance move your boxes will most likely be on a moving truck that is shared with other families. In order to prevent any mix ups, label every box with your name and phone number just in case it gets dropped off at the wrong house.
- Triple-check your inventory – You will need to provide a detailed inventory to the movers before they load up the truck. Don’t lose this list! When the movers arrive at your new place, triple-check to make sure everything has arrived before the movers leave. That way, you can figure out if anything is missing.
- Take extra care when packing – While you should always pack your items with care, you should be especially diligent when moving long distances. There’s more opportunities for your belongings to get damaged the longer they are on the road. Wrap your fragile items with bubble wrap, paper, and old t-shirts to prevent vibrations. Tape the sides of all your boxes for added sturdiness.

How much do local moves cost?
The cost of local moves depends on how much you’re moving. With that said, the national average for a one bedroom is $1,400.
How much do long distance moves cost?
As you might expect, long distance moves will be more expensive than local moves and varies based on a variety of factors. However, the average cost of a long distance move is $4,000.
Can’t I just rent a truck for my move?
If you’re really tight on budget then you can certainly save a lot of money by renting a van or truck. With that said, you’ll need to load and unload everything yourself and deal with traffic, parking, etc. If you’re living in an apartment building you might have to hire movers as many buildings require proof of insurance to cover any damage that happens to the building during the move. Make sure you ask your super and/or building manager if that’s the case before you rent a van!",0.9451327919960022,1984,1.558154582977295
"In line with the most recent Halloween tradition, state police are warning parents in the United States to look out for edibles in their kids’ candy ahead of this weekend’s spooky celebration.
According to Indiana State Police, authorities seized edibles in packaging virtually identical to the popular Starburst and Skittles candies just last weekend.
“Parents, here is an example of what to look for in your child’s Halloween candy this year. These were seized just this past weekend by one of our Troopers from the Lowell post. While they are packaged and marketed to look like candy, they are not. You have to look closely to see the ‘Medicated’ wording. Please thoroughly check all candy and don’t assume it’s ‘OK’ just because it looks ‘OK,’” Indian State Police shared on Facebook along with photos of the seized marijuana-unfused treats.
Last year, police departments in Pennsylvania and North Carolina issued similar warnings, which included advice to parents to discard all home-made candies children might receive during trick-or-treating.
Although skeptics frequently point out that nobody would willingly give away free marijuana to kids, particularly edibles which can be quite expensive, Yahoo News writes that children are known to ingest edibles sometimes. In fact, poison control centers in California received over 250 calls in 2017 regarding children accidentally ingesting edibles.
In any case, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released guidelines on how to safely go trick-or-treating this year amid rising coronavirus infection numbers across the country. Parents and children should follow the standard three rules: wear a mask, socially distance and wash your hands.
However, regarding the use of masks specifically, the CDC warned that “a costume mask is not a substitute for a cloth mask. Wearing a costume mask over a cloth mask can make breathing more difficult, and masks should not be worn by children under the age of 2, or by anyone who has trouble breathing.”
In general, the CDC recommends lower-risk ways of celebrating Halloween this year, including pumpkin-carving, Halloween movie nights, or open-air costume parades where people will be able to maintain a distance of more than six feet apart in order to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19.",0.9518011212348938,491,2.082451105117798

When it comes to staying healthy and reaching your exercise goals, eating is very important.

The rise of 0 sugar protein bars has changed everything for people who are health-conscious and exercise fans alike. There is no sugar in these energy bars, so they are a great choice for your workouts. Furthermore, they can help you stay on track with your health goals.
The Importance of Protein in Fitness
Protein is one of the most important building blocks for our bodies. It is essential for the maintenance and growth of our muscles, as well as for our general health and well-being. This is how the benefits of protein bars can be realized:
Post-Workout Fuel: After a workout session, your muscles have a strong desire for protein since it helps them repair and regenerate. Protein bars that include no added sugar can be a practical method to offer a rapid dose of protein. This will help assist in the recovery of muscles.
Curbing Cravings: It is well known that protein helps increase satiety. Thus, it can help you keep feeling fuller for a longer period. When it comes to regulating hunger sensations and keeping individuals from overeating in between meals, this might be useful.
Dietary Needs: Vegetarians and vegans often struggle to meet their protein needs. Therefore, protein bars produced with plant-based protein sources can be a convenient way to supplement their protein intake.
On-the-Go Nutrition: Due to the hectic nature of life, it is not always possible to eat meals at the scheduled times. Having a snack alternative that is both portable and shelf-stable, such as low-sugar protein bars, ensures that you will not have to forgo a protein boost when you are on the move.
An Introduction to Low Sugar Protein Bars
Traditional protein bars often contain added sugars, which can have negative health effects. Low-sugar protein bars, on the other hand, prioritize protein content while omitting these added sugars. However, sugars from dates, palm, and coconuts are some of the sugar substitutes that are used to sweeten these bars. These sugar substitutes do not have a major influence on the levels of sugar in the blood.
- Those watching their carbohydrate intake will find low-sugar protein bars to be an ideal choice. This is particularly true for individuals following a ketogenic diet.
- Cravings can be better managed with the support of low-sugar protein bars. Thus offering a pleasant flavor without the accompanying harmful effects of sugar.
- When compared to their sugary counterparts, they often contain fewer calories. Hence making them a more preferable option for snacking when it comes to managing one’s weight.
Benefits of Low Sugar Protein Bars
Protein bars can be an appealing grab-and-go choice for people who care about their health. The benefits of these foods can be greatly reduced, though, if sugar is added. Picking protein bars without extra sugar can improve your health and well-being in these ways:
Blood Sugar Balance: A Sweet Reward Without the Spike
Eating a lot of sugar can make your blood sugar go up and down rapidly. Thus making you feel tired and wanting more sweets. However, low-sugar protein bars help keep blood sugar levels steady. Therefore, making them a great choice for people with diabetes or who just want to avoid these glucose spikes. This steady blood sugar means that you will have more energy and be able to concentrate better throughout the day.
Cutting Down on Empty Calories and Supporting Weight Management
Added sugar usually makes you eat more calories than you need to. Moreover, empty calories don’t give you any nutrients like vitamins, minerals, or fiber. They just provide you with energy. So, if you choose 0 sugar protein bars, you can enjoy a satisfying snack without worrying about the extra calories. This can be a useful tool for controlling your weight or keeping your body in a healthy shape. Remember that watching your portions is still very important, but these bars are a healthier way to snack.
Fueling Your Keto Journey: A Snack That Will Help You Stay in Ketosis
A lot of people are interested in the ketogenic diet because it helps people burn fat for energy. To stay in ketosis, though, you need to watch how many carbs you eat carefully. Therefore, starting a keto diet can be challenging. However, Low-sugar protein bars made with few carbs and healthy fats can be helpful for those in the beginning stages. These bars provide the protein and healthy fats you need to stay energized throughout the day. Crucially, they do this without disrupting your ketosis state.
Curbing Cravings Without the Crash
Sugary treats frequently cause cravings and energy collapses. However, there is a way to keep cravings at bay without causing a crash. Bars of protein that have no sugar provide a solution. The presence of protein in these bars contributes to satiety, which is the sensation of being full. Thus helping you feel satisfied for a longer period. The reduction of cravings as well as the tendency to overeat are both factors contributing to a better diet overall. In addition, the satiating sweetness that comes from sugar substitutes offers a guilt-free enjoyment that can assist in the management of sugar cravings.
Unlocking Additional Benefits: Sweeteners Without Sugar
Some Low-sugar bars use sugar alcohols or natural sweeteners to add a little sweetness. This is a big plus since they don’t have any added sugar. Some sugar alcohols, like erythritol and stevia, taste sweet like sugar but have almost no calories. Also, they don’t change blood sugar levels much. Another natural choice that is becoming more popular is monk fruit sweetener. This fruit comes from a Southeast Asian plant and is sweet without the bad things that come with regular sugar.
Protein bars with no added sugar are more than just a quick bite. In fact, they can become valuable allies in achieving your exercise goals. Packed with high-quality protein, these bars offer a powerful benefit for muscle building. Furthermore, being free from the drawbacks of added sugars, they can also aid in weight management. However, to unlock their full potential and reach your fitness aspirations, it’s crucial to choose the right bars. Integrating them strategically into a healthy diet is also key",0.9576879143714905,1474,2.070314407348633

"You don't expect floods in France in June. It had rained on and off for days while we were in our old house in Lot-et-Garonne, but on the 1st June it poured all day. We sat and watched the water run down the road and sometimes went outside to see if the rain was easing off. Most of the time, we sat and read. It wasn't until the next day that we realised the consequences.
As the weather was still grey and drizzly, we drove to Villeneuve-sur-Lot, crossing the Lot on the way. The river is usually so placid it is full of reflections but, on this occasion, it was brown and foaming, overflowing into trees and footpaths along its banks. We heard on the news there had been heavy rain throughout central and northern France, sending rivers over their banks and killing at least two people. In Paris, the authorities watched with alarm as the Seine rose 6 metres above its normal levels. People protected their properties with sandbags and museums moved art works out of their cellars.
On the 6th of June, we started our trip home. We usually break our journey by spending a night in a bed and breakfast house in central France. On this occasion, we'd booked a place on the banks of the Cher near Vierzon. We left the A10 motorway and made our way through a couple of villages, with the view of crossing the Cher on a minor road. We found a sign saying 'Route Barrée' (Road Closed) and beyond that, a stretch of water. We retreated, tried another couple of minor roads which were supposed to cross the Cher, with the same result, and gave up. In the end, we took the motorway to Vierzon and crossed the Cher there.
When we reached the bed and breakfast, we found another 'Route Barrée' sign and a barrier. Fortunately this was just beyond the car park of the bed and breakfast, so we made it. The owners told us the water had reached to their drive. They had moved a couple of guests to a local hotel as a precaution, but the water didn't enter the buildings. They also told us the water had reached 1.6 metres in the streets of the nearby town of Romorantin-Lanthenay and the President, Monsieur Hollande, had come to see for himself.
The next day, we had to get to Dieppe for our ferry. Searching the web, we found the road was blocked between Vierzon and Orleans to the north. We went west, passing Romorantin-Lanthenay on the bypass, and reaching the Loire at Blois. The Loire is an impressive river at any time, but that day, the water was near the top of the arches of a bridge downstream. Further north, we had to cross the Seine at Rouen. It looked as if the river had flooded low-lying tracks and quaysides, but stopped short of the main road.
For us, the floods were an inconvenience but it must be terrible to see your home or business filling with filthy water and be unable to do anything. So my heart goes out to all those people in France who were flooded.",0.9898110032081604,675,1.7833292484283447

"Beef gyros are a delicious and easy meal to make at home.
They are perfect for a quick lunch or dinner and can be made ahead of time and stored in the fridge for up to a week.
But what do you eat with beef gyros?
I’m sharing 19 of the best side dishes to serve with beef gyros including salads, vegetables, dips, sauces, and more.
What to Serve with Beef Gyros?
There are many options for what to serve with beef gyros. If you want to keep it simple, you can just serve the gyros with pita bread and tzatziki sauce. You can also add in some chopped lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. For a more filling meal, you can serve the gyros with Greek salad, roasted potatoes, or rice.
Still looking for options?
Here are 19 foods you can serve with beef gyros:
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/376824693831365383/When you’re looking for a food to serve with beef gyros, I highly recommend falafel.
Falafel is a deep-fried patty made from ground chickpeas and spices.
It’s served in a pita or on its own with hummus and tahini sauce.
Falafel is great because it’s crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside, which makes it perfect for dipping into sauces.
The spices give it an earthy flavor that pairs perfectly with the boldness of beef gyros.
Also, it’s super easy to make! You can use canned chickpeas and mix them together with some spices in your blender or food processor.
Then just fry up some patties and serve them with your favorite sauces—they’re delicious!
If you’re looking for other ways to use falafel in your cooking, try adding them to salads or sandwiches!
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/193091902765851235/Tzatziki is a Greek yogurt-based dip that is really popular in the Mediterranean region.
It’s made with cucumbers, garlic, and dill—and it’s delicious!
It’s not complicated to make either.
All you need is some plain Greek yogurt, which can be purchased at most grocery stores or health food stores; some grated cucumbers; garlic cloves; and fresh dill (or dried dillweed).
You’ll also need some lemon juice and salt.
The best way to make this dip is by grating the cucumbers by hand—it gives the dish more texture than if you use a food processor or blender.
- Just grate them on a box grater until they’re fine enough for your taste.
- Then toss them with the rest of your ingredients: garlic cloves (minced), lemon juice, olive oil and salt to taste.
- Stir until well combined (but not too much).
The consistency should be creamy but not too runny—if it seems too thin add more yogurt until it reaches your desired consistency.
3. Greek Salad
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/351912462451586/Greek salad is a delicious, healthy dish that is perfect for any occasion.
The best part about Greek salad is the flavor.
It has a mix of salty and acidic flavors that balance each other out in a way that makes them both really pop!
The saltiness comes from olives and feta cheese, while the acidity comes from lemon juice and vinegar.
Both are incredibly fresh and vibrant.
Greek salads are also great because they have a lot of texture—they’re crunchy!
They’ve got cucumbers and tomatoes and onions that all add crunchy goodness to the dish, which goes well with the softness of the beef gyro meat.
And then there’s crunchy pita bread on top! You can even make your own pita bread if you’re feeling adventurous!
Greek salad doesn’t take long to make either—you can whip it up in about 20 minutes if you’re quick about it (or even less if you don’t mind having everything ready before you start cooking).
It’s good for smaller groups or families because everyone gets their own portion but still shares some common elements like the cucumber, tomato, onion and feta cheese.
You can also add olives if you like!
Greek salad is a great dish for summer eating because it’s light but filling, and it keeps well in the fridge for about a week after making it (if it lasts that long!).
4. Pasta Salad
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/400187116899505908/asta salad is a great side dish to serve with beef gyros.
I like to use this recipe, but you can also use one of your own!
Pasta salad is a great choice for serving with beef gyros because it’s got a lot of flavor and texture, but it’s not too heavy.
So if you’re looking for something that won’t weigh down your stomach or make you feel like you’ve overindulged, this is a great option.
You can use whatever kind of pasta you’d like, but I recommend using penne or bowtie pasta because they hold up well when mixed with other ingredients and won’t get soggy too quickly.
As far as difficulty goes, this recipe should be pretty simple!
It only has five ingredients total: cucumbers, feta cheese, olives, pepperoncini peppers (or just red bell pepper if you don’t want the spice), and Greek yogurt (you can also just use sour cream).
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/659707045429589617/This quick, easy and nutritious snack can be made using a variety of ingredients, including cheese, bread, butter and/or mayonnaise.
The texture of the sandwich will depends on the kind of bread you use.
For example, if you use rye bread then it will have a crunchy texture; if you choose white bread it will be soft and fluffy.
There are more than 50 types of cheeses available in the market today so you can experiment with different kinds to give your sandwich unique flavor every time.
6. Potato Salad
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/58687601386360049/Potato salad is great because it has the perfect balance of flavor, texture, and difficulty.
The flavor can be whatever you want it to be: creamy, tangy, spicy…
Potato salad is a blank canvas for your creativity!
And the texture is soft and creamy—perfectly complementing the crunchy texture of your beef gyro.
Potato salad also requires very little preparation time—making it an easy option for when you’re short on time.
You can make potato salad using just three ingredients (potatoes, mayonnaise, and mustard), but if you want to get fancy with your potato salad recipes (and who wouldn’t?), there are some additional ingredients that will take your potato salad from good to great! Ingredients like radishes, onions or garlic make it even more flavorful and tasty—but if you’re looking for something simple, don’t worry about adding anything else!
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/34762228365099300/So, I know what you’re thinking—what the heck is a burger doing in a blog post about gyros?
Well, think about it: when it comes to an event like a cookout or a barbeque, you probably want to bring something that’s easy to make and can easily be shared by everyone.
And that’s where burgers come in!
Beef gyros are great because they’re easy to make and fun to eat, but they can get kind of boring after awhile.
That’s why I always bring my favorite burger recipe whenever we have a big event at home.
My burger recipe is really simple: I just mix together ground beef with some Worcestershire sauce and seasonings, then shape the mixture into patties and grill them until they’re cooked through.
You can use whatever toppings you like on your burger—you could even try adding some greek yogurt sauce for extra flavor!
The best thing about this recipe is that it doesn’t take very long at all; it only takes about ten minutes from start to finish!
So if you’re looking for something quick, simple, and delicious for your next family gathering or weekend barbecue with friends—look no further than this tasty treat!
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/273382639878024587/Pizza is a great choice for beef gyros.
It’s got a lot of flavor and texture, it’s pretty easy to make, and you can add any ingredients you want.
The most important thing is to make sure that your pizza dough is nice and fluffy, so that it can hold up to all the toppings.
If you’re using a frozen pizza dough, let it thaw in the fridge overnight.
You can use any toppings you like!
Some good options are: pepperoni, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, bell peppers, sausage… whatever sounds good!
I like to bake my pizza on parchment paper so that it comes out easier when I’m ready to serve my guests.
And if you’re feeling adventurous?
Try making your own sauce!
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/392587292525201028/If you’re looking to serve something delicious but easy with beef gyros, I can also recommend chicken fingers (see also: What to Serve with Chicken Gyros).
Chicken is a great way to serve up meat that’s already cooked, so it’ll be ready to go when you are.
You can also make your own chicken fingers if you want to save some money, but I think it’s more fun and less stressful to just buy them at the store.
The texture of chicken fingers is crunchy and savory, which goes really well with the flavor of beef gyros.
They’re also easy to eat because they’re bite-sized—you don’t have to worry about getting sauce on your hands or having a big piece of meat in one bite.
This makes them perfect for parties where there will be lots of people eating at once!
You can find chicken fingers at most grocery stores and restaurants in your area, so they’re super convenient for last-minute dinners or picnics.
You can even bake them yourself if you want a healthier option than frying them up in oil (just be sure not to overcook them).
Chicken fingers are also made from real ingredients like bread crumbs and spices—no weird stuff added into those crispy nuggets!
10. French Fries
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/89157267621060012/I’m not sure if you’ve had the experience of eating a French fry after you’ve eaten a gyro, but it’s pretty magical.
The salty and savory flavors of the gyro—the tzatziki sauce, feta cheese, and lamb—melt into your mind as you eat it.
The crunchiness of the French fry stands up to the softness of the gyro meat.
And when you bite into them together?
If you’re thinking about making this for yourself or for guests, here are some tips:
- Use good quality potatoes (like Yukon Gold). They’ll hold up better than other varieties when frying.
- Try to get fresh ingredients from local farmers whenever possible so that you can make sure you’re serving fresh produce in your meal as well.
- Get creative with toppings! There are lots of different ways to top French fries that go beyond just ketchup and sour cream (although those are great too). You could try adding pico de gallo or guacamole; sprinkle some truffles on top; or even add some chili powder and cumin to give your fries an extra kick.
11. Macaroni Salad
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/3799980927060426/I love macaroni salad.
It’s a great side dish for any meal, but especially beef gyros.
I like to make my own macaroni salad with my favorite ingredients—tender pasta, crunchy celery and onion, and lots of mayonnaise.
It’s delicious because it’s crunchy and sweet, but also because the salty flavor of the meat complements the sweet flavors of the dressing.
The texture is perfect for dipping in your gyro wrap or just eating with a fork!
The only thing I don’t love about this meal?
It can be hard to find good macaroni salad at restaurants.
Luckily, making it at home is easy!
Here are some tips on how to get started:
- Make sure you use cooked pasta instead of uncooked noodles—they’ll absorb more sauce than raw pasta and they’ll taste better too!
- Try adding different veggies like cucumber or bell pepper for added texture and flavor
- Use Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise if you want to cut down on fat content without sacrificing taste!
12. Tabouli Salad
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/369576713183516976/The flavors of tabouli salad are delicious and fresh, and the texture is soft and satisfying.
It’s also super easy to make, especially if you use store-bought hummus!
You can even make it ahead of time, so that all you have to do is grab some pita bread and slice up some tomatoes when your guests arrive.
The ingredients are pretty much limitless; feel free to get creative and add whatever you like!
Some of my favorite ingredients include:
- sunflower seeds
- cumin seed
- mint leaves
If you’re looking for a fun, easy-to-make side dish to serve with your beef gyro, I’d recommend roasted artichokes.
They’re delicious and can be made with any number of different ingredients, which makes them versatile.
They’re also super easy to make and don’t require much effort at all.
Plus, they’re healthy—you can find a recipe that calls for just about any vegetable or herb you might have lying around in your kitchen.
So if you want to add some pep to your plate when serving up beefy gyros, give roasted artichokes a try!
14. Baked Crispy Eggplant Slices
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/14777505019321615/The flavor of these crispy eggplant slices is indescribable—you’ll have to taste them for yourself!
They’re covered in a light breading of panko bread crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper, which gives them an incredible crunch when fried in hot oil.
They’re also served with a zesty dip made from garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil.
If you’re looking for a unique dish to serve at your next party or barbecue, this is it!
The combination of flavors is amazing: the crunchy panko breading paired with the juicy slices of eggplant makes this side dish one that people will be talking about for days.
15. Cabbage Rolls
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/270990102569757682/These pork cabbage rolls (see also: What to Serve with Pork Gyros) are a great food for serving with beef gyros.
They’re a bit spicy, but not too spicy.
They’re also pretty easy to make, especially if you can find pre-made cabbage rolls in your grocery store or online.
You can use ground beef or lamb in them (or both!), which is a great way to make sure that everyone at the table has something they love.
If you want to make them yourself, start by browning some onions and garlic in olive oil, then add your meat and cook it until it’s browned.
Next, season with salt and pepper, then add some tomato sauce and water—enough to cover all of your ingredients in a single layer on top of each other so that they don’t burn while baking!
When everything is cooked through and mixed together well enough that there aren’t any dry spots anymore, let it cool before placing into the cabbage leaves themselves (make sure they’re nice and clean!).
You’ll need about 5-6 leaves per roll so plan accordingly if you want enough for everyone at your table!
Once everything’s ready, bake them at 350 degrees F for about 45 minutes until tender but still firm enough not to fall apart when you’re trying to eat them!
These are great as an appetizer or as a main course but make sure to serve them with some kind of sauce like soy sauce, Tabasco or your favorite marinara.
16. Vegetable Soup
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/561894491021710766/Vegetable soup has the right amount of flavor to compliment your gyro and will add some texture to your meal.
It’s also easy to make, which means it won’t take up too much time or effort.
The ingredients are also pretty straightforward—just some vegetables and broth!
You can use whatever vegetables you want, but I would recommend using one that has a strong flavor like mushrooms or carrots.
I also recommend adding some spices like black pepper or coriander so it doesn’t taste bland.
If you’re feeling adventurous, try adding a little bit of curry powder or cumin too!
Now that we’ve talked about how easy it is to make vegetable soup, let’s talk about some occasions that would be great for serving it: picnics, camping trips and even dinner parties!
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/824158800572296259/Salad is a great food to serve with beef gyros!
It has the perfect flavor and texture for a gyro, and it’s super easy to prepare.
If you’re trying to make salad for the first time, here are some tips:
- If you don’t like the taste of vinegar, use lemon juice instead.
- If you’re planning on making this as a side dish, don’t add too much lettuce or other greens; just enough so that your guests can enjoy a fresh bite every now and then.
- You can add any vegetables or fruits that you’d like—just make sure they’re all cut into small pieces so they’ll be easier to eat with the pita bread.
- And finally, salad is great because there are so many occasions when it’s perfectly appropriate to eat it: picnics and potlucks alike!
A mezze platter is basically just a plate of appetizers, but it’s a great way to get everyone at the table eating their vegetables in one fell swoop.
The mezze platter consists of lots of different Mediterranean-inspired dishes—often including hummus, baba ganoush, and stuffed grape leaves—and it’s served family style so everyone can try everything.
You can also serve it as an entrée by adding some grilled chicken breast or grilled lamb chops on top!
The best part about this meal is its versatility: you can serve it as an appetizer or main course at almost any occasion.
It pairs well with wine for a casual dinner party or holiday meal; add some grilled chicken breast or grilled lamb chops for a more formal dinner party; or serve it as your main course on Super Bowl Sunday!
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/567031409348612671/If you’re looking for a great protein-packed side dish to serve with beef gyros, grilled chicken kabobs are the way to go.
They’re easy to make, very flavorful and delicious.
They can be served with a dipping sauce of your choice: tzatziki, hummus or even ranch dressing works great!
There are tons of different ways you can prepare this dish depending on your personal preferences.
You can use skewers made out of metal or wood; just make sure that the sticks won’t fall apart when you grill them.
You can also add different spices like cumin or coriander seeds to give them an extra kick.
To make these kabobs even tastier, try adding some bell peppers and eggplants – they will add color to your plate and will also give it an extra crunchy texture which is always nice!

Much of the destruction and death from Monday's 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Turkey lies across the border in northern Syria, a region already ravaged by more than a decade of civil war and the myriad crises that have flowed from it.
Syrian officials have already reported at least 656 people dead in government-held areas of the country, according to the Associated Press. In northwest Syria, a region held by rebels, aid groups operating there said at least 450 people died, with many hundreds injured, according to the AP.
And as the death toll continues to rise, residents and aid groups in the country's northern region have described disastrous scenes of collapsed buildings, packed hospitals, desperate parents clutching unconscious children and frantic rescue workers digging through rubble.
""This is the last thing people need in Syria,"" said Jomah Al Qassim, a Syrian aid worker currently across the border in Gaziantep, Turkey.
Since Syria's civil war began in 2011, unending disasters have beset this region of the country – thousands of civilian deaths, extensive infrastructure damage, shortages of water and electricity, the spread of COVID-19 and cholera. Al Qassim described it as ""an accumulation, a heap, of crises.""
""People were already exhausted,"" he said.
""What happened today is harder than all the years that have passed, from bombing and everything we've gone through,"" said Hamid Qutaymi, a worker with Syria Civil Defense, the Syrian volunteer aid organization also called the White Helmets, who spent Monday working as a first responder.

Syria's civil war began in 2011 when protesters, inspired by the success of uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa, called for an end to the repressive regime of Bashar Assad. But Assad ordered a violent crackdown, launching the civil war that is still active today. His forces have now retaken control of most of the populated parts of the country. But some areas – like in Idlib – remain under opposition control.
More than 300,000 civilians were killed from March 2011 through March 2021, amounting to 1.5% of the country's population, according to a report published by the United Nations human rights office last year.
A ceasefire brokered in early 2020 has cooled the most heated fighting in the last few years. But five foreign military forces and a number of other armed groups are still active inside the country, and humanitarian groups report that thousands of civilians continue to die each year as a result.
The conflict has irreparably altered daily life in the wartorn parts of the country, including northern Syria. In 2018, the U.N. estimated that the war had caused more than $120 billion in damage to roads, infrastructure and homes. In 2017, the World Bank estimated that nearly a third of all homes in Aleppo and Idlib had been damaged or destroyed in the conflict.
At least half of the country's prewar population has been displaced, either internally or as refugees, according to the U.N.; of those still inside Syria, the U.N. estimates that 90% live in poverty. Prices of food have skyrocketed. Drought, high temperatures and the widespread destruction of water infrastructure have combined to cause a water crisis, which in turn has exacerbated crises with electricity and healthcare.
Now, Monday's earthquake has added yet another layer of misery.
""We're at the pinnacle of despair right now,"" said Raed Saleh, director of the White Helmets.
For years during the Syrian civil war, the White Helmets worked in opposition areas to rescue civilians from the aftermath of airstrikes. Now, they and other aid groups are racing to search for survivors in the wreckage of buildings brought down by the earthquake.
The damage from the earthquake is much more widespread than that of any one airstrike, Saleh said. But at least today the search and rescue teams could operate without the usual fear of a follow-up airstrike, he said – a grim positive.
Prolonging the misery for families forced out of their homes was the winter weather, with rain expected into the evening Monday, followed by cold weather dipping below freezing at night.
Still, as aftershocks continued hours after the original earthquake, aid groups were urging residents to not return to damaged homes until the buildings could be inspected for structural integrity.
""The situation outside is also very stormy and rainy, with snow as well. But we told them their safety is more important,"" said Saleh.
The number of dead and injured had already overwhelmed hospitals in the affected area, said Ahmed Ghandour, a doctor working in Idlib province.
""There is no space for all of them,"" he said, adding that soon there would be a lack of medical supplies due to the sheer scale of casualties. ""Inshallah, we will do all our best to treat them, to help more people.""

It looks like the rain might finally be slowing down, but that just means the clean-up can begin. Among the downed trees and mudslides, there are also some ocean issues for you to keep in mind. This much rain carries huge amounts of bacteria and pollution straight through the stormdrain system to the beach, and can also cause sewage spills. Make sure you stay out of the ocean for a full 72 hours and avoid stormdrain impacted and enclosed beaches for 5 to 10 days after a storm, to give the bacteria time to disperse. You might even want to wait a little bit longer, given how much rain fell.

Natural ASX is a natural carotenoid from the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis. It can be found in abundance in arctic marine environments, as well as in fresh water rock pools all over the world. Highly praised for its many nutritional and anti-aging benefits, ASX is thought to be Nature’s best defence against oxidative stress.
Around 95% of the astaxanthin on the market is produced synthetically, but CORE ASX® contains a superior form that is natural, bioavailable and clinically proven. Produced to the highest standards of quality and safety, the ASX used in this formula is of the highest concentration and purity available.
Natural ASX has a unique molecular structure that makes it hundreds of times stronger than many other antioxidant molecules. When compared with some of the most well-known antioxidants, ASX demonstrates a superior ability for combatting singlet-oxygen (the most damaging free radical).
The strongest singlet-oxygen quencher among anti-aging molecules.
6,000 times stronger than Vitamin C
800 times stronger than COQ10
110 times stronger than Vitamin E
4.9 times stronger than Beta-Carotene
2.6 times stronger than Lutein
Nishida et al (2007). Carotenoid Science. Vol.11:16-20.
Natural ASX has a wide range of benefits for both men and women, supporting the needs of a healthy active lifestyle, in both the young and the aging.
Featuring in more than 400 peer-reviewed studies, ASX has been shown to support:
The immune system is the body’s natural defence against infections, and like many other parts of the body, it functions best when it is protected.
Natural ASX is capable of both strengthening and balancing the immune system due to its strong antioxidant, antiinflammatory and immunomodulating properties. This improves the immune system’s ability to defend the body and promotes a faster inflammation response.
As we age, our immune response capability becomes reduced and this makes us more vulnerable to attack from bacteria, viruses and other external threats. Natural ASX helps to enhance antibody production and protects immune cells against oxidative stress, thus improving the defence against inflammation and outside invaders.
Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body, which can lead to cell and tissue damage. This damage plays a key role in the aging process.
As humans, we are constantly exposed to free radicals in our environment. Common risk factors include pollution, sun radiation, smoking, consuming alcohol, and an unhealthy diet. A high level of exposure can restrict the body’s ability to fight the harmful effects of free radicals.
Antioxidants help to counteract this process and can provide cellular protection against the damaging effects of free radicals. The unique structure of ASX make it one of the most powerful antioxidants known to science, giving it a superior ability to neutralise free radicals.
Despite their intention to prevent oxidative stress, it is common for antioxidants to also have some kind of pro-oxidant effect in the body. This is where ASX can be described as a ‘pure antioxidant’ since it has no pro-oxidant activity even when subjected to enormous amounts of stress.
Natural ASX provides protection to all layers of the skin to support increased hydration, elasticity and smoothness. This helps to optimize the health and radiance of skin, enhance your natural beauty and reduce the visible signs of aging.
The outer appearance of the skin is a reflection of a person’s inner health and vitality. While some creams and lotions may provide a quick fix for skin rejuvenation, taking ASX in oral form helps to strengthen the collagen layer and promote healthy, radiant skin from the inside out.
Natural ASX provides such a superior level of skin protection that skin care experts and health professionals all over the world have endorsed the ingredient as an essential anti-aging nutrient.
Intense physical exercise increases the production of free radicals in the body. Free radicals are not only responsible for causing oxidative stress – they can also cause muscle soreness and fatigue. In its role as an antioxidant, natural ASX is able to counteract these effects and support muscle performance, endurance and recovery.
Natural ASX can help to assist athletes in a wide range of sports and physical activities, from helping runners and cyclists increase their endurance to helping weightlifters improve their power output. When it comes to boosting athletic performance, natural ASX is ahead of the competition.
The natural ASX contained in the muscle tissue of salmon is what gives the fish its distinctive red color. However, scientists now believe that it is this ASX in their muscles that allow salmon to swim upstream for hundreds of kilometers against strong and forceful currents. This is one of the greatest endurance feats in all of Nature, and it is powered by natural ASX.
Natural ASX is a multi-functional ingredient with benefits not just for the body, but also helping to keep the mind clear and focused. The brain is the primary control center of the body, controlling everything from physical movement to thoughts and emotions, so it makes sense to protect this vital organ as much as we can.
As we age, the brain’s natural antioxidant capacity starts to decline, and it becomes more vulnerable to attack from free radicals. This makes natural ASX an essential nutrient for those aged 40 and above who want to sustain their brain health and cognitive function.
Recommended by neurologists and health experts, natural ASX has been shown to reduce age-related forgetfulness, multi-tasking and alertness – helping to keep your mind sharp as you age.
Seabirds are known to consume large amounts of fish and marine algae that are rich in natural ASX. Once it has been digested, researchers believe that the ASX is stored in the eyes of the bird where it provides protection against UV damage. It is also thought to maintain the bird’s refocus speed, allowing it to ‘zoom in’ on its prey.
Digital Eye Strain (DES) is a growing problem in the modern world. We work on computers all day long, check our smartphones in between, and then watch TV or play video games when we get home. As we rely more and more on digital devices, our eyes are starting to feel the fatigue.
The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health in the USA found that over 88% of office workers have reported eyestrain, while 8 out of 10 European millennials experience digital device related eye fatigue. This modern problem is in need of a modern solution.
Various clinical studies have shown that natural ASX can help to refocus tired eyes and improve some of the symptoms linked to DES, such as eye fatigue, eye irritation and blurred vision. It does this by improving retinal blood flow, balancing the eye’s capillary circulation, and reducing cellular inflammation.
CORE ASX® also contains two essential vitamins that work together in perfect synergy – vitamin C and vitamin E. These natural antioxidants help to support ASX in the protection of cells against oxidative stress, but also have their own unique benefits for human health.
Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant with a wide range of benefits for everyday health and wellbeing. This diverse vitamin supports everything from immune health and psychological function to collagen production and skin health. It is also involved in energy production and can help to reduce feelings of tiredness and fatigue, giving you that extra spring in your step you need to reach your goals.
CORE ASX® contains natural D-alpha tocopherol, the most biologically active form of vitamin E. Derived from vegetable oil, natural vitamin E is a potent antioxidant that supports the immune system and helps to maintain a healthy heart.
When combined, vitamins C and E offer an even greater benefit by forming an ‘antioxidant network’ in the body. Vitamin C is able to regenerate the oxidised form of vitamin E, resulting in a process known as ‘vitamin E recycling’ where the antioxidant function of vitamin E is continuously restored. This enhanced level of antioxidant protection is more than either vitamin can offer on its own.

"Qiraat, the various methods of reciting the Quran, hold immense significance in the Islamic tradition. Among these, Warsh an Nafe stands out for its unique characteristics and historical importance. This article delves into the depth of Warsh an Nafe, exploring its origins, development, and impact on Islamic scholarship.
The concept of Qiraat dates back to the time of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), who received the Quran through the angel Jibreel. Over time, different recitation methods emerged, each attributed to renowned scholars. Warsh an Nafe, one of the ten recognized Qiraat, traces its roots to two eminent figures: Imam Warsh and Imam Nafe.
Biography of Imam Warsh
Born as Uthman ibn Sa’id al-Qutbi, Imam Warsh hailed from Egypt. He was a prominent student of Imam Nafe and dedicated his life to mastering the art of Quranic recitation.
Contributions to Qiraat
Imam Warsh’s contributions to Qiraat are monumental. His meticulous approach to recitation and strict adherence to the rules set by his teacher, Imam Nafe, helped in preserving and propagating the Warsh an Nafe method.
Biography of Imam Nafe
Imam Nafe ibn Abd al-Rahman, originally from Medina, was a highly respected Quranic scholar. His dedication to perfecting the recitation of the Quran earned him a distinguished place in Islamic history.
Contributions to Qiraat
Imam Nafe’s systematic approach to teaching and his efforts in standardizing the recitation methods were crucial in the development of Warsh an Nafe. His influence extended far beyond his lifetime, shaping the future of Quranic recitation.
The Significance of Warsh an Nafe
Warsh an Nafe is predominantly practiced in North Africa, particularly in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and parts of West Africa. Its influence in these regions underscores its cultural and religious significance.
The adoption of Warsh an Nafe in various regions has led to the preservation of a rich cultural heritage, deeply intertwined with the recitation and memorization of the Quran.
Characteristics of Warsh an Nafe
Warsh an Nafe is known for its distinct pronunciation rules and phonetic variations. It incorporates specific phonemes and articulatory techniques that set it apart from other Qiraat.
Differences from Other Qiraat
Unlike Hafs an Asim, the most widely recited Qiraat, Warsh an Nafe exhibits unique vowel lengths, pronunciation of certain letters, and differences in grammatical structures.
Warsh an Nafe adheres to strict pronunciation rules, emphasizing clarity and precision in recitation. This includes specific rules for elongation (madd), merging letters (idgham), and articulation points (makharij).
Certain phonemes in Warsh an Nafe are pronounced differently compared to other Qiraat. For instance, the pronunciation of the letter “ض” (Dhad) and the elongation of vowels are distinctive features.
Warsh an Nafe presents subtle variations in syntax, affecting the structure and flow of verses. These differences, though minor, contribute to the unique rhythm of the recitation.
Morphological changes in Warsh an Nafe include variations in verb forms and noun cases, which can alter the meaning and interpretation of the verses.
Tajweed, the art of Quranic recitation, is fundamental to Warsh an Nafe. It involves precise rules governing pronunciation, intonation, and rhythm, ensuring the correct delivery of the verses.
Reciters of Warsh an Nafe follow specific practices, such as the pauses (waqf) and the emphasis on certain letters (ghunna), to maintain the integrity of the recitation.
Teaching and Learning Warsh an Nafe
Numerous institutions worldwide offer specialized courses in Warsh an Nafe, providing a structured curriculum for students to master this Qiraat.
Traditional methods of learning Warsh an Nafe include memorization (hifz) and oral transmission (talaqqi) from a qualified teacher (shaykh), ensuring the preservation of authenticity.
Warsh an Nafe in Modern Times
In modern times, Warsh an Nafe continues to be practiced and revered. It is used in daily prayers, Quranic competitions, and educational settings, reflecting its enduring relevance.
With the advent of technology, numerous digital resources, such as apps and online courses, have made learning Warsh an Nafe more accessible to a global audience.
Challenges and Preservation
Efforts to preserve Warsh an Nafe include the documentation of oral traditions, recording of recitations, and the establishment of dedicated research centers.
Challenges in preserving Warsh an Nafe include the risk of homogenization with other Qiraat, loss of oral traditions, and the need for continuous scholarly engagement.
Comparison with Hafs an Asim
Both Warsh an Nafe and Hafs an Asim share a common origin in the Quranic revelation and adhere to the principles of Tajweed.
The primary differences lie in pronunciation, grammatical structures, and phonetic rules, which result in distinct recitation styles.
Impact on Islamic Scholarship
Influence on Scholars
Warsh an Nafe has influenced numerous scholars, contributing to the rich tapestry of Islamic jurisprudence, theology, and linguistics.
Contributions to Islamic Studies
The study of Warsh an Nafe has enriched Islamic studies, providing insights into the linguistic and phonetic diversity of the Quran.
In conclusion, Warsh an Nafe is not just a method of Quranic recitation but a profound expression of Islamic heritage and scholarship. Its unique features, historical significance, and enduring relevance make it an invaluable part of the Muslim tradition. As we continue to explore and preserve this Qiraat, we honor the legacy of Imam Warsh and Imam Nafe, ensuring that their contributions resonate through generations.

"Why I transitioned to a vegan diet and how I did it
Let me start off by saying that I am not an expert, nutrionist or doctor. I do not have a degree in anything human anatomy related – in fact, I pursued nursing for a hot two months my sophomore year of college, but quit after I failed my first two anatomy exams. Spoiler alert: I turned to journalism.
My main reason for hopping off the animal by-products train was to to lose weight, more specifically that stubborn pudge slightly hanging over my waistline. However, I’ve found that over the past five months, I no longer have those brain fogs or stress headaches that used to prevent me from sleeping at night. And so, I feel compelled to share the good news with everyone who will listen.
I love steak. I love cheese. Giving both up were farfetched for me – or so I thought. I hired a personal trainer at the top of year after a chance encounter with him in the local Ralphs. He was buying water and healthy stuff – I was buying cookies and chips. We hit it off, talking about all things health and wellness, and so we set up a consultation.
Blaze and I had been training for a few weeks when he suggested a diet change. “You’d slim down a lot more if you cut out dairy,” he suggested. I wasn’t a stranger to healthy eating, I’d just fallen off the wagon as most of us do around the holidays. In fact, I don’t buy meat for my home, and would only partake if I were at a restaurant or a friend’s house. So cutting dairy out of my diet, I thought, wouldn’t be a problem.
Cutting dairy, turned into cutting out dairy and meat, and then soon enough, all things animal related were completely out (minus my supplements in gelatin capsules, but there’s seriously no way around this for me). “Am I on a vegan diet?” I thought to myself one afternoon while making lunch for a friend. And I was – a whole entire month in, and didn’t even realize it.
Not making a big deal out of it really set the tone for how I approached my diet. I didn’t make an announcement to any and everyone coming over for dinner, it wasn’t announced in my social media profiles, and I didn’t have it tattooed on my forehead. It was a personal choice for me, and not an issue of morality. And I’ve had some pretty awesome health results as a result.
I’ve outlined some key steps that helped me transition seamlessly.
Drink lots of water
I started with a trainer, but you totally don’t need to. Working out for me meant that I had to up my water intake. And once I did that, I started noticing that I was no longer craving super unhealthy stuff. I researched it, and came across this really good article that proved that drinking water can reset your tastebuds. I told you – I’m not crazy.
Eat whole foods for breakfast
When asked about 4 ways to reset your tastebuds, Candice Kumai, author of Clean Green Eats: 100+ Clean-Eating Recipes to Improve Your Whole Life, made this her very first step: “Think whole!” Breakfast was an effortless way for me to lead into this.
Instead of cereal, pancakes, or air (I had a serious problem with skipping breakfast), I would grab a few bananas while on my way out the door in the morning. Three of them was all I needed to feel satisfied, not full. I mix it up now with whatever fruit is in season. Rinse them off, place them in your bag and go – no prep-work necessary.
Cut meat out of your diet sloooooooowly
I did this cold turkey since I rarely ate it, but feel free to start cutting out the meat that you eat least often so you don’t completely shock your body. For example, if you only eat beef every once and a while, start with phasing this out first. Once you get the hang of it, slowly phase out the others.
Cut dairy out of your diet
Again, cold turkey for me. I’m no stranger to dairy alternatives like almond milk and vegan butter, but I loved cheese too much to phase this out. The way I’m built, I could finish off a whole 1/4 lb bag of Boar’s Head White American cheese in one sitting. However, not buying it for my home made it easier for me to cut it from my diet. Out of sight, out of mind, I guess.
One of the most frequent questions I get when someone inquires about my diet is “well, how do you get your protein?” I HATE that question, but the truth is, I found it kind of hard to eat a completely balanced meal on this diet. And that’s where supplements came in. I take a variety of them – b12, iron, multivitamin, calcium, to name a few – and started taking these specifically after I assessed what my body needed.
After being on a vegan diet for a few months, I started noticing that I was pretty fatigued in the morning. I did a quick google search and found that b12 is an energy vitamin that can only be found in eggs, seafood and dairy, and since I was no longer eating any of them, I figured that I should add b12 to my diet. I gave it about a week of taking it daily, and my fatigue went away. I then researched other frequent vitamins that vegans/vegetarians take, and added them to the list as well. I also recommend getting your blood work done to make sure you take the supplements that your body needs. No two bodies are the same, so adopt what works best for you.
And yes. I still can eat lots of desserts, just vegan ones.
Like I mentioned previously, I’m not a nutritionist, so if you’re considering changing your diet you should consult with a doctor or a professional first to make sure you’re getting the proper nutrients needed for your body!
Hope this helps!",0.9746606945991516,1323,0.9355831146240234

"Arthritis is a general term used to describe a range of conditions affecting the joints, the areas where two or more bones meet. It is characterized by symptoms such as pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced range of motion in the affected joints. There are many types of arthritis, with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis being among the most common. While arthritis is more commonly seen in older adults, it can affect people of all ages, including children. Treatment for arthritis often involves medication, physical therapy, lifestyle changes, and in severe cases, surgical intervention, all aimed at managing symptoms and improving quality of life.
When you think of psoriasis, you probably picture those red, flaky skin patches that can cause discomfort and self-consciousness. But what if we told you that psoriasis doesn’t just affect your skin—it can impact your joints too? In fact, up to 25% of people with psoriasis experience joint pain, and for some, that pain turns into a more serious condition known as psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
It’s a connection that surprises many, but researchers are actively studying it. And the results could transform how we approach psoriasis and arthritis, helping people live healthier, pain-free lives.
While psoriasis primarily affects the skin, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a type of inflammatory arthritis that impacts the joints. It can cause swelling, stiffness, and pain, which can be just as uncomfortable as the skin symptoms of psoriasis, if not more. What’s more, PsA can develop silently in some people, without obvious skin symptoms beforehand.
Here’s where things get interesting: about one-third of people with psoriasis may eventually develop PsA. This means that many people who currently deal with psoriasis are at risk of future joint pain—but experts are working hard to figure out why this happens and how to stop it before it starts.
In an exciting effort to better understand the link between psoriasis and joint pain, researchers from Oxford University, University College Dublin, and other leading institutions are conducting a massive international study called the HIPPOCRATES Project. The goal? To uncover early warning signs of PsA and find ways to prevent it from developing in people with psoriasis.
So far, the project has been tracking nearly 3,000 psoriasis patients, with 25% of them already experiencing joint symptoms. But this is just the beginning. Over the course of three years, the study will follow these patients, gathering insights into when and why PsA appears—and how it can be stopped.
What makes the HIPPOCRATES Project so groundbreaking is the scope and the approach. Researchers are collecting detailed health information from participants through online questionnaires and even using finger-prick blood samples that people can send in by mail. This allows patients to participate from home, no matter where they live, and ensures that researchers gather a large, diverse pool of data.
The project plans to recruit 25,000 people with psoriasis across 12 European countries, giving scientists an unprecedented amount of data to analyze. This data could lead to the discovery of key risk factors that predict who will develop PsA, opening the door to early interventions.
The ultimate goal of this study is to find out if we can prevent psoriatic arthritis from developing in the first place. And while there’s no magic pill just yet, researchers are exploring a variety of lifestyle interventions that could help. These include things like:
Regular exercise to keep joints healthy
Stress management techniques to reduce inflammation
Dietary adjustments to support overall well-being
The idea is that by identifying high-risk individuals early, we can recommend simple changes that might keep arthritis at bay and improve quality of life.
Psoriatic arthritis can be life-altering. It doesn’t just cause joint pain—it can also affect mobility and lead to long-term joint damage if left untreated. That’s why the HIPPOCRATES Project is such an important step forward in our understanding of psoriasis and arthritis.
By focusing on early detection and prevention, this research could dramatically change how we treat people with psoriasis, giving them tools to manage their skin and joint health long before PsA develops. Plus, with so many patients involved from different countries, the findings are likely to have a wide-reaching impact.
As the HIPPOCRATES Project continues to unfold, we’re hopeful that its discoveries will lead to better treatments and even preventative measures for PsA. And at the American Arthritis Foundation, we’ll be watching closely to bring you the latest updates on this groundbreaking research.
If you or someone you know is living with psoriasis, staying informed about this connection between skin and joint health is key. Whether through lifestyle changes or new treatments on the horizon, there are steps you can take to protect your joints and improve your overall well-being.
Stay tuned for more on the link between psoriasis and joint health—and follow us for the latest in arthritis research, treatment options, and wellness tips!

Joe Biden’s managers fed him the warning below of coming food shortages due to sanctions imposed on Russia, cutting off significant wheat and oil supplies to Europe and America.
US farming inputs will be cut off too, including potash, ammonia, and urea in fertilizer.
The sanctions are thus designed to harm American and Europe, and, in response, Russia and China may move away from the US dollar.
Rising fuel and food prices could lead to social unrest as more Americans and Europeans become unable to afford to eat, put gas in their cars, or heat their homes.
With modern agriculture, there is no reason today for any developed country to lack food.

"We are a leading plant hire company based in the UK that provides a range of equipment, including excavators. Our company has a huge range of machines and excavator attachments in Glatton ready to hire when you need us, offering delivery to a range of sites across the country.
From large excavators to mini excavators, which weigh 930 kg, and attachments, we have everything you need to get the job done in one place. Hiring machines like this can offer many benefits and is often cheaper than buying diggers outright.

An excavator is a piece of heavy machinery that is commonly used in construction in Glatton. You may hear excavators also referred to as diggers because they are primarily used for digging work, but they can offer much more than this.
An excavator is made up of several main parts, including the boom, dipper or stick, bucket, and cab. All of these take place on the rotating platform of the machine, which is also on wheels for maximum versatility. These kinds of machines come from brands such as JCB and Caterpillar and you can find them on most construction sites in the UK.
There are different kinds of excavators available, which generally refers to the way they get their power. For example, a hydraulic excavator works with hydraulic cylinders, hydraulic fluid, and hydraulic motors, which are used in the digging work. With this in mind, a hydraulic excavator is very different from cable-operated excavators, for example, not only in their functions but controls.
As well as being categorised based on their power, these kinds of machines are also categorised based on their weight in kg, which determines their performance. The operating weight (in kg) of an excavator will determine when and where it can be used.
To ensure we can meet the needs of all our Glatton clients, we have a large range of diggers available to hire at all times. We cover all needs, from compact excavators to wheeled excavators and hydraulic excavators, to ensure we can reach a wide audience.

These powerful tools do not come cheap in Glatton, but this price tag won't matter if you can rent them, as this makes them more affordable.
Flexible rental periods
Instead of having a powerful machine on-site at all times, renting it is ideal as it allows you to have access to it when you need it. You will reach for the machine when it is needed, and it will not take up space on the site after this.
Various options available
The progress of your project does not have to stop in its tracks because you do not have the ideal equipment on site, as this is where we come in. We have every design, weight (kg), and capacity of the excavator and its attachments available to hire.
This ensures that you can reach your deadline, no matter how tight it may be, as we have the diggers you need. We can deliver them to your site at a time that suits you and ensure that your work is taken off the ground, regardless of what may be trying to stop you.

Renting an excavator in the UK can start at around £80 per day, VAT excluded. The price will vary based on the type of excavators you need, such as their kg weight.
Compact excavators can be useful in a range of circumstances. The smallest compact excavator starts at 930kg, and this can be very useful in compact areas. With such a small starting weight of just over 900 kg in most cases, a mini digger is ideal for residential hire and use in small areas.
They can also feature a bucket, arm, and rotating cab but on a smaller scale for tight spaces.
Operating a mini digger of around 930 kg or more, then a license may be needed. To use this on private property, you will not need a license, but if this will feature on main roads and other public areas, then an additional license may be required.
On average, 20-tonne excavators are reported to move 490 tons of dirt per hour, based on specific brands. This can vary based on the bucket, the type of digger used, and whether any other feature is required.
Driving and using an excavator for the first time may be difficult, which is why additional training may be required. Controlling this equipment on uneven terrain or in tight spaces can also be difficult and requires training.
An efficient excavator can dig between 350 to 1000 cubic yards in a day, based on the kind you are using and the kind of attachments used.
As a Glatton plant hire company, we have a range of machinery available to rent from us.

"On Thursday the 22nd of February, the form 5’s and 6’s had their own internal Lent Retreat. The girls were extremely shocked at this; as not only were all classes for the day cancelled; but no mention of this happening was made known to them until the the morning of the retreat. At first; they were so delighted to skip class; but then horror struck them as they were told it was a day without cellphones, followed by the cellphones being taken away. (Insert heartache here). However, the girls did appreciate and enjoy the day of reflection and prayer.
Between morning and lunch; and the girls were split into their form classes and 3 guest speakers rotated to each form for during this allotted time.

- Ways to encourage fidelity in your relationships:
- -Romantic Relationships: encourage a relationship with God in your relationship, respect each other boundaries
- -Relationship with God: a most important; listen to him and do as he says as he will be your guide eg. Abraham and Sarah
- -Friendships: no gossiping, be honest with one another, respect their boundaries
- -Yours and your Parents Relationship: following the rules; helping them when necessary; be truthful; don’t disobey them.
The 2nd guest speaker was Ms. Monica Joseph, who spoke on the topic of Modesty. Here are some of the things she pointed out:
- Women set the standard in society
- How do you set the standard? : Dress well; because you are judged when you dress inappropriately
- Modesty demands respect
- Dress to Dignity- If you can see your self worth then you will dress according to your self worth.
- We need to take responsibility in how we behave and how we dress
- A woman is the strongest force in nature when she knows who she is and what they want to so
The 3rd speaker was Ms. Laeticia Devauz who spoke about Love and God. Some key elements mentioned during the discussion with her were:
- Love is selflessness
- Know who you are and what you want
- Love is sacrifice
- Love in friendship is being there for them even when you are struggling.
- God loves unconditionally
- We were created with a purpose; but God is the only one who knows that purpose

"These chromed plastic pieces were only produced for a few Jaguar Cars main showrooms in the U.K. We have learned that many of these were destroyed when the company either refurbished or closed down showrooms. So it is believed not many of these display pieces survived.

"Garret Donnelly is one of those editors that everyone wants to collaborate with not only because of his editing skills, but also because he’s a pleasure to be around. He’s always made it a point to do the best work possible while maintaining a positive attitude. It’s safe to say that taking this approach has allowed him to move up the editing ranks quickly and work on such hit shows as Narcos: Mexico, NOS4A2, Knightfall, 24: Legacy, and Homeland.
I was fortunate to be Garret’s assistant editor on two shows and was able to co-edit an episode with him. He was also very instrumental in me being promoted to full-time editor and also getting my second editing credit. We became good friends and I consider him one of my mentors. I’ve learned a lot from him, everything from how to be a better storyteller to navigating office politics.
In episode 17 of the Hollywood Editing Mentor podcast, Garret and I talk about the three early stages of an editorial career in scripted television – becoming an assistant editor, getting promoted to editor, and landing the second editing gig. Being that he guided me through this process, Garret and I share practical advice through real life experiences that we’ve lived through either by ourselves or while working together.

Poarch claimed that the lyrics stem from her experiences of being bullied as a child. She revealed that growing up, she got bullied for her American-Filipino features, and since Poarch always wanted to be a singer, she wanted her first song to be meaningful and help listeners.
Besides Valkyrae, the music video features other famous personalities like Larray, ZHC, and Bretman Rock, who actually helped Poarch record the ad-libs for the music video. With this new single and video, Poarch is launching her music career with Warner Records.
Claim to Fame
Poarch is definitely making the most of her viral fame for her new music career. The singer rose to meteoric fame when her TikTok video of lip-syncing to Millie B’s infectious track ‘M to the B’ with rhythmic bouncing and quirky facial expressions went viral.
The clip amassed a whopping half a billion views and 48 million likes and became one of the most-watched videos in the app history. The video was so viral that she was averaging around a million followers each day, and in a year, she gained over 40 million followers.
Last year BuzzFeed News investigated why Poarch’s video was so addictive. The outlet spoke to Craig Richard, a professor of biopharmaceutical sciences at Shenandoah University who studied the phenomenon behind internet trends.
The professor revealed that people enjoy looking at attractive faces. Poarch’s new camera effect video where the head is centered for the viewer actually caused a release of dopamine and kept viewers focused and intrigued.
Criticized for Zero Effort Video and Controversial Tattoos
Following the viral success of Poarch’s “M to the B” video, she continued to post a variety of videos in the same style, lip-syncing and making cosplay expressions using TikTok’s Face Zoom effect. In several of the videos, she even credited Afiq Hakim, another TikToker, for inspiration.
Although Poarch continued to rise in fame, skeptics perceived her as undeserving and criticized her for low-effort lip-syncing and head bobbing videos. They felt that she was famous for no reason. However, this was not the only time she came under fire.
She was embroiled in the biggest controversy when her tattoo reminiscent of Japan’s “rising sun” flag caught attention. Her tattoo featured a red circle and 16 rays emanating similar to the Japanese flag. CNN reported that the flag is a symbol of Japanese imperialism.
Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported that the flag is heavily linked with Japan’s colonization of the Korean peninsula in the early to mid-1900s. Poarch has addressed the tattoo on multiple social media platforms. Her apology posted on TikTok caused further displeasure as she was accused of being insincere and taking the matter lightheartedly.
Nevertheless, no matter what Poarch does, she only seems to get more famous.",0.9667189121246338,770,1.062717080116272

Holosite | /The Wraiths |
The Wraiths is one of the galaxy's oldest mercenary organizations. They have existed as long as anyone can remember. A hybrid starfighter/commando unit originally headquartered near Endor, the organization was purportedly founded by a Mon Calamari blaster-for-hire known as Tibo Doinds circa Year 0 Day 362. As of Year 17, The Wraiths are an independent Mercenary Group led by Zao Nephalem. The Wraiths are often questioned about their loyalty to The Trade Federation. The Wraiths are owned by Navik Ikron, however, they are independently operated.
- ""To categorize The Wraiths with more common mercenaries, for whom profit is the only standard against which to measure their decisions, this could not be further from the truth. For a Wraith, money is only a means to an end. A Wraith accepts payment because they must restore equipment after a fight; their fee high to ward off those who would make frivolous requests. But a Wraith is motivated only by a drive to be the best, by the joy of battle, and by an imperative to stand with honour as the galaxy's elite. When a Wraith accepts a task he sees it through to the very end...""
- — Plaque on the wall of The Wraiths Members Hall, placed by Tibo Doinds on The Wraiths founding day.
Following the brutal subjugation of Mon Calamari populace by the Galactic Empire, an outraged Tibo Doinds and his loyal comrade Elijah Nerwal formed The Wraiths mercenary unit with the sole purpose of winning back their beloved planet. In their first operation, Tibo and the newly-formed Wraiths raided a space station that held Imperial supplies and a Marauder-class Corvette. The raid's success demonstrated the assembled warriors' might. The Wraiths took possession of the corvette and munitions continuing to pummel the Imperial space station until finally a flotilla of Imperial warships was dispatched to drive them off.
Sending recruiters to the Outer Rim worlds, The Wraiths began to swell their numbers. Soon-to-be-famous personnel recruited during this early period included Venix ""Fi're"" Soyak, Tacitus Publius, Navik Ikron, Samus Augill, Kam Farlight, and Rygel Starshifter. Soon the best pilots and soldiers in the galaxy were flocking to the worlds of Enigma and Endor, the Wraith's strongholds. Tibo had trained the sentients driving the group well. They quickly became the strongest and largest mercenary organization in the galaxy, offering their services to those who could not fight in order to earn the money and equipment necessary to uphold their ideals.
But The Wraiths were still a young organization; misfortune struck. The Empire hadn't forgotten the damage The Wraiths had inflicted. Their agents eventually caught up with Tibo and his Mon Calamari assistant and arrested them for crimes against the Empire. They were consigned to an unknown planetary prison, and are believed to remain there to this day.
Tibo's loss struck The Wraiths to the core, but they took the blow and rebounded stronger than ever. As the Empire forgot about what they believed to be a ragtag group and focused its efforts against the Rebel Alliance, Wraith leaders took the opportunity to boost themselves to new heights unmolested. Under Tibo's second-in-command, Navik Ikron and the hot shot pilot Venix Fi're a.k.a. Venix Soyak, The Wraiths outfitted themselves with new warships and a formidable arsenal.
As The Wraiths grew, so too did their reputation, eventually spreading all the way into the remote sectors of the Outer Rim. Settlers in the Moddell Sector contracted The Wraiths to defend several planets from Sanyassan Marauders — a raider culture local to the sector. This would prove to be a turning point for The Wraiths. As they took up their defensive positions The Wraiths learned that the indigenous species of Endor, the Ewoks and the Yuzzum, were also plagued by the Marauders.
Inspired by the Ewoks and Yuzzums their tenacity in the face of their more advanced enemies, The Wraiths expanded their efforts in the sector to end all illegal Marauder activity (sometimes with the assistance of Sanyassan Marauders who had rejected their culture's predominant habits). Recognizing the need to replace the raid-based economy of the Sanyassans, The Wraiths sponsored a variety of business endeavors on the planet that would provide jobs and encourage the Sanyassans to turn toward a more peaceful lifestyle.
The Wraith's Peace
As prosperity flooded the sector with the formation of a number of highly successful corporations by the Soyak-Ikorn Consortium (later Soyak-Rainer Enterprises) a number of Wraiths began to perceive how fragile that prosperity was. Under Venix Soyak's leadership a number of Wraiths retired from mercenary life and followed House's Soyak-Ikron and Rainer to join with the settlers, the Ewoks, the Yuzzum, and even the Sanyassans to form The Avance Coalition. Applying Wraith values to the new government, they secured the sector for its inhabitants and ensured its ongoing defence.
Released from their duty to protect the peace they had created, The Wraiths went on to be led by Venix's cousin Avid Soyak, and their esprit de corps was undiminished. With their Sabaoth class capital and starfighter ships, the Wraiths need only deploy themselves in a system to see a show of respect, instead of long fighting. The group has hit an all-time high, and only The Wraiths know what the future holds.
With the Wraiths having become a mature organisation with seasoned veterans filling their ranks, they have transitioned to an organization that fights, but fights with the knowledge and experience from so many years in the field. This era of sober thought was ushered in by their now deceased leader Ralgarrch. Their seasoned members make up a War Council that helps its new members complete contracts without stepping into the same pitfalls as previous generations, led now by a Nautolan known both in political circles as well as battle zones, 'The Fish' Zao Nephalem. The War Council is a unique feature The Wraiths have when compared to other mercenaries.
Wraith Rank Structure:
The Hortator, Leader of the Wraiths, supervises the group, delegate’s assignments and is responsible for furthering the operational capabilities and overall success of the Wraiths. Though advised by the War Council the Hortator remains the final authority, the end of the line in the decision making process.
The Legatus, second in command of the Wraiths, assists the Hortator in fulfilling all aspects of their role as well as acting as a replacement for the Hortator in times when the Hortator is unavailable.
The Battle Group commanders, each Archon is responsible for maintaining and advancing the effectiveness of their Battle Group. As the link through which information is passed both ways between the War Council and the Battle Groups, Archons manage missions and handle assignments to all lower levels whilst also representing their member's opinions, wishes or concerns. They are the most trusted and respected members of the Wraiths.
The lowest command rank, Praetor’s have seen much of what the galaxy has to offer and have survived to benefit from that experience. They know what’s required in any situation and ensure that the right resources are brought to bear in the right way. Allowed to pick from both Tribunus ranks to support their own missions, Praetors are usually the senior officers, assisting the Battle Group commanders and the War Council.
- Tribunus Maior
Forged in the furnace of combat the Tribunus Maior are the hardened core of the Wraiths. Tried and tested, these Wraiths have earned the right to pilot the formidable Sabaoth craft. Capable of acting with or without instruction, as individuals or in a group, and using whatever resources they need to get the job done. Highly skilled and experienced, a Tribunus Maior is a match for any in the galaxy; often working alongside the less experienced Tribunus Militum units.
- Tribunus Militum
Having experienced the hardships and battles in the Galaxy, and having proved themselves worthy of being a Wraith, new members are granted the rank of Tribunus Militum, becoming true Wraiths and entering operational duty. Now both capable and fully equipped, regular assignments that will truly test there abilities can be expected from their Battle Group commanders.

"An effective talking point, but I wish he’d waited a bit. It’s silly to roll this out before we know what the actual decision is; why not sit tight instead of offering the other side a soundbite with which they might be able to do something? The quote:
“As you know, the Supreme Court is gonna be dealing with whether or not Obamacare’s constitutional,” said Romney, previewing the court’s decision that is expected to be announced on Thursday.
“If it’s not, if Obamacare is not deemed constitutional, then the first three and a half years of this president’s term will have been wasted on something that has not helped the American people,” said Romney, offering his most scathing review to date of Obama’s tenure should the plan be struck down.
“If it’s not,” Romney went on, “If it is deemed to stand, then I’ll tell you one thing. Then we’ll have to have a president, and I’m that one, that’s gonna get rid of Obamacare.”
If the law is torpedoed, O will have spent valuable time on an unconstitutional project when he could have used it to work on, oh, say, the economy. I like that spin; as BuzzFeed notes, you’re bound to hear lots more of it from Mitt in the weeks ahead if Roberts and Kennedy come through on Thursday. He’s taking Obama’s two biggest liabilities, the anemic economy and the chronic unpopularity of his big legislative “achievement,” and using the Court’s ruling on the latter as an indictment about the former. Well done. My only quibble is that, the first time I watched this, it sounded like he was suggesting that if O-Care is upheld then O did help the American people. Of course he doesn’t mean to; he’s telling you flat out that he’ll repeal the statute if the Court doesn’t do it for him, but in that case, Obama wasted his term no matter what, right? Either we end up with the status quo ante if the law is struck down or we end up with a gigantic boondoggle and a still-stagnant economy if the law is upheld. Curious to see if the DNC will pull that bit about “waste” from this clip if the statute survives on Thursday and stick it in an ad crowing about the Court’s ruling and the “benefits” of the new health-care law.
Anyway. Anyone read or heard about any SCOTUS tea leaves today? We haven’t done nearly enough obsessive over-analysis of Court minutiae as possible “tells” on the biggest decision in decades.",0.9589753150939941,599,1.0437052249908447

Care Instructions for traditional clothes:
- Dry Cleaning: Traditional clothes are often made of delicate fabrics and adorned with intricate embellishments. Dry cleaning is the preferred method for cleaning traditional clothes to ensure their longevity. Take your traditional clothes to a professional dry cleaner who specializes in handling delicate garments.
- Storing: Proper storage is crucial to maintain the quality of your traditional clothes. After dry cleaning, store your traditional clothes in a cotton or muslin garment bag. Avoid using plastic bags as they can trap moisture and lead to mould or mildew. Hang the traditional clothes in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight, to prevent discolouration or fading.
- Folding: If you prefer folding your traditional clothes, ensure it is clean and dry before proceeding. Gently fold the traditional clothes along the pleats, keeping the embellished side on the inside to protect it. Place acid-free tissue paper between the folds to prevent creasing and maintain the shape. Store the folded traditional clothes in a cotton or muslin bag.
- Handling: When handling your traditional clothes, be mindful of the delicate fabrics and embellishments. Avoid pulling or tugging forcefully, as it can damage the stitching or embellishments. Handle the traditional clothes with clean hands to prevent transferring dirt or oils onto the fabric.
- Ironing: If your traditional clothes require ironing, use a low heat setting and place a thin cotton cloth over the traditional clothes before ironing. This will protect the fabric from direct heat and prevent any damage. Avoid ironing over embellishments or delicate embroidery to avoid flattening or melting them.
- Spot Cleaning: In case of minor stains or spills, it's important to act quickly. Use a soft, clean cloth or a cotton swab dipped in a mild detergent diluted with water to gently dab the stained area. Avoid rubbing vigorously, as it can spread the stain or damage the fabric. Always test the cleaning solution on a small, inconspicuous area before applying it to the stain.
- Fragile Embellishments: traditional clothes often feature delicate embellishments such as sequins, beads, or zari work. Handle these areas with extra care, as they can snag or come loose easily. Avoid hanging traditional clothes next to sharp objects or jewellery that may catch on the fabric.
- Perfumes and Deodorants: Avoid spraying perfumes or deodorants directly onto your traditional clothes, as they can stain or discolour the fabric. Apply perfumes or deodorants on your body before wearing traditional clothes to prevent any accidental contact.
- Avoid Moisture and Sunlight: Traditional clothes should be protected from moisture and direct sunlight. Exposure to sunlight can lead to fabric fading or discolouration, while moisture can cause mould, mildew, or damage to the fabric. Store your traditional clothes in a dry place and avoid storing them in areas prone to high humidity.
- Clothing with a digital print or made of cotton should only be washed separately in cold water to prevent colour runs and shrinkage.
By following these care instructions, you can help ensure the longevity and beauty of your traditional clothes, allowing you to enjoy wearing them on multiple occasions.",0.9310179948806763,1649,0.3704776465892792

"Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) has announced a ban on ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence-powered writing tool producing speedy texts or ‘answers’ when prompted, amid fears that students could continue to use it to cheat in examinations and assessments.
In a communique to students following the school’s Student Examinations Disciplinary Committee meeting held late in February 2024, it was noted with concern that a large number of exam irregularities were cheating using mobile phones and electronic devices, and teachers and professors were particularly concerned about the AI chatbot, which is now restricted, and any student found using it will be discontinued from learning.
“Kindly take note that use of auto coding software during an examination such as ChatGPT is a very serious offense under the University Examination Regulations and is punishable by expulsion from the University,” reads part of the memo signed by Dr. Aggrey Wanyama, Registrar of Academic Affairs JKUAT.
ChatGPT makes it far too easy for students to use it as a shortcut for essays or other writing assignments due to its ability to create stunningly human-like responses to a wide range of questions and various writing prompts.
Despite this AI chatbot, released by OpenAI in November 2022, producing quick and easy answers to questions, educators have found fault with it, arguing that it does not build critical thinking and problem-solving skills essential for academic and lifelong success.
JKUAT is the first university in Kenya to ban the software altogether.",0.9678259491920471,320,2.1845688819885254

RECOMMENDED replica bags online BAG SELLERS Updated 2024
These replica bags allow individuals to elevate their fashion game without compromising on quality or style. These asolf replica bags showcase the same impeccable craftsmanship and high-quality materials as the originals. From the timeless Neverfull to the iconic Speedy, Louis Vuitton replica bags are designed to make a statement. They feature the signature LV monogram pattern or other iconic designs that are synonymous with the brand. High-quality designer replica handbags can seriously up your fashion game – you just gotta make sure you’re doing it the right way.
There’s nothing worse than buying dupe designer bags only to realize that people can tell the difference. Our top luxury knock off handbags replication process allows us to get the best quality designers and reverse engineer them. Luxurytastic’s handbags quality are definitely high-quality, and they are really mirror-image replicas of the authentic versions. That’s why we didn’t go for the authentic handbags that would dent our pockets in the first place. With this in mind, spending almost the same amount as you’d an authentic bag on a replica or less famous brand bag is out of the question. I was lucky to learn about Luxurytastic Replicas through Mau-fashion’s review of Luxurytastic.
The Umbra Flapper was also more customizable than any other freestanding rack we tried. Its nine hooks can either stow away so that they’re flush with the trunk of the rack or stay “flapped” open. We found this rack simple to assemble, with only three pieces to attach; others we put together had dozens of parts and a long list of steps. It also comes in a walnut finish with black hooks, a gray finish with gray hooks, and a white finish with white hooks. The Hang-It-All is a historic mid-century design that’s as beautiful as it is functional, with 14 hooks to organize coats, hats, and accessories.
But, I think her pointed remarks were directed to other people like me who admitted buying one. I don’t think my interpretation of Judy’s post was a mistake. “it is that what you are doing is helping destroy humanity”…..pretty strong IMO.
These are smaller than the Whispies and more manageable. They stayed put all day and I have to say, were a lot easier to apply than the other ones I purchased. The LV Neverfull bag still remains on my life-long bucket of things I want—and with 63 knocking on the door in a few weeks, I don’t think it’ll ever belong to me. I have purchased several LV Damier and Monogram items from a site to deal with and very high quality stuff that has been endorsed by others on various rep watch fora. Anyways, my wife has an obsession of her own, which is handbags!
Some of the top replica handbag brands include Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Prada, and Hermes. These brands are known for their high-quality craftsmanship and attention to detail, making them sought-after choices among fashion enthusiasts. With their impeccable replication of the original designs, these wholesale replica handbag brands provide customers with a chance to own a luxurious-looking bag at a fraction of the price. Manufacturers of wholesale replica handbags prioritize quality control measures to ensure the production of high-quality products.
But RepLadies aren’t just here for the quality; the know-how required to navigate the high-end replica market is in itself a kind of currency, one that seems to appeal to even the wealthiest of women. For this cadre of rep obsessives, status isn’t a massive collection of real luxury bags; it’s the ability to find a fake so perfect it feels more theirs than the real thing. RepLadies is a sub-Reddit dedicated to counterfeit luxury goods, and where a community of mostly millennial women gather to acquire them. Exquisite replicas of everything from designer shoes to Rimowa suitcases are available, but the bags are the real attraction. I personally only care about the actual replica bag in and of itself.
You read all the time about travelers being “put off” by people thrusting things at them and harrassing them to buy, yet the only reason they do it is it works. Mr. Liu’s family has been making leather handbags for nearly 20 years. Not many sellers on RL source from his family so he’s not famous. Mr.Liu has business ethics, doesn’t need to be famous, just needs customers to understand the product, domestic customers only want to buy from his family.
If they don’t feel guilty about their boss copping the bag, they wonder about child labor or ethical consumption around fast fashion. We are dedicated to offering high-quality replica Chanel that closely mirror the craftsmanship, design, and elegance of the originals. We prioritize superior materials, attention to detail, and customer satisfaction to provide you with affordable luxury. As one of my friends said “In the Grand Bazaar, the items you see on display are not the good ones.
About 15 years ago, the owner of Yellow Wall and the owner of the God factory were working together. They aspire to create the best LV handbags in the world. The boss of God factory was more successful when he changed the hardware from 208 steel to 316 steel (watch steel) and introduced his products to foreign customers. The owner of Yellow Wall serves domestic customers only.
These picks combine Chanel’s heritage craftsmanship with modern appeal, offering something for every style and occasion. The Saint Laurent Le 5 A 7 collection comes with a cool backstory that adds an extra layer of charm to these iconic bags. If it’s not made by the manufacturer of the brand name on the item then it’s not authentic and not allowed. The factory has sufficient supply of goods and various styles. Metaphorically, of course, there’s literally nothing dark (in my opinion) about being a frugal fashionista and going for knock off purses – if it’s done right, of course. Every replica is guaranteed by oure 100% Satifaction Promise.",0.9567092061042786,1384,0.6982761025428772

Pursuant to a case against the previous outlet store, called CHANEL OUTLET, formerly located online at this site, a Judgment and Injunction of a U.S. District Court held the former owners and operators of the outlet liable for selling replica Chanel products.

This consent is not required to receive services on JustAnswer and may be revoked at any time. I’m not sure I agree that buying $29 fake bags Gucci slides is a form of anti-capitalist protest when you could be spending QC-rubric-making energy on…not buying things at all. But consumerism is a gilded tomb that many feel requires mandatory, constant participation, regardless of the societal risk of being “called out” as a fraud.
Some sellers might replace seized packages with no extra charge, some might reship if you pay half of the original total, and others might offer seizure insurance for an extra fee. They’re not grilling you to catch you buying replicas; they honestly don’t care about that. PayPal can be a risky payment method for replica sellers, which is why not all of them use it. Once you’re satisfied and the order is ready to ship, make sure to send the seller your complete shipping information (recipient, address, city, state, postal code, country, and phone number). Even went into the LV boutique with my replica Pochette Metis from DD. Ever since I met Hannah, I no longer think it’s worth it to “play the Hermes game” to get a Birkin or a Kelly.
Whenever I have questions about bags, she patiently discusses them with me. A good friend of mine was a replica newbie and they helped her with a serious Chanel mission (wedding party) that she was ecstatic about. They charge $30 for shipping, but usually, when I make bulk purchases, they waive the shipping fee. I bought a pair of Gucci sneakers from them, and I even compared them with my authentic ones. My next replica Hermes will be a crocodile Birkin and I’m eyeing the Himalayan. I’d love to get more Horseshoe stamped bags in the future.
The truth is that the factory only has Chanel JBIAA. Lisa, a 38-year-old Manhattan woman, has this superrich friend. She has a massive Birkin collection, a $10 million dollar house in the Hamptons, and flies everywhere in private jets. She gets them at “Tupperware parties” for replica designer bags.
Backpacks offer a trendy and casual option for those on the go. What’s happened is that the shipping agent, not the seller, has created the label for your package. And they’re the ones responsible for sending it out. If you want to order a specific bag, you can send a message directly to the seller.
Hence, you’ll only find the most popular iconic designs here, as explained in may Luxurytastic reviews such as Maria Dipalo’s Luxurytastic review as well. Additionally, don’t be afraid to mix and match replica bags with other accessories such as scarves, belts, or statement jewelry. This clever addition can elevate the overall look and create a bold fashion statement. Lastly, it is crucial to be aware of any return or refund policies offered by the seller. In case you are not satisfied with the replica bag or if it does not meet your expectations, having a clear understanding of the seller’s policies will help ensure a smoother buying process.
Luxurycoveaus.com is a website that has been specializing in selling high-quality replicas for more than 12 years.Our products are very close to the originals and have a long service life. Besides the prices and high quality offered by a replica seller, I’m also very particular about their customer service. If I don’t have the assurance that I’ll get my questions answered or my problems solved, then I’m better off finding another replica seller. I was impressed that this seller has carefully selected its collection of brands and products without going over the top.
From classic ballet flats to chic espadrilles and statement heels, our shoes combine luxury aesthetics with exceptional comfort at an affordable price. We ensure every piece meets the highest standards of quality, offering you the look and feel of authentic Chanel without the high price tag. Shop with confidence, knowing that we stand by our products and your satisfaction. So, we browsed around the shops at the Bazaar and went into the ones that seemed to have decent fake bags items. At some point my boyfriend, who had a clear task set by me, asked in turkish about the “good stuff”. In the first one, the guy who I assume was the shop owner, pulled out his iPad and started showing me pictures of Chanel bags.
This industrial-looking coat rack is the best for holding lots of bulky coats plus extras, and it comes in the widest range of colors we’ve seen. The Mollie Hook’s small frame fits as much gear as racks two or three times the size, and it can squeeze functionality out of spots that would otherwise go unused. The small but mighty coat rack can transform your daily routine, keeping gear accessible and organized, while also offering an opportunity to give your entryway a dose of personality. I even checked with the seller if they had this bag yet, and I got a positive response. Honestly, it’s pretty upsetting because I put a lot of time and effort into this blog.",0.954214870929718,1311,0.4435393512248993
"Kristofer Bauer doesn’t navigate the ever-shifting blue waves of the Pacific Ocean searching for fortune or plunder. He is chasing the thrill of advancing science.
As an undergraduate in the College of Science at Oregon State, Bauer was surrounded by opportunities to do science. He was able to spend a term at the Hatfield Marine Science Center, tag blue and fin whales in Southern California and work in labs led by leaders in marine science.
""Oregon State has a fantastic biology program, and all the skills that I learned from classes, whether it was cellular and molecular biology, or biochemistry, physics, all of those things I use in my day-to-day to some degree"" Bauer said.
Those opportunities drew him to continue his academic journey as a Beav and pursue a Ph.D. in integrative biology. His academic journey has been a combination of flowing with the tide and taking advantage of all the opportunities Oregon State has to offer.
Life and Tides
Hailing from landlocked Colorado, Bauer sought a new experience on the West Coast. As an undergrad he majored in biology with a specialization in marine biology.
After completing his undergraduate degree in 2020, Bauer chose to continue his academic journey at Oregon State, pursuing a Ph.D. in integrative biology. As a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) fellow, Bauer has been studying the evolution of microscopic ocean organisms.
Although his initial interests didn’t lie in studying the evolution of zooplankton, participating in research and fieldwork during his undergraduate years propelled him to continue his academic journey as a Beav.
Out of all the options before him on the pacific coast, Bauer was drawn to Oregon State due to the College's reputation of undergraduate research and hands-on opportunities.
Here, he found himself captivated by how a scientific perspective encourages a deeper understanding of the natural world. And how that perspective allows individuals to perceive details that others without the same scientific training might not notice.
""I don't think many people come to the ocean with a thermometer and stick it in the water to see what the temperature is,"" Bauer said.
As an undergrad he was able to participate in fieldwork by taking BI 450 Marine Biology and Ecology, a course where students stay at Hatfield Marine Science Center for a term and engage in field-work.
""That was a fantastic class because I really just got to be immersed in what I was interested in. And I was surrounded by other people who felt the same way,"" Bauer said.
For Bauer the greatest opportunity he had while in undergrad was the ability to conduct research. At OSU Bauer worked with Professor Bruce Menge on the intertidal zone; that work was the subject of a previous article, which can be found here.
Throughout his undergraduate career, Bauer also volunteered for and worked on several other transformative projects and experiences.
""I don't think many people come to the ocean with a thermometer and stick it in the water to see what the temperature is.""
""Those experiences involved helping tag blue whales, and fin whales in Southern California. I was able to work on multiple boats helping monitor coastal health and productivity on the Oregon coast,"" Bauer said. ""I worked for multiple intertidal ecology labs working between Northern California all the way up through the Newport area doing similar things, looking at Coastal health but from a rocky intertidal perspective.""",0.9763258695602417,704,1.8777539730072021

Interpreting Feather Sightings: A Guide
Seeing feathers in your life can be a deep spiritual experience. It offers insights and messages from the divine. But, figuring out the meaning of these feather signs is a personal journey. Here, we’ll guide you on how to document, recognize, and trust your intuition when understanding feather sightings.
Tips for Documenting Your Feather Finds
When you find a feather, take time to observe and document it. Note the location, time, and any other details that stand out to you. You might want to snap a photo or keep the feather as a reminder. Writing down your experiences can help you spot patterns and understand the messages.
Signs to Look for When You Discover a Feather
- The color of the feather can hold symbolic significance, such as white feathers representing purity and peace, or black feathers signifying protection and mystery.
- The size and type of feather may indicate the specific spiritual message being conveyed, with larger feathers often carrying more profound meaning.
- The circumstances surrounding the feather’s appearance, such as where you found it or what was happening in your life at the time, can provide valuable context.
Trusting Your Intuition When Interpreting Signs
Figuring out feather signs is a personal and intuitive process. Trust your instincts and allow the feather’s message to resonate with you. Be open to the guidance and wisdom these natural signs offer. Let your intuition guide you as you explore the spiritual significance of your feather encounters.
Feathers and Animal Spirit Guides
Feathers hold deep symbolic meaning in connecting with animal spirit guides. These feathered messengers offer valuable insights into the natural world’s wisdom. By understanding the meanings of different spirit animal feathers, we can learn more about ourselves and the universe’s messages.
Identifying Your Spirit Animal through Feathers
The type of bird feather you find can reveal your spirit animal. For instance, a hawk feather might mean your spirit guide is a bird of prey. This symbolizes sharp vision, intuition, and overcoming obstacles. On the other hand, a songbird feather could suggest a spirit animal linked to creativity, joy, and communication.
Birds as Messengers of Wisdom
- Birds are seen as spiritual messengers in many cultures, carrying divine insights and wisdom.
- When a specific bird feather appears, it might be a sign that your spirit animal is trying to share a message with you.
- Observe the bird’s behavior and traits linked to the feather you found. These can offer clues about the guidance or lessons your spirit animal is trying to convey.
Communicating with Animal Spirits
Connecting with animal spirit guides through feathers can be transformative. By being mindful and open-hearted, you can tap into the messages these winged messengers bring. Hold the feather, notice its unique qualities, and reflect on any insights or intuitions that come. This way, you can deepen your dialogue with animal spirits and unlock their wisdom.
Feather Type | Symbolic Meaning | Spiritual Guidance |
Hawk Feather | Vision, Intuition, Insight | Gain clarity, trust your instincts, rise above challenges |
Owl Feather | Wisdom, Discernment, Transformation | Deepen your understanding, see the bigger picture, embrace change |
Dove Feather | Peace, Gentleness, Compassion | Cultivate inner harmony, approach life with tenderness, connect with your true nature |
The Healing Properties of Feathers
Feathers have been valued for their spiritual and healing powers in many cultures. They can clean energy, offer emotional support, and help in personal healing.
Using Feathers in Energy Cleansing
Feathers are used in energy cleansing rituals to remove bad or stuck energies. By sweeping a feather around a room or over the body, one can feel lighter and balanced. This simple act helps make room for positive energies.
Feather Medicine for Emotional Support
The feather meaning is not just physical but also emotional and spiritual. Many find comfort in carrying a special feather. It reminds them of their inner strength and resilience when things get tough.
Personal Healing Journeys with Feathers
Feather rituals are key in the healing practices of many indigenous cultures. People have shared deep emotional and physical healing after finding a feather at a special moment. These feather rituals help connect us to nature and our intuition.
Feather Property | Spiritual Significance | Healing Impact |
Cleansing | Removing negative energies | Restoring balance and harmony |
Emotional Support | Providing comfort and resilience | Enhancing emotional well-being |
Intuitive Guidance | Connecting to inner wisdom | Facilitating personal growth |
Exploring the healing feather meaning can deepen our understanding of ourselves and nature. Through feather rituals and listening to their messages, we can start healing journeys that make our lives richer.
Creating a Feather Altar
Making a feather altar is a meaningful way to honor feathers’ spiritual significance. It lets you create a special space to display and respect feathers. This space helps you connect with the divine messages feathers carry.
Steps to Build Your Feather Altar
Start by picking a quiet spot in your home, like a corner or a special surface. Choose feathers you’ve found or been given. Place them in a way that looks good, giving each feather its own spot.
You can also add natural things like stones, crystals, or dried flowers. These can make your altar even more special.
Items to Include for Spiritual Boost
Include things that mean a lot to you, like candles, incense, a journal, or photos. These items add layers of meaning to your altar. They help make your feather altar a powerful place for your spiritual journey.
Maintaining and Honoring Your Feather Space
It’s important to take care of your feather altar. Clean and rearrange the feathers often. This keeps them looking good and feeling special.
When you get new feathers, add them to your altar. This keeps the flow of divine messages going. Use your altar for meditation or prayer. It can help you grow spiritually and connect with the divine.",0.9162879586219788,3332,2.3898508548736572

"In the vast landscape of international trade, every nation wants to make its mark by contributing unique products to the global market and improving its status. In this intricate idea of commerce, many organizations like the APEDA play a pivotal role. APEDA’s full form is the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority. Such organizations help to grow the business overseas and improve its legal status. Let’s find out how APEDA has fostered the company and played a crucial role in its success throughout the years.
Understanding APEDA’s Mandate
Established in 1985, APEDA operates under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. Its primary objective is to promote the export of scheduled products, which include fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat, poultry, confectionery, and various other processed foods. This is why APEDA’s full form is Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, as it mainly deals in the food and agriculture segment. The authority works as a bridge between Indian exporters and international markets, facilitating a seamless flow of goods. For this, canned food products, raw food products, spices, and other edibles can be transported easily.
Market Access and Development Initiatives
One of APEDA’s key responsibilities is to open doors for Indian products in global markets. Through its market development programs, the authority identifies potential markets where certain edibles can perform optimally. It gives insights about the country’s need for certain resources and where India should reach to target the scarce areas and develop their business accordingly. This assists exporters in navigating the complexities of international trade regulations. This proactive approach by APEDA helps Indian exporters tap into new opportunities, enhancing the visibility and acceptance of Indian products worldwide. Thus giving legal and reliable exposure in the external market.
Facilitating Quality Assurance
In the competitive global marketplace, quality is non-negotiable. APEDA takes a robust stance on ensuring that Indian products meet international quality standards. The authority collaborates with exporters to implement best practices in production, processing, and packaging. Together, they ensure that certain products match the demand market more specifically. By doing so, APEDA not only safeguards the reputation of Indian products but also instils confidence in international buyers by matching the quality standards.
Promoting Research and Development
Innovation is the heartbeat of progress, especially in the dynamic realm of agriculture and processed food. APEDA invests in research and development initiatives to boost the competitiveness of Indian products. By supporting advancements in technology, production techniques, and product diversification, the authority empowers exporters to stay ahead of the curve and meet evolving global demands.
A Green Revolution in Exports
With sustainability emerging as a global priority, APEDA encourages eco-friendly practices among Indian exporters. The authority promotes organic farming and sustainable agriculture, aligning the Indian export sector with the worldwide shift towards responsible and environmentally conscious practices. This has encouraged many businesses to adopt fair and sustainable practices for production and export.
Trade Facilitation and Capacity Building
Navigating the intricacies of international trade requires a clear understanding of regulations, market trends, and logistical challenges. APEDA offers a helping hand to exporters through capacity-building initiatives. Workshops, training programs, and seminars conducted by the authority equip exporters with the knowledge and skills needed to thrive in the competitive global marketplace.
Simplifying Documentation and Compliance
Exporting involves a mountain of paperwork and adherence to international trade regulations. Here, APEDA acts as a guide, simplifying the documentation process and ensuring that exporters comply with the standards set by importing nations. This not only reduces the bureaucratic burden on exporters but also minimizes the risk of trade disruptions due to non-compliance.
Global Networking and Alliances
In the interconnected world of trade, relationships matter. APEDA plays a strategic role in fostering international collaborations and alliances. By participating in trade fairs, exhibitions, and diplomatic initiatives, the authority strengthens the global presence of Indian products. These efforts not only create avenues for increased exports but also position Indian exporters as reliable partners on the worldwide stage.
Diplomacy through Cuisine
Food is a universal language, and APEDA leverages this to build diplomatic ties. Moreover, India is already known for its culinary cuisine and spices, giving countless unique options to foreign countries. Through initiatives like culinary promotions and food festivals, the authority showcases the diversity and richness of Indian cuisine. This not only enhances the global perception of Indian food products but also fosters cultural exchanges that go beyond mere commerce. This has improved the global market for local vendors.
Conclusion: APEDA as the Architect of Export Success
In the grand tapestry of global trade, APEDA emerges as a skilled architect, crafting the framework for the success of Indian exports. Its multifaceted role encompasses market access, quality assurance, research and development, capacity building, and global networking. By doing so, APEDA not only propels the growth of the Indian export sector but also contributes to the country’s image as a reliable and quality-conscious trading partner.
As we navigate the complex currents of international trade, APEDA stands as a route, guiding Indian exporters towards new horizons and ensuring that the world continues to savour the flavours of India.
The common products listed under APEDA are
- Dairy products like milk, cheese, cottage cheese, etc
- Meat and meat products
- Poultry and poultry products like chicken and eggs
- Fruits, vegetables, and related products
- Cereal and cereal products
- Sugar, honey and jaggery
- Biscuits and bakery products and confectionery
- Cocoa-based products and chocolates
- Alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages
- Groundnuts, peanuts, walnuts and dry fruits
- Pickles, papad and chutneys

- Herbal and medicinal plants
However, there is another easier route that can assist such food products to reach overseas. This route is Amazon Global Selling, allowing local vendors to list their products online and expose a market outside the nation. For this, the platform gives exposure with its easy registration process. This ease in registration and mass outreach has opened the doors for many over time. There are still miles to go!",0.9339356422424316,1314,2.1302313804626465
"Rebel Wilson’s best friend has explained how she got together with her girlfriend, Ramona Agruma.
Hugh Sheridan, an Australian singer, said he set the pair up after the actress told him she ‘had never been in love’.
Speaking on The Morning Crew programme on 2Day FM, Sheridan explained how he was ‘determined’ to find his pal a potential suitor.
Find out which co-star Rebel Wilson was ‘harassed by’ below…
He told the radio show: “I was in New York and I had just split up with my ex when Rebel said to me, ‘I can’t imagine how sad you must feel. I’ve never really been in love before’.”
After this, he said he instantly thought of their mutual friend, Arguma.
“I think for a woman that is successful, it takes a strong man to stay with them, but I thought a woman with a woman that’s successful might lift each other up,” he continued. “So I told Rebel later on and they spoke for a week before Rebel came back from Australia to meet her, and they’ve been together ever since.”
It comes after the star took to Instagram to introduce her new partner to fans on June 9.
Alongside a picture of the pair, she penned: “I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince… but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess. #loveislove.”
The post has been liked by over a million people on the platform and several of the actress’s celebrity friends have shared well wishes.
Fellow Pitch Perfect star Anna Kendrick commented: “Love you both like crazy,” and Killing Eve actress Jodie Comer penned: “So much love!”
Although it marked the first time the 42-year-old publically shared a photo with her new partner, it wasn’t the first time they had been spotted together.
Both of them were spotted at the Vanity Fair Oscars party in March, although it’s believed they hadn’t confirmed their relationship then.

"By Osita Chidoka
Days ago, two officers of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) were brutally murdered in the ongoing macabre orgy of violence by the strangely named Unknown Gunmen. Their offence? Lawful discharge of their statutory duty. The FRSC officers do not bear arms, and as such, it is cowardly to shoot unarmed citizens no matter the subject of the agitation. The killings, kidnapping, and enthronement of fear in the southeast must end.
I have written articles about revamping our security architecture, reached out to leaders in the zone and engaged privately with security agencies and youth leaders to help douse the tension. The results are not as encouraging as I hoped. Yet I am still hopeful.
During my talk at The Platform in 2021, I warned against the so-called Unknown Gunmen phenomenon, noting that “you can start it, but you can’t stop it.” That warning was against any form of violent insurrection.
I have consistently defended the right of IPOB to agitate for anything, including secession, provided it is peaceful and within the legitimate right of any Nigerian to associate and promote any agenda freely.
No group in Igboland since NCNC and NPP has mobilised Igbos like IPOB has done. They tapped into a deep well of discontent in the land and used the tactics of the growing nativist nationalism sweeping around the world to gain a following. They created the “they vs us” and, with the thoughtless mismanagement of our national diversity by the government of the day, found a fertile ground. That their message resonated with the people reflects the deep sense of hopelessness in the region.
I was of the opinion, and still believe, that the Nigerian State partly causes the anger in Igboland through sheer incompetence and a post-civil war mentality of containing the Igbos. The more significant source of the anger, however, is the poor and unaccountable leadership in Igboland.
I am of the considered view that IPOB should focus its gaze on the leadership in Igboland, force accountability and elect people capable of using the zone’s resources to build a liveable homeland that embodies the concept of Biafra as a prosperous refuge for Igbo people.
An example I love to give is that the tallest building in Enugu today is the African Continental Bank (ACB) headquarters, built by the Eastern regional government in the late 50s. Sixty years after, with Enugu State receiving more money than Eastern Region in real dollars, the environment has not enabled a building reflecting the hopes and aspirations of the Igbo people. Yet, Ernest Azudialo, an Igbo businessman, built the Nestoil Towers in Victoria Island, Lagos.
Why are Igbo states hostile to private capital? Why is governance in Igboland not reflective of the triple values of uche, uchu, and egwuchukwu that embody Igbo virtues? The problem is not only the marginalisation by the Nigerian state. It is primarily the failure of local governance from Local to State governments across the East.
The resort to forming a Security Network ostensibly to ward off armed herders, who destroy and pillage communities, marked the beginning of a new dimension in the mobilisation that has now been hijacked. It has created opportunities for criminal activities, which is killing the Southeast.
Criminal elements and misguided youths have plunged Igboland into a cycle of violence that, if not checked, will be difficult to contain and lead to the decline of the already poorly governed region.
The world has seen hitherto progressive states decline to almost a Hobbesian state of nature where life is “nasty, brutish, and short.” Afghanistan was once a progressive state. Harare, following Mugabe’s wrong priorities, shot itself in the head. After the collapse of the U.S. car industry, the city of Detroit showed that failure could happen even in a developed country. At home, the once beautiful city of Maiduguri is now a metaphor for devastation. The Southeast is on the path.
The killings must stop. Genuine agitators should step forward and disown the criminality going on. The Federal Government should fast-track Nnamdi Kanu’s trial or promote a negotiated settlement that will demobilise armed groups and return IPOB to the path of peaceful agitation.
There are still many groups promoting the Confederate philosophy in the U.S. after over 100 years of the war of secession. The onus is on the Federal Government to make the union attractive by building that middle ground of national inclusion.
The amnesty offer by Gov Chukwuma Soludo and the Church Leaders is an opportunity. The gunmen should take it. Igboland cannot afford the double jeopardy of poor governance and descent to anarchy. We will be the losers. We can’t bite off our noses to spite our faces. Only “Onye Ala” will burn his yam barn and exclaim with glee that he has dealt with his enemies. Those who are the cynosure of all eyes should not play with ash.
My heartfelt condolences go to the families of those who lost their lives in this senseless orgy of violence. I call on the armed agitators to lay down their arms and seek the path of peace. Now is the time!

"Whether there’s a new addition to the family, an exciting event, or a holiday, capturing beautiful family photos should be at the top of your to-do list.
Although it can be overwhelming to try and squeeze them in if you’re the family or to try new poses if you’re the photographer, these family photo poses will have you smiling for years to come!
Keep reading to discover 11 of the most unique family photo ideas.
1. Piggy Back Rides
It’s something that happens so often in the everyday lives of families but that is very rarely captured! Piggyback rides are ever so sweet and are really a great way to get the whole family warmed up for the rest of the photoshoot.
While posed photos are nice, candid shots can really capture the essence of a family. Have mom or dad lay on their backs holding their child up with their feet and hands in the traditionally fun airplane mode!
This type of shot is a great way to get kids to warm up to you through giggles and a bit of adrenaline as they experience flying.
3. Ring Around the Rosie
If you’re working with camera-shy kids, try having them play a game. Something as simple as ring around the Rosie can liven everyone up. Adding a bit of movement in the shots will add an entirely new life to them as well.
4. Story Time
For a quiet moment, have the parents read sit on the bed and read a book with their little one. You can have everyone lay on their stomachs on the bed while reading and shoot straight on, or have the parents sit on the floor with the kids lay on their stomachs on the bed.
These precious moments are especially beautiful when converted into black and white for a memory that really will be cherished for years to come.
5. Caught in the Moment
If the house that you’re shooting in has an overlook from the floor above, try having the family sit down to read a book or play a board game. This type of action shot can really capture the beauty of the family as they engage together. The good thing about your photo image here is that you can convert photo image using Inpixio jpg to pdf and have all your shot converted to PDF
6. Cooking Together
For a unique in-home shoot, have everyone head to the kitchen and make a batch of cookies. This is the perfect opportunity to capture those moments parents will someday miss, like little hands sneaking up to taste some cookie dough or licking the spoon and getting chocolate on the nose.
Shoot from both the child and the adult’s perspectives and don’t be afraid to tell everyone to get messy! Nothing is quite as cute as a little one all floured up. Just make sure that it’s the last shot of the day.
7. Favorite Toys
Have the parents bring their kid’s favorite toys. Start your shoot off with standard family shots and when a bit of extra encouragement is needed or you’re ready for some more candid shots, bring the toy out. You can shoot only the kid and their toy and then bring in other family members for some magical shots.
8. Jumping on the Bed
For a home shoot, nothing is quite as fun as being told to jump on the bed! The kids will love the chance to get crazy and you’re sure to get some truly beautiful shots. Make sure to have a high shutter speed so there aren’t any blurry toes and so that you can truly capture those precious “in the moment” shots. If you don’t like the background, you can remove it with quitar fondo a una imagen online and replace it with your desired background.
9. Lights at Night
After the sun sets, get the family outside and wrap everyone together in Christmas lights. Make sure to wrap the lights around necks and all the way down to the feet so that no bodyparts disappear in the dark. This will inevitably elicit some giggles from the family so not only will you have a unique shot, but you’ll have some genuine smiles as well.
10. Bring the Pets
Adding the family pets to the shoot is a perfect way to create memories that will last a lifetime. From puppies and kittens to lizards and snakes, family photos are never as unique as when you bring in the furry or reptilian family members.
11. Kids’ Perspective
Try shooting from the perspective of the kids. Have the parents stand facing each other while the kids peek between the legs. Get down on the ground with the kids and shoot straight on.
Bonus: Play With Silhouettes and Shadows
Another fun idea is to play with silhouettes and shadows. When sunset rolls around, have the family stand directly in front of the setting sun so that an outline is created. You can do very sweet kissing and hugging photos with closeups as lips touch foreheads, or you can have a bit more fun and have dad swing the kids around or have them sitting on his shoulders.
You can also try playing with the shadows. This will be most successful when the sun is high in the sky and you have beautifully long shadows. Similarly to the silhouettes, you’ll have the most success with people holding hands but standing relatively far apart so that you can still see each individual.
Create a Photobook
Now that you have so many incredible and unique shots, combine them all into a photobook so that the family can have these memories at your fingertips forever.
There are plenty of software options to design beautiful photobooks. Some work in conjunction with Lightroom and others you will need to learn how to select multiple photos on Mac or PC to drag in your desired shots.

"Tigers’ bleak run ends with defeat
Bangladesh saved their best batting for last but in vain as the Tigers finished their World Cup campaign with an eight-wicket defeat to Australia at the Maharashtra Cricket Stadium in Pune yesterday.
Despite managing their highest score in this edition, 306 for eight, Bangladesh were unable to pressurise their opponents at any point in the chase.
A brilliant unbeaten century from Mitchell Marsh helped the five-time champions pursue the target with ease, with eight wickets in hand, and also provided a lesson for all the frontline Bangladesh batters who failed to stretch their innings after having managed a decent start.
Like yesterday, Bangladesh could not put up a fight in the six defeats which occurred on the trot, with the humiliating 87-run loss against an associate nation like the Netherlands coming as the lowest point.
Bangladesh won at least three matches in each of the last four ODI World Cups, and only two wins this edition indicate that Bangladesh cricket has made little progress over the last two decades.
From the outset, the Tigers' journey in this edition of the flagship event was riddled with turbulence, controversies, questionable tactics and approaches both on and off the field, making it a tournament to forget.
Despite the gloom, Bangladesh managed to salvage something from the dismal campaign as they remain on the verge of qualifying for the 2025 Champions Trophy as the eighth team in the points table. The Tigers, though, are relying on hosts India beating the Netherlands today so that they maintain the eighth spot.
For Australia, the victory means they ended the group stage with a seventh successive win after their campaign for a record-extending sixth men's World Cup title started with two defeats.
Earlier, Towhid Hridoy's 74, his maiden World Cup fifty, was the cornerstone of Bangladesh's innings, which saw all top seven batters score at least 21 runs.
Adam Zampa was the pick of Australia's attack with 2-32 as the leg-spinner became the leading bowler in the tournament with 22 wickets, while Marnus Labuschagne derailed the innings by running out the well-set Najmul Hossain Shanto (45) and Mahmudullah Riyad (32).
In reply, Australia lost Travis Head (10) early in their chase when he played on trying to slog Taskin Ahmed.
Warner plundered runs on an excellent batting pitch before the left-handed opener, following a 52-ball 53, surprisingly chipped Mustafizur Rahman to Shanto at mid-off.
The powerful Marsh, however, pressed on, and there was no looking back for the Aussies against Bangladesh attack which missed captain Shakib Al Hasan due to a broken finger.
Marsh went on to eventually strike his second century of the World Cup to ensure Australia, already guaranteed a last-four clash with South Africa, made light of their target to win with 32 balls remaining.",0.9707289338111877,603,1.0010942220687866
"How Can Education Respond to a Faster World?
The pace of change in our society is currently accelerating. Old concepts of authority and hierarchy have been challenged by the reality of a networked world, and bedrock ideas about what citizens need to know have been overturned by a constant drive to learn anew. For Devin Vodicka, the response to these challenges is both simple and all-encompassing: it is the learner who is constant in the new world, and therefore educators must empower the learner to drive their journey.
In Learner-Centered Leadership, Vodicka offers a deeply researched and urgent blueprint for orienting education around the strengths, interests, and needs of individual learners. He makes a compelling argument for the wisdom in giving students the resources to draw their own learning paths and the power of reimagining schools as centers for the intellectual and social development of lifelong learners prepared for a rapidly changing world. Drawing from theories of the mind, change management, and organizational transformation as well as the author’s own experience leading a school district through change, this book serves as an important guide to creating a learner-centered approach to education.
An inspiring book by a visionary and courageous leader.

"Influencer marketing isn’t only about promoting products that promise happy results. Influencer marketing is about leveraging influencers to increase brand awareness of your products through their social media accounts.
A social media influencer is someone who carries influence over his or her followers on social media. This can be determined by the size of their following, the engagement and the content quality of their social presence.
Here, you will find some helpful tools that we recommend before reaching out to an influencer:
Influencer Outreach Process Tips:
Throughout the process of influencer outreach, it is important to plan ahead.
Step 1: Identify your target audience and create a campaign agreement. Once you identify your target influencers, then brainstorm on your campaign. A campaign outline should include some things like: an image or video rights release agreement so you can share their content.
Step 2: Next, make sure to track your success so you have a better understanding of what there is to improve on.
Step 3: Lastly, it will be more helpful for you and your brand in the long run if you nurture your influencer relationships. Why? Because there is a greater chance your influencers will be excited to work with you again in the future if you establish a strong, long-term relationship with them. Even if you do not have a campaign to run any time soon, checking in with them frequently is always a good idea.
What Can Social Media Influencer Marketing Do For Your Brand?
Brand awareness: One of the biggest takeaways from working with social media influencers is having brand awareness. If the influencers have a large following and are posting on social media all the time, there is going to be more engagement on your brand. This is why it is crucial to identify the influencers who have a large following, but can also relate to your brand as well.
Content generation:If you are working with influencers on different social channels such as Instagram or Facebook, using photos as your content is a huge opportunity. These social media influencers can produce the same type of great image content and also be able to get brand awareness.
Sales and revenue generation: Believe it or not, the people browsing through social media are most likely not looking to purchase anything; however, they are more likely to convert after browsing through their feed. In addition, if there is a coupon offer, it will most likely trigger them to take action. When it comes to sales and revenue generation, we recommend using a larger discount code like 20 or 30 percent. That way people will resonant well enough to take action.
The Use of Influencers Was a Success, However the Brand Itself Wasn’t
Fyre Festival, a supposedly luxurious weekend full of music and entertainment was scheduled to take place in the Bahamas several months ago. The festival claimed to provide “first-class culinary experiences and a luxury atmosphere,” along with performances by G.O.O.D. Music, Major Lazer, Migos and more.
However, when the guests arrived for the opening weekend, they experienced something very different. Some even said it was an experience closer to “Survivor.” The grounds were lacking in promised service, replaced by dirt fields, wet tents and cheap chairs.
On another note, the only successful outcome out of this horrific disaster was the use of Influencers. Fyre Festival created a video that went viral urging people to take a trip they don’t want to miss out on. The festival was mostly promoted by Instagram Influencers including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski. It was a success in terms of promoting their brand to those who have a love for music festivals, but ultimately led to an even bigger disaster for the brand in the long run.
Using influencers as a marketing tool is a great way to grow your brand and establish relationships. Keep in mind; you should always be putting the influencer first. By establishing those meaningful relationships, you will see an ongoing success for all of your clients. Influencer outreach doesn’t just end with securing coverage. Make sure to stay in touch with your social media connections because this is another great way of networking. In fact, influencer marketing can even be more cost effective and more targeted than other forms of advertising such as magazines or television.
Even though influencers will help build your brand awareness, if your product or service is faulty, it will become transparent very quickly. Keep in mind, your influencers aren’t supposed to be what makes your company successful. If your brand is already successful and has good product or services, then the influencer is simply helping get your name out there as a trusted company.",0.961130678653717,966,1.3042117357254028

Another 19 per cent termed AAP's five-year performance as average, which takes the approval rate to 68 per cent. Only 30 per cent rated the performance as poor or worse. LocalCircles conducted a large survey, in which it asked Delhiites about the performance of the AAP government in the past five years. The 11-poll survey received more than 1,10,000 responses from citizens living in various parts of Delhi. Overall, considering all areas like water, power, health, anti-corruption, ease of doing business, air quality, public transportation etc., 21 per cent rated the performance of the Delhi government as excellent, 12 per cent as very good, 16 per cent as good, 19 per cent as average, 18 per cent as poor and 12 per cent as very poor, the survey said. When compared to last year, people saying Delhi government exceeded their expectations saw a meteoric rise from 6 per cent to 49 per cent this year, while people calling the performance below expectations reduced from 63 per cent last year to 30 per cent this year. Overall, 68 per cent citizens this year have been 'okay' or 'happy' with the works done by the Delhi government, LocalCircles said. The first question asked the residents of Delhi about the improvements in water supply in the city. The residents were asked to rate the same on the basis of improvement in availability, billing accuracy and quality. As many as 33 per cent citizens said there has been a significant improvement in the last five years, while 23 per cent said there has been a little improvement. A total of 18 per cent said there has been no improvement in water supply, while 26 per cent said it has become worse. In the poll, 43 per cent Delhiites said that there has been a significant improvement in healthcare services in the last five years, 23 per cent said there has been some improvement while 21 per cent said there has been no improvement. A total of 13 per cent said the situation has become worse. People voted considering some key parameters such as availability, affordability and quality. The Delhi government had allocated 14 per cent of its 2019-20 budget to the healthcare sector, compared to the 5 per cent average of other states. Hospitals have been upgraded and other initiatives like Mohalla Clinics and the government bearing the expenses of emergency accident victims when taken to private hospitals etc. have been appreciated by the residents. The comparison with last year shows that the percentage of people voting for significant improvement has increased from 27 per cent to 43 per cent.

"As the lights in the cramped hotel function room dim, the stage illuminates. The crowd breaks out into a unanimous roar. Middle Kids, Sydney’s rising indie rock and pop group, emerge. First strum of the guitar and the room falls silent. All eyes are fixated on Hannah Joy, lead singer and guitarist. And as she beings to sing ‘Bought It’, first song of the setlist and album, the crowd erupts again.
Middle Kids, an indie / alternative trio, are touring Australia and other parts of the world debuting their newly released LP Lost Friends. The album exudes a roller coaster of emotions demonstrated by bursting sounds and styles that you may initially think don’t fit together on the same album. This fritz of energy carries out on the stage as well.
“Edge of Town”, Middle Kids’ most popular song of the album created a symphony of singing and dancing bodies in the audience. Although it seemed odd for their biggest song to be played mid-set, the uplifting beats and vibrant lights jumping around the room made the crowd forget about the somber nature of the album.
Joy brought us back to a softer reality with “Doing it Right”, a song off of their 2017 EP. A single spotlight shines on Joy as she gives her solo debut on piano. Her melody carries through the room and attaches the audience to her emotional wavelength.
An Onset of Emotions
The crowd favorite was “Mistake”. The energy revived and the audience began to sing, word for word, but this time it felt different. The exactness wasn’t a rote memorization of a perfectly crafted melody. It was visible that the listeners connected to this song. Probably because it tells a story we all know and experience. Eyes were closed and energy was pouring from a room feeling the exact same thing, vulnerability.
Lucky for me my favorite song, “Never Start”, was the encore. Joy got us moving again as the crowd began waving their arms and stomping their feet. By the looks of it it was a sign of a happy crowd and the perfect song to end the evening.
The rough edges and clashing sounds of this album may have some confused. But after getting to witness the album played out in front of me I understood. The vulnerability and emotional collisions on this album are many. Middle Kids have taken a risk to put all of the messiness of the mind on an LP, and in my opinion, it proves successful. Our experiences are often erratic, it’s nice to listen to an album that keeps you on your toes and is masterfully done while not being wrapped up in a pretty bow.

"So far, mediation has only emphasised its intellectual heritage in a one-sided way. It will only become effective when it fully recognises it: admittedly, humanismfreed man from his dependencies, increasing his power to almost immeasurable proportions: Not only the Religion and the Sciences experienced a revolution: man and his knowledge became the sole yardstick. Even the Economy revolutionised itself. Only conflict management did not keep up with the pace. Its revolution is still pending – or has yet to materialise.
In terms of social history, the (Renaissance)Humanismwhich modern sciences and the CapitalismThese were interrelated phenomena that developed together and mutually in early modern Europe (from around 1600) and continue to exert their influence throughout the world today.
This one-sided view of its historical roots in (German-speaking) mediation has its origins in humanistic psychology, which developed at the beginning and middle of the 20th century with reference to existentialist philosophies. In the line of development of A. Maslow, C. Rogers, F. Perls and E. Berne, the human image and methodological reservoir of mediation unfoldseven if borrowings from other directions are increasingly being taken up. Specifically, the focus is on research and pattern recognition of the human being as a free, autonomous, albeit social individual who is morally good at the outset.
While the liberating character is experienced positively, less attention is paid to the subjugating, power-accumulating character of humanistic development history, let alone integrated into the self-image of mediation, even though this would be helpful. In the discussionsThis imprecision and uncertainty can be seen in the question of the influence of mediators. This second part of the articlegives space to the perspective of economic revolutionary capitalism.
Mediation requires not only a forward-looking product to support people and organisations, but also clarity about its own spiritual roots. In times of religious wars, humanism was by no means only aimed at pacifying people among themselvesand provided religious images of human beings for this purposewhich still have an impact today. Humanism also aimed at the material satisfaction of man, the domination of all life, including one's own. This materialism is by no means superficial, but has dazzling and seductive elements, fade-outs and devaluations that primarily affect non-human life and the environment. If we look at the things we conceive, invent, create and endure in the context of humanistic development, we must realise that we not only lose ourselves in them, but also find ourselves in them.Simple causal chains do not help us to understand human development. This explicitly concerns the development of war and peace, conflict and consensus and is therefore interesting for mediation. It is true, for example, that peace makes it possible to do business together peacefully. It is equally true that doing business together secures, if not creates, peace. To name just one example. The question seems to arise again as to whether peace among people is the goal programme, the end of humanism, or rather the means to achieve something else: Accumulation of human power and domination of all other life in the world and beyond.
What does this mean for mediation, the mediation of social conflicts? In a humanistic context, mediation must be aware of these trace elements of its own development history in order to be effective. These individual aspects are outlined below or - for reasons of space - listed in tabular form.
1. when flowers (do their mischief)
It seems an irony of history that mediation wanted to enlarge the cake, but rejected the capitalist legacy outright. Today, the propagated opportunities for growth in conflict are understood in idealistic, emotional and relationship-orientated termsbut only very rarely explicitly in material terms. Instead of making the cake bigger for everyone, it is enough to grow emotionally and interpersonally. This one-sidedness has its counterpart in the overemphasis on the mediator's mediative stance. As a kind of ""inner existence"", it is a typical expression of the humanistic construction of the world and leads to the fact that it is good all round, hardly open to criticism, but in the context of organised mediation leads to a discourse on attitudes; at worst to a dictatorship of attitudes to which the individual is defencelessly exposed. Attitude remains a seductive concept. For the individual, it is tangible, real and a yardstick for decisions, but in the group it is a pushing and oppressive concept, binding and oppressive at the same time. Its social pressure creates conformity, not originality. This may not justify criticism, but it does suggest a group dynamic.
From this flowering of mediation, it is important to get to the ""roots of mediation""to penetrate. They are more influential for the further development of mediation anyway. However, just as mediators can confirm that people lose sight of the essentials in conflict and usually react too violently to what is bad (about the other person), it is also worth slowing down here in order to recognise what mediation is and what is at work in its depths.
2. change of perspective: discovering the future
Capitalism is generally not considered (morally) good in humanist circles, whereas humans are, which is why the two are contradictory. It is capitalism that incites human greed, and therefore also inhuman behaviour; it awakens the worst human instincts and destroys interpersonal relationships. This view may have its logic, but it fails to recognise historical facts. Human greed is thousands of years older than capitalism – and humans, Homo sapiens, have not behaved better towards other human species or other animals without capitalism.Even among their own kind, people without capitalism have communicated far more bloodthirstily than they have done business together. Globalisation bears eloquent witness to this. In fact, Homo Sapiens became friendlier, or at least more peaceful, when capitalism began to spread.And it is no coincidence that this happened largely in the same place, in Europe. It was here that the conditions necessary for capitalism were created: First and foremost, the revolutionary view of the future.
Until the 16th century, the future was something that belonged to God and was predetermined by him. Worrying about the future? For God's sake, no! Rather, it was appropriate to worry about God's favour. The future was not within man's sphere of influence. But in the decades of (Renaissance) humanism, early capitalism developed hand in hand with modern science- and the future was discovered as a human endeavour. The future increasingly appeared to be something that could be shaped. People and societies realised that it was worth investing in it, no longer hoarding their money (like the church) or squandering it (like the nobility), but betting on the future, developing ideas today, inventing things, building devices that would yield profits in the future – but simply did not yet exist today. People began to make the future.
a. Win-win or those left behind are not always losers
And money became capital. Money was invested in the present for a better future. It enabled inventions, the creation of something new, which in turn would generate more money. Money as capital set the cycle of growth in motion – and the cake grew bigger for everyone. In 1500, the annual production per capita for the approximately 424 million people was 550 dollars. Today, the value for the more than 6 billion people on earth is 8800 dollars per capita. It was first and foremost a (second) revolution in agriculture that fed this number of people on earth, which was unthinkable a hundred years ago, but also a successful revolution in the capitalist economy as a whole. Of course, these developments cannot be attributed to capitalism alone, and modern science, the development of the state, the medical and hygienic revolutions and the overall decline in violence have all played their part. However, the original idea, formulated by Adam Smith, that the economic profit of the individual, reinvested in production, also benefits others and thus society as a whole, stands at the beginning of this Europeancharacterised by global development.
b. Economy 3.0 – The end of a zero-sum game
After humans were increasingly less nomadic hunter-gatherers (economies 1.0) and became sedentary farmers during the Neolithic Revolution (approx. 12,000 years ago, economies 2.0)for thousands of years, until around the 15th and 16th centuries, they were the Economy as a zero-sum game operatedWhat some had, others could not have. And those who were rich were rich at the expense of others. And those who were poor could borrow money, but such loans only alleviated hardship or, in the worst case, prevented death. These were by no means loans that were used to create something truly new, the profits of which then allowed the loan to be repaid. Accordingly, the interest on the loan had to be paid from the substance, not from the increase in value. In this world of scarcity, where economic activity was a zero-sum game, wealth must have been frowned upon.It could only be anti-social, at the expense of others. It was not until the emergence of industrial capitalism that money became capital and the economy began to grow.In conjunction with modern science, the future was tackled in order to free people from their dependencies and gain unspeakable power over life. Even if we do not yet know the end of this story, it is clear that the transformation from the stagnating economy 2.0 to the growth economy 3.0 was an astonishing cultural achievement by the people and organisations involved, who used their money as capital and led the economy to ever new increases in value.
In an economy that is growing, the nature of money, credit, interest and profits changes completely! Loans are no longer there to avert the most bitter hardship, but to make production more efficient and to invest in new products. Interest and profits are no longer paid from the substance, but from the growth of the economy. Capitalism has heralded an astonishing, one of the greatest changes of perspective in human history; it has turned the zero-sum game of the economy into a win-win situation for everyone.
c. Reality-building expectations: The cake enlargement
How did this change in perspective come about? The fact that expectations have a reality-forming effect is not only a realisation that has been theoretically substantiated by psychology, but is also an experience of economic life. In 1938, the economist J.M. Keynes explicitly formulated this in his General Theory: ""A monetary economy is,..., an economy in which changing views about the future are able to influence the amount of labour activity.""However, we humans do not move in a vacuum or in mental castles in the air. The changed view that the future could be shaped by people not only leads to an increase in the size of the cake: we also become more insecure. We can fail. If the future is up to us, failure becomes conceivable. This is the basis of a new insecurity and fear. Even historical enlightenment, which claims that the future was never in God's hands but depended on chance and other factors, does not lead to stabilisation. On the contrary, historical research shows that although it is able to enlighten us (intellectually), it also has an unsettling effect emotionally. The more we seem to know about the past, the more intensely we become aware of its multifaceted power.Things can always turn out differently! That is not a reassuring slogan. Any linearity that provides stability dissolves.
3. confidence and optimism: we can do it. Let's just do it!
Uncertainty demands trust, concerns optimism. If everything is in flux, little remains fixed. Capitalists, if not blessed with trust in other people, are at heart the optimists of life. They rush into the present with wealth they don't have (credit, investments) because they believe they can repay their debts. And as far as they have money, they invest it, always at risk, instead of hiding it in a piggy bank under their pillow. Let others do such stupid things, everyone thinks. This optimism is not only contagious in everyday life, but also leads to measurable economic, health, emotional and social benefits.
What are the consequences for conflict mediation in the 21st century? In an economically and socially globalised world whose wealth stems from capitalist economies, conflicts are increasingly recognised for what they are: Occasions to renegotiate the future together and to dare to take new risks, new commitments and obligations.
Understanding the future as a malleable reality, no longer seeing the handling of conflicts as a zero-sum game, but increasingly endeavouring to cultivate other expectations, perceiving the potential of a win-win situation and investing together with optimism and trust – is also at the heart of mediation. For this to succeed, it is worth remembering the intellectual-historical roots of early capitalism, which already implemented a corresponding programme in the field of joint economic activity. For this reason, the goal of increasing the size of the material cake should not be rashly sacrificed by claiming that it is about inner, emotional growth and that common peace is the only goal. No, peace is – just like in business - a means to enlarge the cake and conflict is often the reason to finally get something baked together.

"Diabetes, whenever this word strikes into the mind people mostly assume it with something that is deficiency which near-almost right. But, what is diabetes actually? It is all related with the most important organ in our body i.e. pancreas. We can say a person is troubled with diabetes if only if the body is not able to produce or respond to the insulin hormone. Diabetes can lead to heart attack, kidney related issues, limb amputation, anxiety, depression, stroke and blindness. So, it can get severe if not taken care of.
Currently, there is no proper cure for diabetes but you can live an enjoyable life by maintaining the standard blood sugar level. Meanwhile one of the method—Artificial Pancreas, has arrived in the markets for proper intake of insulin in the body. But you must consider certain things about this artificial pancreas prior to purchase.
No it’s Not an Organ
Pancreas produces and releases an enzyme, insulin—this hormone helps to extract sugar from the food and use it to produce energy in the cells. Not to get confused the so-called artificial pancreas with an actual organ, it might share the same name and functions but it is actually referring to the Medtronic’s MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system. Pancreas of people with type 1 diabetes are not able to produce insulin for the body hence, this technology helps provide the required insulin dose as per its blood sugar level. It is integrated with certain different systems which monitor as well as regulate the dosages.
First of All it’s No Insulin Pump
You might know insulin pumps to reduce the effects of diabetes in the body. But there are certain times when these pumps becomes fatal if consumed too much. Excess intake can lead to hypoglycaemia which can be deadly for the body so, the balancing act must be taken care of.
Even though these devices do allow us to program it for the release of right amount at specific time, you have to frequently check blood sugar level. With insulin you have to be very conscious about the blood sugar level and the intake you are taking. Whereas, Medtronic’s MiniMed 670G also referred as artificial pancreas combines with an insulin pump but with an adjacent glucose monitor which not only checks the blood sugar but also adjusts your insulin dose as per required.
50 Years of Research yet Drawbacks
The researchers have been developing this type of tech from many years. According to the reports, with the approval of MiniMed 670G, it was sort of bomb-drop on various research institutes as it is not full-proof. It won’t be useful for the people with low hearing and vision problems, pregnant women, and people with kidney diseases. Yet, it is sort of a major achievement in medical science and also in pharmaceuticals. Besides, this conceptual tech holds more promising aspects than others methods for the blood sugar management.
A published research in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that no patients with severe hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis are been found after the use of this device. Moreover the device is helping people to maintain their target blood sugar range 73.4% of the time. Although with the absence this system, patients were only able to stay in the range of 67.8% most of the time.
In future, there is strong possibility of getting more upgraded versions of this technology that we can totally rely on. Technology disruption is imminent, each and every technology go through technological disruption anyhow. With every second passing the medical science is surprising us with its fascinating integration with technology like researchers discovered the new shape which is used to hold cells together. Hopefully, we might be seeing the health sector at a whole new level.

"It breaks our hearts to listen to stories on the news of vulnerable older adults who’ve suffered senior citizen abuse and neglect, and maybe it seems as though it’s something which happens to “somebody else” – definitely never to our own family members. However, nearly five million seniors within the U.S. are the subject of some type of elder abuse annually – and, many of these incidents more often than not go unreported, according to The Elder Justice Roadmap report released by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services.
The report also exposes that, sadly, elder abuse most often happens at the hands of a family member or close friend – an individual the older person knows and trusts. Whether the reason is financial gain, stress, or another trigger, it’s essential for each one of us to acknowledge the signs of older adult abuse and then to take steps to prevent it.
Elder Abuse Warning Signs
The National Center on Elder Abuse has put together a fact sheet to shed light on the signs of abuse or neglect in older adults. Abuse may be financial, emotional or physical. Look out for any of the following in your older loved ones, and document any suspected abuse and neglect without delay to your local Adult Protective Services agency. Contact information is provided by state at the National Adult Protective Services Association website.
- Unmet personal hygiene, nutrition, or hydration needs
- Untreated health problems
- Hazardous or unhealthy living conditions
- Unusual changes in behavior
- Isolation and/or lack of supervision by primary caregiver
- Bruises, fractures, cuts, burns, etc. without an adequate explanation
- Combative, demeaning, or controlling behavior shown by primary caregiver
Elder Abuse Prevention
The easiest method to ensure older adults remain safe from any type of abuse or neglect is by remaining aware, alert, and attentive. Check in with elderly loved ones frequently, and have a network of support in place to make certain seniors have lots of opportunity for socialization and stimulating activities, to avoid isolation – one of several important aspects that boost an older adult’s chances for abuse or neglect.
It is possible to proactively anticipate the inherent causes of elder abuse. As an example, recognize if a family caregiver is experiencing undue stress, and come up with an alternative care plan for your senior loved one; and make sure there is no financial motivation in a family member’s wish to serve as caregiver.

"Scotland’s Rustic Bothies Receive a Contemporary Update
In Scotland, which is blessed with exceptionally picturesque and unpopulated landscapes, it is common for backpackers to head to the hills to relax. The more ambitious and experienced among them may choose to break up longer hikes with an overnight stay in basic bunkhouses called bothies. There are more than 90 bothies dotted across the country’s most scenic spots and their remote locations—some can only be reached by hiking for several hours—mean isolation is almost guaranteed.
Recently, some landowners and accommodation providers have begun developing their own small buildings influenced by the bothy experience. These huts and cabins are designed to promote slow living and the joys of reconnecting with nature. Some stick to the principle of providing only the most basic amenities—think composting toilets, wood burners for heating and cooking, and don’t even ask about Wi-Fi—while others adopt a “rough luxury” approach, with guests able to access wood-fired hot tubs, paddle boards, and pizza ovens.
The trend for slow living and escapism also has heightened interest in architecture that transforms back-to-basics living into a five-star experience. Here are some of the finest examples of modern bothies and cabins that offer a soothing take on the experience of self-isolating.
Sweeney’s Bothy, Isle of Eigg
The Bothy Project is an initiative set up by artist Bobby Niven and architect Iain MacLeod to provide basic accommodation for artist residencies in remote locations. Sweeney’s Bothy on the Isle of Eigg off Scotland’s west coast is used by artists for half the year and rented out for the remaining months to help fund the non-profit organization. The cleverly designed cabin features a mezzanine bed suspended above a compact kitchen and reading nook. The rest of the space is for living and working and is fronted by full-height windows. Without doubt, the main draw is the epic view of the Atlantic Ocean and the nearby Isle of Rùm.
Visitors to Inverlonan’s two loch-side bothies can expect an experience centered around “rough luxury” and “slow living.” The simple, gabled buildings (designed by the Bothy Project’s Niven and MacLeod) reference the shapes and material palette of vernacular buildings found throughout Scotland. Their pared-back interiors feature natural furnishings, fabrics, and a wood-burning stove for cooking and heating the space. The bothies nestle between ancient oak trees and open onto private decks overlooking the tranquil waters of Loch Nell. Guests can swim, paddle board, or kayak on the loch before warming up by their own fire pit and cooking their meals using a selection of locally sourced produce.
The Woodman’s Hut goes for an all-out rustic aesthetic to match its peaceful forest setting in the Cairngorms National Park. Entirely off-grid and nestled in a clearing surrounded by Scots pine trees, the cabin features a Hebridean-style box bed, wood burner and vintage furniture. A composting toilet, rainwater shower and the absence of electricity contribute to the back-to-basics experience. Luxury extras are available, however, in the form of a wood-fired hot tub and infra-red sauna. Perhaps the greatest luxury, though, is being reminded of your seclusion whilst lying in bed by staring up at the stars through a carefully placed skylight.
Wildland Bothies by GRAS
Edinburgh architecture firm GRAS is working with conservation and hospitality organization Wildland on a proposal for a group of remote, off-grid bothies dotted across an area near Loch Hope in the far north of Scotland. The idea is to allow guests to spend several days exploring the surrounding scenery, using their individual bothy as a base. The monolithic structures are designed to complement the rugged landscape by evoking giant boulders. Inside, a rich and warm palette of locally sourced materials will create a hygge vibe, helping weary walkers to unwind after a hard day in the hills.",0.9482391476631165,876,1.784594178199768
"Recent research by Bidisha Chakrabarty, Michael Hyman, and Gopal V. Krishnan has shed light on how auditors react to non-financial misconduct within corporations. Their study, published in the International Journal of Auditing, utilizes a novel database to track penalties from federal, state, and local agencies for violations not directly related to financial reporting.
The findings reveal that firms with non-financial misconduct pay approximately 6% more in audit fees, averaging about $162,000 more than their counterparts without such violations. This increase in fees is indicative of the heightened audit risks and the need for more thorough scrutiny by auditors when non-financial misconduct is evident.
Additionally, the study finds that companies fined for non-financial misconduct are more likely to receive „going concern opinions,“ which suggest potential doubts about the firm’s ability to continue operating in the foreseeable future. This correlation underscores the serious implications of non-financial misconduct on a firm’s overall health and sustainability.
The research highlights that non-financial misconduct can signal deeper issues within a firm, such as a lax corporate culture or poor „tone at the top,“ which in turn affects how auditors assess risk and determine audit fees. The robust analysis, including propensity score matching and falsification tests, confirms the impact of non-financial misconduct on audit outcomes.
This study contributes significantly to our understanding of the broader economic impact of non-financial violations, demonstrating that the consequences extend beyond immediate penalties and affect audit practices and perceptions of financial health. It’s a stark reminder for firms to maintain high ethical standards across all areas of operation, not just those directly tied to financial reporting.",0.9290077090263367,342,1.9928297996520996

"Have you ever seen areas that become boring after renovation? They added a new steel railing, changed some of the concrete, or even changed the whole area but it still looks dull. Well, that happens A LOT. Renovation is usually done to enhance the usability of the area, improve the looks, or even resolve the damage of that area.
If you are going to be in charge of something like that, do not forget to liven up the boring corners!
A simple addition of planter boxes can enhance the series of railings and concrete. Take this project as an example. IOTA’s Granite Trough was added to Greenway Supa Centre and took care of the greenification needed.
The planters do not only serve as the container for the much-needed foliage but also acts as a barrier separating the busy area from the open space.
Here’s another great way to add some greens in a dull parking lot in Bankstown. The parking lot looks so modern with all the asphalt and concrete used, not to mention the steel railings. Trough planters are suitable for lining up along walls and railings to help direct traffic.
Granite Tapers were also positioned at specific junctures to emphasize a turn and serve as a guide for vehicles. Granite, being a naturally tough stone, makes these planters a good fit for such landscapes.
An attractive makeover was also provided when Canterbury City Council chooses Granite Trough 1000 planters to enhance the look of their city streets. It doesn’t just add some natural greens in the urban area, it also provides a great barrier between the pedestrian and the traffic.
As you can see, all of the projects happened in an urban area where pavements, steel railings, buildings, or concrete are dull to be left without any natural greens. Adding plants in planters on modern landscapes is a great way to improve the aesthetic value of an area. It makes the whole place livelier without making the plants look ‘out of place’. Planters make the foliage look like it belongs there.

"The Evolving Desires of Men What They Want at Different Stages
Men, like women, are not static beings. Their desires, needs, and priorities evolve throughout their lives. These changes are shaped by factors like age, life experiences, personal growth, and the stage of their relationships. In the early stages of dating, a man might be drawn to excitement and novelty. As the relationship deepens, emotional connection and shared values take center stage. And in marriage, the focus shifts towards building a family, creating a home, and nurturing a lasting bond.
Table of Contents
Why Understanding the Stages Matters for Relationship Success
In the Islamic context, marriage is not just a social contract but a spiritual journey of companionship and growth. Understanding the changing needs of your partner at different stages is crucial for fostering a healthy and fulfilling relationship. By recognizing and adapting to these shifts, couples can strengthen their bond, deepen their connection, and ultimately create a marriage that thrives under the blessings of Allah (SWT).
This knowledge empowers you to:
- Communicate Effectively: Knowing what your partner values at a given stage enables you to address their needs and desires more effectively.
- Avoid Misunderstandings: Recognizing the natural evolution of priorities helps prevent conflicts and misinterpretations.
- Build a Stronger Bond: Tailoring your actions and communication to your partner’s current needs fosters a sense of understanding and deepens your connection.
- Nurture a Lasting Marriage: Adapting to the changes in your relationship ensures that your marriage remains vibrant and fulfilling throughout the years.
The Early Dating Phase: Fun and Exploration
In the early stages of dating, the focus is often on getting to know each other and having a good time. It’s a period of discovery, excitement, and the possibility of something beautiful blossoming.
What Men Want When They’re Just Starting to Date You
From an Islamic perspective, the initial stages of dating are about seeking halal (permissible) ways to get to know someone and assess compatibility. Men, like women, are looking for:
- Genuine Connection: Authenticity is key. Men are drawn to women who are comfortable in their own skin, express themselves openly, and share their values.
- Mutual Respect: Respectful behavior and conversation are essential. This involves listening attentively, valuing each other’s opinions, and avoiding judgment.
- Positive Energy: A cheerful and optimistic attitude can be infectious. Men are attracted to women who bring joy and positivity to their lives.
- Modesty and Decorum: Islamic values emphasize modesty in dress and behavior. This doesn’t mean being dull – a woman can be both modest and incredibly engaging!
The Thrill of the Chase: Excitement and Novelty
The early stages of dating often involve a sense of excitement and novelty. Men may enjoy the anticipation of each interaction, the butterflies in their stomach, and the joy of discovering new things about their potential partner.
- Shared Interests: Finding common ground in hobbies, activities, or intellectual pursuits can create a strong foundation for a deeper connection.
- Respectful Courtship: In Islam, courtship is encouraged as a way to learn about each other’s character and compatibility within halal boundaries.
Lighthearted Connection: Keeping it Casual and Fun
While men may be open to exploring a deeper connection, they often prefer to keep things lighthearted and fun in the initial stages. This allows for a more relaxed environment to assess compatibility without pressure.
- Shared Activities: Going on dates that involve shared interests or activities (museums, walks in nature, etc.) can create fun memories and foster connection.
- Respectful Communication: Open and honest communication, even within the casual dating phase, helps establish a sense of trust and understanding.
The early stages of dating are a time for exploration and discovery. By focusing on genuine connection, mutual respect, and having fun together, you can create a positive and meaningful experience within the boundaries of Islamic values.
The Getting Serious Stage: Building Deeper Connection
As the initial excitement of dating settles, the relationship enters a phase where deeper connections are forged. It’s a time for both partners to assess if they’re truly compatible beyond the surface level and if their relationship has the potential for long-term commitment.
Shifting Priorities: Looking Beyond the Superficial
In this stage, men begin to prioritize qualities that go beyond physical attraction. They become more interested in a woman’s inner world – her values, beliefs, and overall character. This shift aligns with Islamic teachings, which emphasize the importance of choosing a spouse based on piety and good character rather than solely on external appearance.
Emotional Intimacy: Openness and Vulnerability
Emotional intimacy becomes a crucial factor. Men yearn for a partner who can openly express her feelings, creating a safe space for vulnerability and trust. This open communication fosters a deeper understanding and connection between partners, as they learn to share their joys, sorrows, and fears with each other.
Shared Values and Interests: Finding Common Ground
Shared values and interests play a significant role in the long-term success of a relationship. In Islam, compatibility in faith is considered essential. However, finding common ground in other areas of life, such as hobbies, ambitions, and outlook on life, also contributes to a strong and lasting bond.
In this stage, couples might:
- Engage in deeper conversations: Discussing their dreams, aspirations, and fears.
- Explore shared activities: Discovering hobbies and interests they can enjoy together.
- Discuss their faith and values: Ensuring alignment on core beliefs and principles.
- Spend time with each other’s families: Understanding and appreciating each other’s backgrounds.
By cultivating emotional intimacy and aligning their values, couples can build a solid foundation for a lasting and meaningful relationship. This is a crucial step towards a potential marriage that is not only based on love and attraction but also on mutual respect, understanding, and shared goals.
The Pre-Marriage Phase: Testing the Waters
In the Islamic tradition, the period leading up to marriage is a crucial time for both partners to assess compatibility, strengthen their bond, and establish a shared vision for their future together.
The Importance of Compatibility and Shared Vision
Islam encourages couples to seek compatibility in faith, values, and life goals. This period offers an opportunity for deep conversations about:
- Religious Practice: Do you share similar levels of religious commitment and observance? How will you raise children in your faith?
- Values & Life Goals: What are your aspirations for your career, family life, and personal growth? Do your goals align?
- Communication Style: How do you handle disagreements? Can you communicate openly and respectfully?
- Financial Expectations: What are your views on managing finances and shared resources?
- Lifestyle Choices: Do you have compatible lifestyles (hobbies, social activities, etc.)?
By openly discussing these topics, couples can assess whether their values and visions for the future are truly aligned.
Future Goals and Aspirations: Building a Life Together
In Islam, marriage is seen as a partnership where both spouses work together to build a fulfilling life. This stage involves discussing:
- Marriage Expectations: What kind of marriage do you envision? How will you support each other’s dreams and aspirations?
- Family Planning: Do you want children? If so, how many and when? How will you approach parenting?
- Career Ambitions: How will you support each other’s careers while maintaining a healthy work-life balance?
- Shared Responsibilities: How will you divide household chores and financial responsibilities?
By openly discussing these topics, couples can begin to lay the groundwork for a successful and harmonious marriage.

The Role of Family and Friends: Seeking Approval
In Islam, seeking the blessings and approval of both families is considered essential for a blessed marriage. This is a time for couples to introduce each other to their respective families, seek their guidance, and build strong relationships with future in-laws.
It’s also an opportunity to seek advice from trusted friends and mentors who can offer valuable insights and support during this important phase.
Fatima and Ali were deeply in love, but before committing to marriage, they took the time to discuss their future together. They talked about their religious practices, their career goals, and their desires for family life. They also sought the blessings of their families, who offered valuable advice and support. By openly communicating and seeking guidance, Fatima and Ali felt confident in their decision to move forward with marriage, knowing they were building a strong foundation for their future.
Navigating the Pre-Marriage Phase
While this phase is filled with excitement, it’s also important to approach it with honesty, patience, and an open heart. By prioritizing communication, understanding, and seeking guidance, couples can ensure that they are making an informed and thoughtful decision about their future together.
The Honeymoon Phase: Passion and New Beginnings
The honeymoon phase is a beautiful time of transition, filled with excitement, anticipation, and the blossoming of a new chapter in a couple’s life. In Islam, marriage is a sacred bond, and the honeymoon period marks the beginning of this blessed journey together.
The Excitement of Starting a Life Together
The early days of marriage are often characterized by a heightened sense of love and passion. Couples are filled with excitement as they embark on this new adventure, exploring their roles as husband and wife. This is a time to create lasting memories, establish traditions, and deepen their connection.
Physical and Emotional Intimacy Deepens
Intimacy takes on a new dimension during the honeymoon phase. Physical intimacy becomes a beautiful expression of love and commitment, sanctioned and celebrated within the bounds of marriage. Emotional intimacy also deepens as couples share their dreams, vulnerabilities, and joys. This is a period of mutual discovery and growth, as they learn to navigate each other’s emotions and build trust.
Navigating Shared Responsibilities and Decision-Making
As couples begin their married life, they encounter shared responsibilities and decision-making for the first time. This includes managing finances, household chores, and potentially planning for children. Islamic teachings emphasize cooperation, consultation (Shura), and mutual respect in these matters. By establishing open communication and a willingness to compromise, couples can navigate these challenges and strengthen their bond as a team.
Newlyweds Aisha and Hassan were eager to start their life together. They created a weekly date night tradition, exploring new restaurants and activities, and made time for deep conversations about their dreams and aspirations. They also established a system for sharing household chores and financial responsibilities, ensuring a fair and balanced approach. This commitment to communication and mutual support allowed them to navigate the early challenges of marriage with grace and understanding, building a strong foundation for their future.
Embrace the Journey
The honeymoon phase is a unique and precious time in a marriage. By embracing the excitement, deepening their intimacy, and learning to navigate shared responsibilities together, couples can build a strong and fulfilling partnership that is rooted in Islamic values and guided by Allah’s (SWT) blessings.
The Settled-In Stage: Comfort and Security
As the initial excitement of marriage matures, couples transition into a phase of deeper comfort and security. This stage is characterized by a sense of belonging, shared routines, and a profound trust in each other. In Islam, this stage is an opportunity to strengthen the marital bond and create a loving home environment that reflects Islamic values.
Building a Strong Foundation: Trust and Loyalty
Trust and loyalty are the cornerstones of a lasting marriage. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) emphasized the importance of these qualities, saying, “The best of you are those who are best to their wives.”
In the settled-in stage, couples solidify their commitment through:
- Open Communication: Honest and transparent conversations about feelings, needs, and expectations.
- Mutual Respect: Valuing each other’s opinions, even during disagreements.
- Keeping Promises: Following through on commitments, both big and small.
- Forgiveness: Offering forgiveness and seeking forgiveness when mistakes are made.
Shared Routines and Traditions: Creating a Home
Creating a home that is both comforting and spiritually enriching is a key aspect of this stage. Couples can nurture their bond by:
- Establishing Shared Rituals: Praying together, sharing meals, and creating special traditions unique to their family.
- Maintaining a Clean and Organized Home: In Islam, cleanliness is considered a part of faith. A tidy and well-maintained home promotes a sense of tranquility and peace.
- Hospitality: Welcoming guests into your home and sharing meals with family and friends fosters community and strengthens relationships.
Maintaining the Spark: Keeping the Romance Alive
Comfort and security don’t mean sacrificing romance. Islam encourages couples to maintain a loving and affectionate relationship even after years of marriage.
Keep the spark alive by:
- Expressing Gratitude: Regularly express your love and appreciation for each other.
- Small Gestures: Surprise each other with thoughtful gifts, notes, or acts of kindness.
- Date Nights: Schedule regular time for dates, even if it’s just a quiet evening at home.
- Physical Intimacy: Prioritize intimate moments to keep the passion alive.
Fatima and Ali have been married for ten years. They’ve established a comfortable routine, with shared prayer times, family dinners, and Friday nights dedicated to game nights. They also prioritize date nights and small surprises for each other, ensuring their love remains vibrant and joyful. Their commitment to faith, open communication, and appreciation for each other has created a strong and loving home.
The settled-in stage of marriage is a beautiful time of growth, comfort, and security. By nurturing trust, building shared routines, and maintaining a spark of romance, couples can deepen their love and create a lasting bond that reflects the beauty of Islamic marriage.
The Parenting Phase: New Challenges and Rewards
The arrival of children brings immense joy, blessings, and a whole new dimension to a marriage. It’s a time of tremendous growth and learning, but also one filled with new challenges and adjustments.
Adapting to Parenthood: Shifting Dynamics
The transition to parenthood can shift the dynamics of a couple’s relationship. Priorities change, sleep becomes a luxury, and individual needs often take a backseat to the needs of the new little human. It’s essential for couples to recognize and adapt to these changes together.

- Open Communication is Key: Discuss your feelings, fears, and expectations openly. Don’t be afraid to ask for help or express when you’re feeling overwhelmed.
- Flexibility and Patience: Be flexible with routines and expectations. Understand that adjusting to parenthood takes time and patience.
- Make Time for Each Other: While caring for your child is a top priority, carve out moments for connection as a couple. Even a short walk or a cup of tea together can make a difference.
When their twins were born, Ahmed and Sarah were overjoyed but also exhausted. They quickly realized the importance of open communication and flexibility. Ahmed took over night feedings so Sarah could rest, while Sarah made sure Ahmed had time for his morning prayers. By working as a team and adapting to each other’s needs, they navigated the early days of parenthood with grace.
Teamwork and Support: Co-Parenting and Shared Responsibilities
In Islam, both parents are responsible for the upbringing and well-being of their children. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said, “Every one of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock.” This responsibility extends to both spiritual and worldly matters.
- Sharing the Load: Divide tasks like feeding, changing diapers, and playing with your children. This fosters a sense of shared responsibility and teamwork.
- Supporting Each Other’s Parenting Style: Discuss your parenting philosophies and find common ground. Respect each other’s approaches and work together to create a consistent and loving environment for your children.
- Making Decisions Together: Consult each other on important decisions regarding your children’s upbringing, education, and well-being.
Balancing Family Life with Individual Needs
While your children are a priority, it’s crucial for both parents to maintain their individual identities and pursue personal goals.
- Self-Care: Make time for activities that recharge you, whether it’s reading, exercising, or spending time with friends.
- Individual Pursuits: Encourage each other to pursue hobbies, careers, or educational goals.
- Quality Time as a Couple: Don’t forget to nurture your relationship as husband and wife. Schedule date nights, have meaningful conversations, and continue to express your love and appreciation for each other.
Embracing the Journey of Parenthood
The parenting phase is a time of immense love, growth, and learning. By adapting to the shifting dynamics, embracing shared responsibilities, and prioritizing both family and individual needs, couples can create a harmonious and fulfilling family life that is grounded in Islamic values and guided by Allah’s (SWT) blessings.
The Empty Nest Phase: Reconnecting and Rediscovering
When children leave home, it marks a significant transition for couples. This is the “empty nest” phase, a time of both reflection and anticipation. While bittersweet, it also presents a unique opportunity for couples to reconnect, rekindle their romance, and rediscover each other in new and exciting ways. In Islam, this phase can be seen as a return to the core of the marital relationship, where the focus shifts back to companionship, mutual support, and shared spiritual growth.
Rekindling the Romance: Rediscovering Each Other
With more time and freedom, couples can reignite the spark that may have dimmed during the busy years of raising children. This can be a time to:
- Reignite Passion: Plan romantic getaways, surprise each other with thoughtful gifts, and rediscover the joy of spending quality time together.
- Reconnect Emotionally: Engage in deep conversations, share dreams and aspirations, and express your love and appreciation for each other.
- Revisit Shared Interests: Rekindle hobbies or activities you enjoyed together before having children. This can be a fun and meaningful way to reconnect.
After their youngest child left for college, Aisha and Kareem decided to take a trip to a place they had always dreamed of visiting. They spent hours talking, laughing, and simply enjoying each other’s company. The trip rekindled their love and reminded them of the deep bond they shared beyond their roles as parents.
Pursuing Shared Interests and Passions
The empty nest phase provides the perfect opportunity for couples to explore shared interests and passions that may have been put on hold during the child-rearing years. This could involve:
- Traveling: Explore new places, experience different cultures, and create new memories together.
- Learning Together: Enroll in classes, workshops, or online courses on topics that intrigue you both.
- Volunteering: Give back to your community through volunteer work, finding a shared cause that you’re both passionate about.
Embracing New Adventures and Experiences
Don’t be afraid to step outside your comfort zone and try new things. The empty nest phase is a time for growth, exploration, and new beginnings.
- Try a New Hobby: Learn a new language, take up a musical instrument, or start a new fitness routine together.
- Start a Business: If you’ve always dreamed of starting a business, now might be the perfect time to explore that possibility together.
- Reconnect with Old Friends: Reach out to friends you may have lost touch with and rekindle those relationships.
A New Chapter
The empty nest phase can be a beautiful and fulfilling time in a marriage. By embracing the opportunity to reconnect, rediscover each other, and pursue shared passions, couples can strengthen their bond and create a new chapter in their love story, filled with joy, growth, and deeper connection.
The Later Years: Companionship and Deeper Love
In the later years of marriage, the relationship evolves into a tapestry woven with shared memories, experiences, and unwavering love. The Islamic emphasis on respect and care for elders makes this a particularly blessed time, where couples can reap the rewards of a lifetime of commitment and devotion.
Cherishing Shared Memories and Experiences
This is a time to look back on the beautiful journey you’ve traveled together. Recall the laughter, challenges overcome, the joys of raising a family, and the lessons learned along the way.
- Reminisce Together: Take time to reminisce about your favorite memories, whether it’s flipping through old photos, revisiting special places, or simply sharing stories from your past.
- Celebrate Milestones: Anniversaries, birthdays, and other milestones take on a new significance as you reflect on the years you’ve shared.
- Express Gratitude: Take the time to tell each other how much you appreciate and cherish your time together. Simple words of love and gratitude can go a long way.
Fatima and Muhammad have been married for 40 years. Every Friday night, they sit on their porch swing, sipping tea and sharing stories from their past. They laugh about their early courtship, recall the challenges they overcame, and celebrate the milestones they’ve reached together. This simple ritual helps them connect on a deeper level and cherish the rich tapestry of their shared life.
Providing Emotional Support and Care
As couples age, emotional support and care become even more important. This is a time to be each other’s rock, offering a listening ear, a comforting embrace, and unwavering support.
- Be a Shoulder to Lean On: Listen to your partner’s concerns, worries, and anxieties. Offer words of encouragement and support.
- Express Love and Affection: Small gestures like holding hands, giving hugs, and saying “I love you” can make a big difference.
- Show Patience and Understanding: Understand that health concerns and emotional ups and downs are a natural part of aging.
- Care for Each Other’s Needs: Offer assistance with daily tasks as needed, and ensure your partner feels loved and cherished.
Prioritizing Health and Well-being Together
Maintaining physical and mental well-being is crucial in the later years of marriage. Couples can support each other by:
- Encouraging Healthy Habits: Eat nutritious meals, exercise regularly, and get enough rest.
- Seeking Regular Medical Checkups: Keep up with routine doctor’s appointments and prioritize preventive care.
- Staying Socially Connected: Spend time with family and friends, join a community group, or pursue a shared hobby to maintain social engagement.
The later years of marriage are a testament to the enduring power of love, commitment, and companionship. By cherishing memories, providing emotional support, and prioritizing health and well-being together, couples can create a fulfilling and joyous life in their golden years, a testament to the strength of their bond and their faith.
The Importance of Communication and Understanding
Open, honest, and compassionate communication is the cornerstone of any successful Islamic marriage. Throughout the different phases, both husband and wife must express their feelings, listen attentively to each other’s concerns, and work together to find solutions to challenges. The Quran and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet Muhammad PBUH) provide numerous examples and guidance on how to communicate effectively in marriage. Remember, Allah (SWT) says in the Quran:
“…And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them – perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.” (Quran 4:19)
By fostering open dialogue and understanding, couples can build a foundation of trust, respect, and love that will weather any storm.
Adapting to Evolving Needs and Desires
Just as individuals grow and change throughout their lives, so do their needs and desires within a marriage. Recognizing and adapting to these changes is essential for a fulfilling and lasting relationship. Be open to your partner’s evolving aspirations, support their personal growth, and find new ways to connect and create joy together. Remember, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) encouraged couples to show kindness and consideration towards each other, saying,
“The most complete of believers in faith are those with the best character, and the best of you are those who are best to their women.” (Hadith at-Tirmidhi)
Building a Strong and Lasting Relationship
Building a strong and lasting Islamic marriage requires continuous effort, patience, and a commitment to growth. By prioritizing communication, understanding, and mutual respect, couples can create a fulfilling partnership based on Islamic values.
Remember, marriage is a sacred bond bestowed by Allah (SWT). By embracing the journey with faith, love, and unwavering support, couples can build a relationship that not only fulfills their worldly desires but also draws them closer to Allah and the blessings of the Hereafter.

"When you think of art, you likely think of paintings in an expensive gallery or sculptures that have taken hours to make, but art can be accessible for everyone when it’s made outdoors. Art can be about connecting to your surroundings in a new way and slowing down to notice things you might have otherwise overlooked. A fun, easy, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly way to incorporate art in you and your family’s life is to make art in nature, using materials you find outside. Not only will you be able to express your creativity, but you will also get outside and connect with your natural environment, which has been shown to have numerous physical and mental benefits. Making art in nature also allows you to see familiar places with a new lens. Here are some activities that focus on shape, colour and texture to get you started.
Shape: Nature Mosaic
Explore shape by using natural items around you to create a mosaic on the ground. Create images of animals, places, a favourite cartoon character, or even a self-portrait. Breaking the items into pieces allows you to isolate what shapes go into making an image. If you want to create something more abstract, arrange objects in a geometric pattern while experimenting with repetition of similar shapes and objects of different sizes. Use your imagination and the opportunities are endless!
Colour: Value Bar, Colour Wheel & Colour Hunt
Make a value bar, a gradient of the same colour from light to dark, by arranging natural items in a line. If there are a lot of different colours around, make a colour wheel by arranging objects of every colour of the rainbow in a circle and transitioning gradually between shades. If there aren’t many items on the ground that you can pick up, try doing a colour hunt. Bring some small pieces of coloured paper (paint colour samples from a hardware store work well, or you can make your own with coloured markers or construction paper) and try to find items in nature that match the shade on each piece. Repeat these exercises at different times of the year to experience the seasonal changes in colour.
Texture: Crayon Rubbing
Document the variety of textures in nature by making a rubbing. All you need are some pieces of printer paper cut into whatever sizes or shapes you would like and a few wax crayons (with the paper removed). Simply place your paper over the item and lay the crayon flat over the paper. With firm pressure, rub the crayon over the paper and watch the textures emerge onto the page as you go. Good items to make rubbings with include dead leaves, tree bark, western red cedar branches, fern fronds, or anything relatively flat. Nature rubbings make great cards or decorations for recycled giftwrap.
With these activities in your arsenal you’re sure to experience nature in a new way, express your creativity, and connect with your family at the same time! Please remember that you can help ensure our natural spaces stay healthy when making art in nature. Please stay on designated trails to protect habitat. When looking for materials to use in your nature art, use loose items you find on the ground and avoid picking living plants. Instead of removing items from nature, you can take a picture of your creations to take home. The best approach is to take only memories and leave only footprints.

"Buddhist Monastic Economy
The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the monastic economy of the Buddhist religion. The basis for the monastic economy is that a person can experience a great amount of happiness and contentment in this world by not have a great deal of worldly possessions. In fact, having fewer possessions and sharing what one does have with others is really the foundation for the monastic economy (Feiss 101). The Buddhist religion is about bringing simplicity to a person's life. In this regard, the monastic economy is centered around this idea of simplicity. The simplicity comes from not having the burden of trying to obtain large amounts of worldly possessions and then trying to figure out how to hold on to those possessions or comparing what you have to the amount of items that another person has in his possessions.
In many respects, understanding the economy of Buddhist monks is to understand their religious beliefs and ethics. Buddhism attempts to teach peace and harmony to those who practice it. For people who have chosen to become monks of the religion, the economy that surrounds their lifestyle is interconnected with their beliefs in how they can attain happiness and fulfillment in this life.
The Buddhist religion teaches that those who have chosen to move out of the worldly realm of life and to pursue a life of religion can only do so by having in their possession only what is needed to live. This means that Buddhist monks only need the clothing and food that is necessary to sustain their lives. They do not need abundant amounts of food, clothing or other items because these are only obstacles to attaining peach and fulfillment, and they are actually obstacles to those goals. With this basic understanding of the Buddhist religion and of the lives that monks live and the goal of that lifestyle, it is easy to understand that the monastic economy is not about creating wealth or power, but about having what is necessary for the monks in a particular area to live and pursue their religious duties.
Much of the basis of the monastic economy is the growing of grain and other foods that are harvested from the land. Buddhist monks often pursue hours of work in fields producing agricultural products such as wheat and other grains. The growing of grains, fruits, and vegetables allows monks to be able to support themselves off of the land. In this way, the monastic economy is about monks being able to support themselves and not needing to be able to raise money to buy food or other items to support themselves.
However, in the modern era, it almost doesn't need to be mentioned that monks must have some type of way of raising money for items that cannot be grown or produced by the monks themselves. The way of raising money comes from a couple of different areas. The first of these areas is through the sell of grains and other crops grown by monks. The monastic economy is truly dependent upon the work of the monks not only internally to be self-sufficient, but also to allow monks to sell their crops to obtain revenues that can be used for the training of new monks and the construction of temples or other buildings.
The second means by which the monastic economy functions is actually through the gifts and donations of laypeople to the monks. These donations and gifts are important because it is the gifts of land that has allowed the monastic economy to have the resources necessary in modern times to be able to produce crops. In addition, monks can receive many gifts, ranging from clothing to jewelry to money, from laypeople for their services. All of the monks in a monastery receive the benefits of the gifts. They are not used or kept by a single monk because this would go against the teachings of the Buddhist religion.
In more modern times, the monastic economy has broaden into being more than just about using the land and agriculture to sustain the monks. Instead, the monastic economy has spread to include the services and products that can be sold to others from agricultural work. These services can include selling food in restaurants and shops. However, it has almost meant for some monasteries the running of hotels and even factors (Harvey 203). In this regard, the modern era has really seen the monastic economy spread outside of purely agricultural pursuits. However, for the monks themselves, the monastic economy is still about working to get in touch with a feeling of contentment. The businesses are seen as helping others and providing services. The revenues that are raised are used for the monasteries and all of the monks. These businesses are not intended for individual monks to receive salaries and begin to acquire their own possessions outside of what is needed for life in the monastery (Ji).
In many respects, this description of the monastic economy of the Buddhist religion shows that the monastic economy has had to change as life has evolved. At one time, the monastic economy truly centered around purely agricultural pursuits. However, modern times have meant that the monastic economy encompasses other pursuits including restaurants, hotels, and services to the larger public. However, for the monks who have taken a calling to pursue a religious life of attaining peach and contentment, the basics of the monastic economy still exist. Monks work to benefit the entire monastery and even the larger population of laypeople. They do not work to obtain wealth and worldly possessions for themselves.
In fact, the monastic economy can be seen in the actual Buddha temple and its layout. For example, the Jade Buddha Temple in Shanghai, which was founded in 1882, has two large Buddha statues. There area also other smaller Buddha statues that are present to remind the monks and the laypeople who visit the temple of the traditions and beliefs of the Buddhists. The temple also has a great hall and a chamber housing the Jade Buddha. What is interesting, however, is that the Jade Buddha Temple in Shanghai also has two restaurants for the laypeople who visit the temple throughout the year. One of the restaurants has a variety of dishes of soup and noodles that are very inexpensive. This restaurant has tables where visitors are served, and the tables may be shared among many people, rather than just those who traveled together to the temple. A second restaurant also operates at the temple with more formal dinning services and higher prices.
This is an example of the current state of the monastic economy. The temple and monastery is still the center of monastic life and the monastic economy. However, the way in which monks raise money and support themselves, and work to attain peace and continent has changed through decades and centuries. Of course, the serving of food created from agricultural pursuits and the serving of others without regard to personal wealth or possessions is still the cornerstone of the monastic economy.

This comprehensive guide will help you understand what to look for in the best slot sites and provide you with the knowledge to make an informed choice.
1. Understanding Slot Sites
Slot sites are online platforms that offer a variety of slot games, which are digital versions of the classic casino game. These platforms typically feature a wide range of slots, from traditional three-reel games to modern video slots with advanced graphics and bonus features. Many 슬롯사이트 also offer progressive jackpot slots, where the potential payout increases as more players participate.
The appeal of slot sites lies in their accessibility. Players can enjoy games from their desktop, laptop, or mobile device at any time, making it convenient for people with busy lifestyles. Moreover, many slot sites offer bonuses and promotions that enhance the gaming experience.
2. Why Slot Sites Are Popular
Several factors contribute to the popularity of slot sites:
- Convenience: Players can access slot games from anywhere and at any time, making them more accessible than land-based casinos.
- Variety: Slot sites often offer hundreds, if not thousands, of different slot games with various themes, paylines, and bonus features, ensuring there’s something for everyone.
- Bonuses and Promotions: Online slot sites regularly provide bonuses like free spins, deposit matches, and loyalty rewards to attract and retain players.

3. Key Factors to Consider When Choosing Slot Sites
When selecting a slot site, there are several important factors to keep in mind to ensure you have a safe, fair, and enjoyable experience.
A. Licensing and Regulation
The most crucial factor when choosing a slot site is its licensing and regulatory status. A reputable slot site should be licensed by a recognized gambling authority, such as the UK Gambling Commission, the Malta Gaming Authority, or the Gibraltar Regulatory Authority. These organizations ensure that the slot site adheres to strict standards for fairness, security, and responsible gambling.
Avoid slot sites that are not licensed, as they may not follow fair gaming practices, and there is a risk of financial loss without proper recourse.
B. Game Variety
The best slot sites offer a diverse range of games from multiple software providers. This ensures that players have access to various game styles, themes, and features, from classic fruit slots to modern video slots with interactive elements. Look for slot sites that partner with reputable software developers like Microgaming, NetEnt, Playtech, and Pragmatic Play, as these companies are known for creating high-quality and fair games.
C. Bonuses and Promotions
Bonuses and promotions can significantly enhance your gaming experience by giving you extra chances to win. The most common types of bonuses found on slot sites include:
- Welcome Bonuses: These are offered to new players when they sign up and make their first deposit. They often include a deposit match (e.g., 100% up to a certain amount) and free spins.
- No Deposit Bonuses: Some slot sites offer bonuses that do not require an initial deposit, allowing players to try games for free.
- Free Spins: These are awarded on specific slot games and can help boost your chances of winning without using your own money.
- Reload Bonuses and Cashback: Regular players can benefit from these bonuses, which add value to subsequent deposits or give a percentage of losses back.
When evaluating bonuses, it’s essential to read the terms and conditions. Pay close attention to wagering requirements, which dictate how many times the bonus amount must be wagered before you can withdraw any winnings.
D. Payment Methods
A good slot site should offer a variety of payment options for both deposits and withdrawals. Look for sites that support major credit cards, e-wallets (such as PayPal, Skrill, or Neteller), bank transfers, and even cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the withdrawal process should be quick and easy, with reasonable processing times.
Check for any fees associated with transactions and ensure the site uses secure payment methods to protect your financial information.
E. Mobile Compatibility
With the increasing use of smartphones and tablets, mobile compatibility is a crucial factor when choosing a slot site. The best slot sites have mobile-optimized websites or dedicated apps that provide a seamless gaming experience on various devices. Look for sites that offer a large selection of mobile-friendly games, ensuring you can enjoy your favorite slots on the go.
F. Customer Support
Reliable customer support is a hallmark of a reputable slot site. Players may need assistance with account issues, payment queries, or technical problems, so it’s important that the site offers prompt and effective support. Look for slot sites that provide multiple contact methods, such as live chat, email, and phone support, and ensure their support team is available 24/7.

- PartyCasino: Provides a generous welcome bonus, regular promotions, and a variety of slots, including exclusive games.
- 888 Casino: One of the oldest online casinos, known for its reliability and diverse game selection.
5. Winning Strategies for Playing Slots
While slot games are based on chance, there are a few strategies you can employ to maximize your enjoyment and potential wins:
- Set a Budget: Always determine how much you are willing to spend and stick to it. This helps prevent overspending and ensures you gamble responsibly.
- Choose the Right Games: Look for slots with high Return to Player (RTP) percentages, which indicate the average amount returned to players over time.
- Take Advantage of Bonuses: Use bonuses and promotions to extend your playtime and increase your chances of hitting a big win.
- Practice with Free Games: Many slot sites offer free versions of their games. Use these to familiarize yourself with the game mechanics before playing with real money.

"The Emperor’s New Clothes, adapted from the novel The Death of Napoleon by Simon Leys and directed by Alan Taylor is a charming “counterfactual” history so cleverly written and so competently acted you are likely to find that it almost makes you forget the sheer preposterousness of its premiss. This is that the Emperor Napoleon, in exile on St. Helena, manages to change places with a double, an ordinary seaman called Eugène Lenormand who is serving on a French merchant vessel carrying molasses to Brest. The plan is for him to land at Brest, proclaim his arrival as the imposter on St. Helena simultaneously unmasks himself and proceed to put forth the call for his loyal troops to rally around him once again.
But it all goes wrong. Instead of landing at Brest, the master of the ship goes on to Brussels where he can get a better price for his molasses. Napoleon is left to make his way by stagecoach back to France while the double finds that he rather likes being Napoleon and decides not to unmask himself after all. “That man was emperor for 18 years while I was scrubbing the decks of his ships,” he tells the Emperor’s horrified flunkies and hangers on. “Well now it’s my turn.” And so it is that Napoleon arrives in Paris indistinguishable from the madmen, of whom we see a whole asylum-full, who only believe themselves to be Napoleon.
This raises the very interesting philosophical question of just what it is that distinguishes a former Emperor who thinks he’s Napoleon from anyone else who thinks he’s Napoleon. And, slightly less interesting, is the question of what makes one man a Napoleon and another a common sailor — and whether whatever it is is repeatable or only the result of historical accident. There is some attention paid to the latter question, especially in a marvelously comic account of how the Emperor’s strategic genius and powers of leadership are employed in organizing his neighbors to sell off an over-supply of Provençal watermelons at a profit. But on the whole the film avoids its more serious implications to concentrate instead on pushing what is in my view the rather dubious proposition that if Napoleon had been happily married to a good wife he’d have lost his desire to conquer the world and settled down to contentment as a Parisian costermonger.
That summary is a bit of an oversimplification, but not much. The movie takes a typically modern and uncomprehending attitude to traditional ideas of honor and glory, the thirst for which it imagines as an emanation of some anomalous and unhappy psychological state. There are also a couple of very large holes in the narrative. The sailor could hardly have been put ashore at St. Helena and the Emperor put in his place without the knowledge of the ship’s master, for instance. Nor is it credible to suppose that Napoleon could have appeared in Paris after only six years of exile, without any disguise, and been recognized by no one.
Yet I did not find any of these doubts or shortcomings insuperable difficulties in the way of my enjoyment of the movie. This is mainly on account of the performance of the great Ian Holm in the roles both of Napoleon and Lenormand and the lovely Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity, Mifune) as Pumpkin, the young widow with whom the quondam Emperor finds happiness at last. Or at first, one supposes, since the film seems to imply that his career as Emperor was the result not only of talent, ambition and opportunity but also of domestic discontent. Josephine loved her jewels, he comments ruefully.
This is one of the many small pleasures in which the film has decided to specialize. There are many others, including Napoleon’s first sight of Lenormand — upon which he remarks to his aide: “What are we going to do? He looks nothing like me” — and the idiot grin on the sailor’s face as he is given the imperial treatment. I also found it funny rather than off-putting that the sailor is able to take up where Napoleon left off in the dictation of his memoirs without missing a beat. Each is as much of a fantasist as the other, in his own way, and an echo of the Emperor’s refusal to acknowledge the similarity in their appearances comes as he sees a copy of the bogus memoir in a bookshop and begins tearing it up in fury.
I even found it genuinely touching when the Emperor revealed himself to Pumpkin and she refused to believe him. “I offer you a world and you do not believe me?” he asks her.
“I believe in you, Eugène,” she cries.
“Eugène Lenormand is nothing!”
“He is everything to me.”
“I am Napoleon!”
“No. I hate Napoleon. He has filled France with widows and orphans. He took my husband. I won’t let him take you.”
There is a real note of feminine authenticity in this flare-up of resentment against the whole male world that must always cost women such heartache. So much so, indeed, as to make you wish that there were, as there is not, a corresponding sense of authenticity about the Emperor’s ultimate abdication in favor of such a charming and delightful creature as this.",0.9776659607887268,1151,1.7970123291015625

"Can you spot all the things wrong here?
Hint: it's more than ten. And there's one VERY big error.
(This is NOT a trick quiz!)
Hello, my name is [agent name redacted]. (1) I am the literary agent for [author name redacted], who has a debut novel set to be published in January. The novel’s working title (2) is [book title redacted], and it is a Fantasy novel geared towards children and young adults.(3) It’s a full-length novel, totaling over 100,000 words.(4) The novel is going through the final stages of editing and will be sent to a publisher soon. (5) Because we understand that blogs may become all booked up by the time of publication, or even pre-publication, we are seeking to schedule a tour early. (6) This tour is not strictly for blogs, we are seeking publicity on all platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms. If you choose to partake in the tour, you would be supplied with a media pack based upon the type of post or feature you would like to do. The media pack would include, but is not limited to: Advanced Reader Copies of the novel, Synopsis, Images of exclusive Illustrations done specifically for the novel (7) , a book trailer, graphics/banners, etc.
All tour participants will receive an entry to win a hard copy of the book after publication (8), a follow up interview the author if so desired, swag items, and $25 dollar gift card to Amazon. (9)
The top five tour participants with the most traffic to the tour post will be entered into a giveaway to receive a SIGNED copy of the novel after publication (10), a follow up interview with the author if so desired, exclusive, custom-made swag, an interview with the illustrator, $50 dollar gift card, and exclusive opportunities for ARCs by [author name redacted]. (11)
All participants, if they so desired, will be featured on the Facebook page for the author and other platforms. (12)
We are seeking to do a 2 month long tour, starting in December of this year until the end of January 2016. There are currently openings for the following:
Or a combination of any of these. If you have any other ideas, please do let us know. We’re open to suggestions. If you do not have a space on your blog, and would still like to participate via social media platforms, let us know!
Thank for you for your time in reading this. If you are interested, send us a date and the type of post you’d like to do!
(13) The biggest error of all.
Here are the major ones I spotted in the first skim:
1. Hello, my name is [agent name redacted].
A proper pitch letter does not evoke shouts of ""Prepare to Die""**
2. The novel’s working title
The book is slated for publication in January of 2016 and the title hasn't been finalized? How did you get an ISBN? How did you list it on Amazon? What did you call it when you sent it to PW for review (3-6 months pre-pub of course!)
3. a Fantasy novel geared towards children and young adults.
this demonstrates a very clear absence of understanding of both kids and YA readers. Generally the books that kids ages 10-12 read are not the same books being read by young people 16-18. And YA is frequently read by adults. A book that appeals to middle grade readers isn't generally something an adult will read for pleasure.
4. totaling over 100,000 words.
I'm almost afraid to ask how many more than 100,000 words it is. And middle grade (children) don't read books of this length.
5. will be sent to a publisher soon.
This is the one that left me rolling on the floor howling. A publisher? Like a specific one, or just maybe a Random House? Either you have a contract with a publisher (in which case it's THE publisher) or you are sending the book on submission in which case it's not going to be published in January 2016 unless you man you're being ""published"" by SmashWords.
6. we are seeking to schedule a tour early.
I didn't get up off the floor for this one. It's 11/17/15. That's TEN weeks from the END of January 2016. In other words, this isn't early. This is already too late!
Blog tours are planned MONTHS ahead of pub date, and solicitations are sent 3-4 months ahead of pub date; even earlier if the blog is a busy one.
7. exclusive Illustrations done specifically for the novel
as opposed to illustrations stolen from google images?
8. All tour participants will receive an entry to win a hard copy of the book after publication.
Clearly no one mentioned to this ""literary agent"" that when you promote a book, it's common practice to send a finished copy of the book to blog reviewers unless they've asked specifically not to get one. You don't have to ""win one."" It's not a prize.
9. follow up interview the author if so desired, swag items, and $25 dollar gift card to Amazon.
Again, this poor soul has the idea that you have to ""win"" a follow up interview. I can tell you that if a blogger wants to interview one of my guyz twice, I'll happily make that happen. We're glad of the eyeballs; we're thrilled with readers and fans helping get the word out.
And don't get me started on ""swag items"" particularly unspecified ones. Unless the author is really well known, swag isn't quite the compelling thing you wish it were.
and the real problem: this pitch REQUIRES that any blogger talking about the book reveal the possibility of monetary compensation.
Thus: ""I reviewed this book and the publisher/author/agent has offered me a chance to win an Amazon Gift Card for doing so."" Right there, you've damaged BEYOND REPAIR any kind of chance for effective publicity.
You don't buy publicity. You buy MARKETING.
10. The top five tour participants with the most traffic to the tour post will be entered into a giveaway to receive a SIGNED copy of the novel after publication
oh wow, the books you send to the guys in #9 won't be signed? That's really really funny. Again, this is just textbook clueless. This isn't even thinking about the process.
11. exclusive opportunities for ARCs by [author name redacted].
I'm really hoping this is a second author, not the same one we've been talking about. And again, the idea that you have to ""win"" a chance to get a book is ludicrous.
12. All participants, if they so desired, will be featured on the Facebook page for the author and other platforms
Because of course, we're not already going to be linking to the posts! This isn't a benefit to the blogger! This is just trying to build buzz for the author. This demonstrates a COMPLETE lack of understanding of how promotions work.
Can you imagine saying to The New York Times: hey, if you interview me, we'll feature you on our Facebook page?
(13) The biggest error of all.
This was sent to Victoria Strauss. As in PITCHED to Victoria, as if she might want to participate. Writer Beware doesn't buzz books. It's very clear this was just a mass email sent to every name some poor witless inexperienced fool could find. (I get these sometimes too, but at least I didn't get this one!)
I have go lie down with a cool cloth over my fevered brow.
If this is YOUR agent, you need a new one.
If someone tells you that they're going to help you do a blog tour, ask to see their pitch email.
Clearly this person has invested NO time at all in research or reading books on promotion. There are some good ones.
Even reading the guidelines for submissions on review blogs will help you avoid some of these boneheaded errors.
A good pitch letter is like a good query. It tells you what the book is about VERY concisely. It mentions category. It includes publication date. It includes blurbs if you've got them.
A good pitch package will also include: trade reviews; sample questions for an interview; author bio.
And it includes the book. ALWAYS!
A very good pitch is personalized.
I spend time every month sending out ARCs of client books. All the letters often have the same bone structure but each has some element of personalization.
Effective PR is just like effective querying.
All that time and effort y'all are investing on writing good queries is time well-spent for the next phase of your publishing career: talking about your book well.",0.9617951512336731,1883,0.830796480178833
"“The festival organizers contacted me because they were getting pressure from the BDS movement. They wanted me to write a letter, or make a video, stating my positions on Zionism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to pacify the BDS people. I support peace and compassion for all people. My music speaks for itself, and I do not insert politics into my music. Music has the power to transcend the intellect, ideas, and politics, and it can unite people in the process. The festival kept insisting that I clarify my personal views; which felt like clear pressure to agree with the BDS political agenda. Honestly it was appalling and offensive, that as the one publicly Jewish-American artist scheduled for the festival they were trying to coerce me into political statements. Were any of the other artists scheduled to perform asked to make political statements in order to perform? No artist deserves to be put in such a situation simply to perform his or her art. Regardless of race, creed, country, cultural background, etc, my goal is to play music for all people. As musicians that is what we seek. – Blessed Love, Matis”
There’s been no word from Festival organizers about whether or not other artists appearing at the Festival will also be asked to declare a loyalty oath to BDS. For instance, Barrington Levy who is performing on the main stage on August 18th has performed in Israel as has Lee “Scratch” Perry who is performing on the main stage on August 21st. And what about all the artists with Jewish management and musical collaborators? If I were BDS, I’d be all up in that trying to find out the hidden Zionists. Get on it yo!

"Don’t Get Lost in The Digital Productivity Tool Carnival
We’re living in a digital utopia where tools rain down like confetti at a parade.
The allure of the latest apps, platforms, and software can be overwhelming, often leaving us questioning if we’ve truly optimized our workflows or if we’re merely drowning.
I’ve worked for several productivity apps and the same thing would happen every January: visits and downloads would go up.
People searching for the next best thing, the latest and the greatest.
It can be a carnival out there, but before you get lost in the neon lights of the productivity Ferris wheel, let’s talk about why less is more.
The number of tools is dizzying
So, you’re at the carnival, surrounded by productivity tools juggling for your attention and the paradox of choice hits harder than a tilt-a-whirl.
Does having a bazillion tools make us more productive, or are we just spinning in circles, hoping one of them will magically solve all our problems?
While having options is generally considered a good thing, the paradox of choice suggests that too many choices can lead to decision paralysis and dissatisfaction.",0.9218764305114746,257,1.330176830291748
"Stephanie Burgis My Journal 1257189 Curiosities served |
2008-05-12 3:52 PM family history and great social history Previous Entry :: Next Entry Read/Post Comments (0) It's funny, being American - I know, of course, most of the different countries and ethnicities/religions that my various ancestors came from, but apart from the occasional bit that's filtered through to my own generation (klezmer music as a familiar background sound, the occasional Croatian phrase that I picked up from my grandfather, etc.), and my own occasional writing-homages to my heritage (I've written several fantasy stories using Croatian folklore specifically because of my very-much-loved Croatian relatives), I tend to forget how much influence those genetic inheritances can have in my predominantly American identity.
Today I watched the BBC Young Musician of the Year: 2008 Grand Final round of the competition. The first performer, an amazing guitarist named Jadran Duncombe, came on - and wow, did he look a lot like my youngest brother, especially in his hair and facial structure. Guess what? He's also part-Croatian, just like us. Then after Jadran's performance, the presenter interviewed his brother Emil - and at the first glance I thought: that is my brother! The second glance was enough to prove I was wrong - in fact there were an awful lot of differences in their faces - but it was a shock anyway...and a big reminder of how much we're shaped by the people who came before us in our families, no matter how distant their home countries might be from where we are now. And speaking of the past, I spent a huge portion of this weekend devouring the best and most fun book I've read in a long, long time: Agatha Christie's An Autobiography. I picked it up at the library only out of random (and fairly mild) curiosity, but ended up adoring it. I'm not a particular fan of autobiographies in general, but this one was wonderfully witty, often hilarious, and absolutely full of fascinating details of social history, wonderfully told. I spent the weekend reading it almost non-stop, pausing only to read particularly funny bits out loud to Patrick, who's also planning to read it now, based on those excerpts. I'm already planning to buy myself a copy just for the pleasure of re-reading, but if I ever want to write a book or story set in England between 1890-1930, I will be going back to it and taking hundreds of notes! She includes exactly the kinds of details of clothing, furniture, social customs, etc., that writers of historical fiction desperately need and often can't find - and does it all so entertainingly that I couldn't stop reading until I was finished, Sunday morning. I've never enjoyed an autobiography so much - it's definitely, definitely worth reading, if there's anyone else who hasn't read it yet!

"Are you looking for ways to level up your Google Ads game? As digital marketing specialists, we’ve seen time and time again how a few advanced tactics can make all the difference in the success of a Google Ads campaign.
Keep reading to discover our 3 advanced Google Ads tips that can help you increase click-through rates, improve ad relevance, and ultimately drive more conversions. If you’ve already got a basic understanding of Google Ads, these tips will help you take your campaigns to the next level.
So, let’s dive in and explore these advanced tactics that will give you the edge you need to stay ahead of the pack.
Basic Google Ads Tips
Before we dive into the advanced tactics, let’s quickly review some basic Google Ads tips that you should already be familiar with. These tips are essential to the success of any Google Ads campaign, so make sure you have them down pat before moving on to the more advanced strategies.
First and foremost, make sure your targeting is on point. This means not only targeting the right keywords but also targeting the right audience. Use Google’s keyword planner tool to research and select the most relevant keywords for your campaign. You can also use audience targeting options to reach your ideal customer demographics.
Creating compelling ad copy is a must. You know the drill. Make it click-worthy, and relevant, and don’t beat around the bush. Lastly, make sure your landing page is optimized for conversions. Here you want to make sure there’s a clear path to conversion. Make it easy for users to take the desired action.
Advanced Google Ads Tips
Now that we’ve reviewed the basics, let’s dive into the advanced tactics that will give you the edge you need to succeed.
Tip 1: Ad Extensions
Ad extensions are additional pieces of information that can be added to your ad, providing more value to the user and potentially increasing click-through rates. There are several types of ad extensions, including site link extensions, call extensions, and review extensions.
Sitelink extensions allow you to include additional links to specific pages on your website within your ad. This can help users find exactly what they’re looking for and make it easier for them to navigate your site.
Call extensions make it possible for users to call your business directly from the ad.
Review extensions are a great way to showcase positive reviews or awards your business has received, providing social proof and building trust with potential customers.
By utilizing ad extensions, you can make your ads more relevant and valuable to users, potentially increasing click-through rates and driving more conversions.
Tip 2: Audience Targeting
While targeting the right keywords is important, targeting the right audience can be even more effective. Google Ads offers several audience targeting options, including demographic targeting, remarketing, and in-market targeting.
Demographic targeting lets you target users based on factors like age, gender, and income.
Remarketing enables users to be targeted that have already interacted with your site or ads. This makes it easier to bring them back and convert them into customers.
In-market targeting allows you to target users who are actively researching and considering products or services similar to what you offer.
This advanced Google Ads tip ensures that your ads are being shown to the right people at the right time, increasing the likelihood of conversions.
Tip 3: Incorporating Negative Keywords
Negative keywords are keywords that you don’t want your ads to show for. By incorporating negative keywords into your campaign, you can ensure that your ads are only being shown to users who are likely to be interested in your product or service.
For example, if you sell high-end watches, you may want to include negative keywords like “cheap watches” or “affordable watches.” In doing so users looking for budget-friendly options (who probably aren’t going to land up buying your product) won’t see your ad. This improves ad relevance and may increase click-through rates and conversions.
Measuring the Success of Your Google Ads Campaign
Now that you’ve implemented these advanced tactics, you need to measure the success of your campaign. Google Ads provides several metrics that you can use to track the effectiveness of your campaign, including click-through rates, conversion rates, and cost-per-conversion.
By tracking these metrics, you can determine the effectiveness of your campaign and make adjustments as needed.
Common Mistakes to Avoid
Don’t let all your hard work go to waste. Be sure to avoid common Google Ads mistakes.
Neglecting to optimize your landing page is one such mistake. Make sure your landing page is mobile-friendly, as loads of users access the internet on their phones.
Don’t make the mistake of not tracking and analyzing your campaign data! You’ll miss out on valuable insights that could help improve the effectiveness of your campaign.
And don’t neglect to test and experiment with your campaigns. By testing different ad copy, targeting options, and ad formats, you’ll find what works best for you.
Resources for Learning More About Google Ads
If you’re looking to learn more about Google Ads, we’d recommend looking at these resources:
- The Google Ads Help Center for information on how to use Google Ads, tutorials, and best practices.
- The Google Ads Academy offers free online courses.
- The Google Ads Blog for updates and insights on the latest features and best practices.
These three advanced Google Ads tips can help you level up your Google Ads game and drive more conversions. By utilizing ad extensions, audience targeting, and negative keywords, you can improve ad relevance and increase click-through rates.
Make sure to measure the success of your campaign and avoid common mistakes like neglecting to optimize your landing page or not tracking your campaign data. With these tips and resources, you’ll be well on your way to Google Ads success.

"We use energy for a lot of things in our every day. Many of the technological products we use are based on energy. Most of these products are very helpful for us and make our every day much easier. But if these products have to stay forever, we need to base them on green energy from e.g wind turbines. The energy production damages our environment too much. Read the following part to get to know more about green energy
What is green energy and why is it important?
As mentioned earlier we use a lot of energy in our energy. Our computer, our TV, our heat in the house and many many more things are based on energy. That means we use a lot of energy, which of course damages the environment in the long run. Therefore, we have to use green energy.
Green energy is a way to produce energy. Most of the production right now is bad for the environment, but the green energy is meant to be a better option for the environment. It is based on natural things such as water, wind and sunshine. That means it is both better for the environment and a persistent source.
Fortunately we are getting much better at producing green energy. Wind turbines produced 43 percent of Denmark’s electricity consumption in 2017, which is the highest percentage ever.
How can we use green energy even better?
We produce a lot of energy with wind turbines and other green ways, but we need to find a way to make it replace oil, petrol and so on soon. Fortunately the market for electric cars is growing in both Denmark and the rest of the world. There was sold about 3000 electric cars in Denmark in 2018, which is an increase of 321 percent compared to 2017. That is a very good evolution for the environment and is due to many different things. First of all there are coming a lot of new alternatives. There are so many giant car brands trying to get into the electric car market, because they know it is the future. The electric cars are also fairly cheap in Denmark, because the government have chosen to put less charges on them.
Why should you buy an electric car?
- Much better for the
- Many cool designs

"The streaky Milwaukee Brewers hope to end a downward trend when they continue a six-game trip with a three-game set against the Oakland Athletics starting Friday night.
Both teams played afternoon affairs on Thursday, and each continued a recent pattern.
The Brewers were beaten 3-0 on the road by the St. Louis Cardinals, a second straight defeat following a six-game winning streak.
Milwaukee had won five in a row, then lost three straight, before the six-game flurry.
Coming off the shutout loss, the Brewers expect Blake Perkins to return to the starting lineup in the opener in Oakland. The outfielder/DH hasn’t played since Aug. 11 because of a calf injury.
Perkins is one of Milwaukee’s top hitters against left-handed pitchers, with a .290 average against them. Oakland is scheduled to start lefty JP Sears on Friday.
“This time of year, you’ve got to kind of try to play through things if you can,” Perkins noted. “Lucky for me, it was just a little bit of rest, and I’m hoping to just be good the rest of the time.”
Meanwhile, Oakland has won or tied five consecutive series thanks to a 3-1 win Thursday over the Tampa Bay Rays that squared the four-game set at 2-2.
The A’s have allowed just 10 runs in their last six games.
Manager Mark Kotsay praised his starting staff for putting his team in a position to win on a daily basis by taking some of the burden off what had been a busy bullpen.
“The confidence is high,” he said of his starters. “All these guys have been able to get through five innings, six, deeper. And the bullpen, at the start of the week they were pretty tired. It was great (Thursday) to have all the guys lined up and utilize them in their roles and it worked.”
Five relievers contributed to Thursday’s six-hit effort, combining for four shutout innings.
Hoping to keep the run going will be Sears (10-8, 4.15), who is unbeaten in his last four starts, going 3-0 with a 1.57 ERA. The 28-year-old got the win in his only career start against the Brewers, allowing two runs in five innings in an 8-6 road victory in June 2023.
The A’s swept that three-game set in Milwaukee. The Brewers haven’t won a series at Oakland since taking three of four in 1995.
The Brewers are expected to counter in the opener Friday with righty Aaron Civale (4-8, 4.78), who is on a nice little run of his own. After going winless over his first five starts for the Brewers following an in-season trade from the Rays, Civale has won each of his last two outings, allowing a total of two runs in 12 1/3 innings against the Cincinnati Reds and Cleveland Guardians.
The 29-year-old, a former American Leaguer, doesn’t have a decision to show for either of his previous lifetime head-to-heads with the A’s. He is 0-0 with a 6.75 ERA in two starts.

"Kisumu RFC was formed in 1982 and has thus been in existence for over 30 years. For most of those years however, the club did not feature in top flight rugby and was hardly a factor. In fact Kisumu RFC has often fallen on hard times and was once disbanded in 1988 before being revived in 1990.
Throughout its existence, Kisumu RFC has survived on a shoestring budget. Unlike clubs like Nakuru RFC, Mombasa Sports club and the premier Nairobi clubs, Kisumu RFC has never had a training ground on its own and has often had to borrow facilities from Kisumu Polytechnic. Not having a training ground has been a severe limiting factor. Over the years the club has been dependent on the generosity of financiers like Lutta Kasamani and more recently Karyna Jerusha Okwaro, a die hard rugby fan who passed away in Mid 2012. With the passing of the generous Mrs Okwaro, the clubs fortunes have taken a turn for the worse and even making it to away games has become a major challenge. In fact the club has failed to appear for a number of away matches.
Do not let the talent go to waste
Kisumu RFC has over the years produced several players who later played for the national team or for the bigger Nairobi clubs. The list includes players like current Kenya Rugby sevens captain Andrew Amonde, Ted Omondi, and going further back Jim Owino and Dennis Awori, one of the greatest sevens players Kenya has ever produced.
In addition, the Kisumu area has plenty of talent available from schools like Maseno School, Maseno University, St Marys Yala, Among the players who have recently emerged from this area include national team players like Benjamin Ayimba, Lesley Mango, Paul Oimbo, Lavin Asego and Victor Oduor.
Should Kisumu RFC fall apart, many of the players currently residing in that part of the country will have nowhere to play rugby. The national team will thus miss out on all the talent available. And with the current poor state of the club, players are unlikely to be motivated to play. In fact it is possible that some players have quit due to the poor state of the club, thus making it impossible for the team to get enough traveling players. Fans from the Lakeside region are likely to tune out as well. Loss of a segment of the fan base is something that Kenya rugby cannot afford to do. Establishing a professional league is dependent on having a large enough fan base and thus Kenya rugby must continue to grow and not shrink its fan base.
KRFU Must Step in aggressively
The reasons above as well as Kisumu RFC’s history of poverty make it imperative that the KRFU must step in to rescue the club. KRFU must use its expertise to perform an in-depth analysis that identifies the issue facing the club and come up with solutions. If the current officials are the problem then KRFU must take over running the club on an interim basis to provide stability. This act along is likely to bring to lift sagging morale at the club. There is precedent for this : In 2011, the IRB took over running the Namibian rugby Union when Namibia rugby was falling apart.
Speaking of the IRB, one can make the case to IRB to provide some funding for struggling clubs like Kisumu RFC. Surely KRFU can make IRB understand the critical importance of keeping the club afloat given that it exists in a talent and fan-rich area.
Long Term solutions.
KRFU must identify potential long term solutions for the clubs perennial problems.Western Bulls which has existed for a much shorter period is not facing similar problems. Perhaps Kisumu can apply some lessons from them. KRFU should help Kisumu RFC come up with ways to raise revenue, to entice players to come and play and entice fans to show up for games.
Seek Government support
With the new constitutional dispensation, KRFU might be able to make the case to the county governor to provide a piece of land on which a rugby field can be built. It need not be anything spectactular. Just a field with two rugby goals and two benches will suffice to begin with. If the county government does not cooperate then perhaps the national government will. Sports is a critical element in keeping the youth busy in positive activities and away from crime and drugs. Sports can also provide employment and income for the youth. And with crime spiraling out of control and youth unemployment hovering at 60%, its high time KRFU started to aggressively make the case that the national as well as county governments should provide material support for sports like rugby. Virtually all the rugby grounds in Kenya today were bequeathed by the colonial government as far back as the 1930s. It is a crying shame that since Independence in 1963, successive governments have not seen it fit to provide rugby grounds.

"Managed to make a visit to the beach for the first time in ages, then we went two weeks running. The first time the wind was a bit to strong for comfort. The second time was just perfect. In the meantime, we try to get down to the village pool and put in some lengths before the crowds arrive.
There was a lucky escape, when a fire started at the side of the main road near our finca. One of our neighbours reported at to the ""Bombers"" who put it out before it did too much damage. A few trees in one finca were scorched, but I think they will come back eventually.
Our chillies and tomatoes are doing well, despite the occasional gale, which means we don't know what is what until the start producing because all the labels disappeared.. This could be tricky with the chillies, as there are 6 varieties. We will find out what is what soon enough.
Cleo had her pups down in the barranc on the 18th of June. We eventually found her hide. It was an abandonded burrow under a south facing olive tree on the edge of the barranc. It was very well hidden and she took different approach routes to it to avoid detection. Anyway, one morning in the first week of July, PondGirl was filling up the watering can from the tank behind the almacen when she heard noises, shrieked, and we found the Cleo's puppies tucked into the gap between the back wall of the almacen and the rainwater tank. She had carried them up one by one, from the barranc (about 300 metres away) and put them in a sandy excavation she had made near the end of the gap sometime during the previous night. We took these photo's and counted 9 pups, which must have made it quite a chore.
A little later, we realized there were 11 puppies, 6 girls & 5 boys. By now they were already 3 weeks old and full of beans. We made a temporary barrier with breezeblocks to pen them into an area that was safe for them and tried to work out what we were going to do with 11 puppies. Cleo would still barely let us touch her, so vets trips were out. One morning we found Cleo walking away from the den with the black one (Piglet) in her mouth. We assumed the puppy was dead and after a bit of trying coaxed it from her mouth. Actually the pup was lying doggo and we think that Cleo was taking her off to dump her as 11 mouths were too many. The only thing we could do to help, was to start them on a mush of dog food & water straight away. They loved this, but still loved the milk bar.",0.9935807585716248,570,0.9494180083274841
"What’s one of the biggest culprits for the rise of unnecessary medical testing?
Before most patients undergo surgery or an invasive procedure, they are normally sent to their primary care physicians for a “preoperative evaluation.” This is a visit to determine if they are medically stable enough to undergo the operation.
Tests like bloodwork, an EKG, or a chest x-ray are frequently ordered. For those with suspicion of coronary artery disease, a stress test is sometimes considered, based on the patient’s symptoms.
According to a recent study, however, may of these tests may be unwarranted. Not only do they waste money, they also can potentiate further, more invasive, studies that stem from incidentilomas.
Published in Obstetrics & Gynecology, researchers,
reviewed medical records for women who underwent gynecologic surgery at their center between 2005 and 2007. They found that 95 percent of the 1,402 patients received all the recommended testing, but 90 percent had at least one test that was not necessary based on guidelines from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE).
None of the 749 urine tests, the 407 liver function tests, or the 1,046 tests of blood clotting factors were appropriate, while 99 percent of the 427 chest X-rays ordered were not appropriate. Only 36 percent of the electrocardiograms and 29 percent of complete blood counts were in accordance with “evidence-based” guidelines.
There are several reasons. Of course, malpractice worry is at the back of most doctors’ minds. As the chief author puts it, “‘Number one, certainly, a lot of this is medicolegal’ — meaning, basically, doctors don’t want to get sued for not having a test done.”
Also, the entire medical team needs to be on the same page. Meaning, the preoperative guidelines for the primary care doctor, surgeon, and anesthesiologist has to be the same.
If I don’t feel like a certain preoperative test is necessary, for instance, it shouldn’t be ordered by a consultant. This is difficult in most practices, where the preoperative doctor, surgeon and anesthesiologist operate under separate auspices.
Having everyone under the same roof, such as in a large, integrative practice, can help in consolidating the recommendations and, perhaps, reduce $3 billion wasted on unnecessary preoperative tests.",0.9588280320167542,510,2.2631335258483887

The NFL has cleared Green Bay’s Clay Matthews and Julius Peppers and Pittsburgh’s James Harrison in an investigation of whether they were provided with or used performance enhancers. Each player met with league investigators last week. The league was looking into allegations made in a documentary by Al-Jazeera America in January. The source of those allegations, which also targeted Peyton Manning, later retracted them. The NFL said Wednesday it found “no credible evidence” that the players were guilty of any of the claims. Manning was cleared by the league earlier this summer. An NFL statement said “the investigation involved witness interviews, a review of relevant records and other materials, electronic research, and laboratory analysis and review.”

"‘House of Cards’ Makes America Grey Again With May Season 5 Premiere
Just yesterday, we confirmed that House of Cards would move from its winter perch to premiere in April or beyond, and leave it to Frank Underwood to pull focus with a dramatic announcement. Season 5 is coming in May, and the first teaser somehow manages to make America bleak again.
Just as Frank Underwood interrupted the Republican debate in 2015 to bring us word of Season 4, so too did House of Cards use the timing of Inauguration Day to confirm that Season 5 will bow on May 30. Of course, the upside-down flag, grey skies and haunting rendition of the Pledge of Allegiance don’t seem so terribly out of place anymore.
Thus far, relatively few details of House of Cards Season 5 are known, other than the announced departure of showrunner Beau Willimon, who will be succeeded by writers Frank Pugliese and Melissa James Gibson. Oscar-nominee Patricia Clarkson and Campbell Scott will guest-star in heavily-featured roles, while Season 4 additions Neve Campbell and Joel Kinnaman are also expected to return.
It’s quite a wait for House of Cards Season 5, but lord knows we’ll need a few months before political satire even comes close to relevance again. In the meantime, stay tuned for the latest.

"It can be helpful to have a discussion with your class prior to the session to get them thinking about the topic (not essential).
Encourage your class to make comments and ask questions - the session is not about right and wrong, it's a discussion where everyone's thoughts are valid. It's equally okay not to speak up during the session, as long as students are listening (we emphasise this point because some sensitive issues can come up and students may need to process these silently).
If you show enthusiasm and interest in the session, from our experience, your class will too.
Although the sessions are pre-written, we make them as interactive as possible and have the capacity to be quite responsive to students' interest/needs. There is room for students to ask questions or raise issues that are off the chosen topic (the counsellor will make sure all the necessary information is covered during the session).
Students are usually quite excited to participate in these sessions and engage very well.
However, if you notice that your class is not engaging well in the session, please feel free to signal this to the counsellor and intervene to settle the class, mediate or ""translate"" some of the ideas into language or examples that you know your class will respond to.",0.9641415476799011,259,2.6664280891418457

"We can not get enough of watching 4-year-olds, iPads in-hand, take on the role of firefighter, race car driver, a submarine captain or helicopter pilot with Happi Full Throttle. Some of the conversations that emerge sound like:
• “Get the cat with the water! It’s on fire!” – Using the Firetruck’s water feature.
• “You drive the race car and I will follow you with the helicopter” – Kids playing together, one with a toy race car the other using the helicopter.
• “Dad! I can see you.” – followed by much laughter as our little one discovered the periscope on the submarine.
Happi Full Throttle is very simple to use. Choose a vehicle and start playing. There are dynamic buttons on the screen that give kids access to the unique tools on each vehicle. While playing, kids are looking through the iPad, as the camera projects the image of whatever is in front of them on the screen. Very nice feature for safety reasons!
So where is the learning? I know you are thinking it. Especially because all of the apps we review are considered educational.
For young children, role-play is an activity that helps them develop language, vocabulary, flexibility of mind and social skills (to just name a few).
• As kids take on the role of firefighter, they are playing with the language of that role and starting on the road to developing empathy.
• When they pretend that the cat is on fire or that the couch is an apartment building, kids are creating symbolic relationships.
• The app is perfect for multiple kids to use together with the large screen of the iPad. You’ll notice how sharing and communication gets worked out in the shared experience.
Activity 1: Find the Origin
What You’ll Need:
• U.S. Map.
• Sticky notes.
Your kitchen can be an adventure in Geography. In my kitchen I can always find detergent made in Ohio, apples from Maryland, vinegar from California, olive oil from Italy and so on. You can find virtually everything (clothes, furniture, food) that enters your home with some mark telling you its origin.
Start looking at labels when you make purchases. Get a map of the US and see how long it will take you to find items in your home from each of the 50 states. For older children add continents/countries for more challenge. Ask questions to get your child thinking about the map and how people in each place play a role in making the objects in your home.
• What countries have not been labeled yet?
• Do some countries specialize in food or electronics?
• Do some states export many different things?
As you cover the map with sticky notes you may see your child developing an interest in one particular state or country. This is your chance to broaden background knowledge. Your child will realize that your town is connected to the lives of people all over the world.
Activity 2: Going on a Bear Hunt
Our family loves singing the song We’re Going on a Bear Hunt while in the car or playing in the living room. Here are some of the fun we are having with this fantastic song that I remember singing back when I was a Kindergartener.
After singing the song with our kids for a while, we found this beautiful book that illustrates the story. The kids love reading the repetitive text, including staring in the role of the “Oh, no!” readers.
Then join the Author, Michael Rosen, in acting out the story song in this YouTube video:",0.9468225836753845,755,2.497929334640503

"Research has proven that the best way to develop people is to identify the ways in which they most naturally think, feel, and behave and then build upon these elements to create strength, or the ability to provide consistent, strong performance in specific tasks and large-scale projects. The Clifton StrengthsFinder assessment serves as the foundation of any strengths-based culture, providing insight about how people can develop their talents into strengths, information managers need to understand, engage, and build upon their employees’ greatest talents, and knowledge leaders can use to create onboarding and development programs that speak directly to their employees’ most natural ways of thinking and behaving.
At the conclusion of this workshop, participants will gain knowledge and practical tools that can be immediately applied to their individual work situations, as well as a vision of the powerful productivity possible in a team that recognizes and leverages all team members’ strengths.
Please Note! A requirement of this course is to purchase StrengthsFinders 2.0, which includes a code to complete a Strength-based personal assessment. You will need to print out your full results report and bring it on the day of the workshop as the focus of the course is to develop strategies to best utilize your Top 5 Strengths. The cost is $15.

"A lot has happened in our world since the first of the year, specifically the rise in inflation and the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine. These factors can influence consumers and affect the housing and financial markets. Additionally, global unrest has had a clear influence on interest rates, driving them back down after a 1-point increase since November 2021.
Please listen to the latest video update from Windermere’s Chief Economist, Matthew Gardner (link below) that was released this Monday, 3/7/22. He provides updated insights and projections for the housing market and interest rates for 2022 and beyond, some of which have been adjusted since his January forecast.
It is always my goal to help keep my clients informed and empower strong decisions. At Windermere, we are so fortunate to have Matthew in our corner providing such expertise to help us help our clients strategically navigate the environment. Please reach out if you have any questions or if you would like to discuss how your goals relate to the market.
As Matthew stated in the video above, it is important that we keep interest rates in perspective. The chart below illustrates where rates are hovering today and where he and other experts expect to see them by the end of the year and how that affects monthly mortgage payments (principal & interest only).
We also have included the 30-year average rate to show the historical significance of today’s low rates. Even though rates have come up 1 point since the absolute bottom level in January 2021, they are still much lower than the historical average, and they are helping to offset affordability challenges.
However, at some point, rates could reach 5% which could put downward pressure on prices like the last time rates reached that level in the latter part of 2018. It is all about how the monthly payment pans out based on the rate. The variable effect of rates on prices will find its balance based on buyer appetites for monthly payment amounts.

"The K-State/KU football game the Saturday after Thanksgiving (November 26th) was selected for a 7:00 PM kickoff on Fox. If the Wildcats take care of business against West Virginia this weekend, a victory over KU would mean that K-State will face TCU in the Big 12 championship game. As fans, it’s hard not to look ahead to the KU game, but the Wildcats have to concentrate on beating the Mountaineers this weekend in order for that scenario to play out. Here is some news of the day for Wildcat fans…
JM: It’s pretty exciting that the KU game was selected for a 7:00 kick on Fox. Bill Snyder Family Stadium should be rocking for this one. A quick glance at weather.com shows a high temperature of 51 degrees and a low of 32 degrees that day. It’ll likely be a cold one whether that prediction is right or not.
JM: How would you feel about a rematch against LSU in the Sugar Bowl? LSU is a much different team this season and it would likely be a great match-up, but I’d rather have a different opponent since K-State just played them in January at the Texas Bowl.
JM: I don’t know whether this report is accurate, but I have heard that Kobe Savage is likely done for the season, which is a huge blow for the K-State secondary. I’ve heard that Martinez is still week-to-week, but if this report is accurate, Will Howard will be the starting quarterback for the rest of the regular season. Martinez could be back for the bowl game. At this time, nobody knows for sure.
JM: K-State is a 7.5 point favorite against West Virginia this Saturday. I like that point spread and I especially like that K-State is 3-1 against the spread in road games this season. I feel pretty good about a Wildcat victory against the Mountaineers.
JM: It’s nice to see that Keyontae Johnson is already getting some national publicity for his play this season. He has the potential to have a very special season.

"Suspect in Minneapolis assault has 7 previous felony convictions, got little time behind bars
[anvplayer video=”4964919″ station=”998122″]
Hennepin County prosecutors said 34-year-old Victor Childers is captured on surveillance video assaulting the owner of an auto body garage in south Minneapolis on Aug. 5.
Childers is now charged with assault, aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary connected with the incident that occurred on Chicago Avenue inside a barricaded, four-block area called, in some circles, an “autonomous zone.”
5 EYEWITNESS NEWS checked Childers’ criminal history and found he has seven prior felony convictions, two of which are considered violent offenses, between 2009 and 2018 and was released from his latest sentence in late 2019.
Police say ‘autonomous zone’ blocked emergency response to brutal assault; citizens’ group disagrees
Court records showed Childers spent under four years in jail, or prison, for those felony convictions.
Prosecutors, in charging documents, said Childers entered Mill City Auto Body and demanded money and when he did not get the money he wanted, he knocked the owner of the business unconscious.
Former Ramsey County Attorney, Susan Gaertner, told KSTP it is not “all that unusual” to have someone like Childers with multiple felony convictions, but hasn’t spent a lot of time behind bars for those offenses.
“We have, in Minnesota, one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country,” said Gaertner. “Right now, we are fourth from the bottom and we put very few Minnesota citizens in prisons compared to the rest of the country.”
Judges use a sentencing matrix laid out by the state’s Sentencing Guidelines Commission and do have limited authority to depart from those guidelines with either longer or lesser sentences under extreme circumstances.
In Childers’ cases, the sentencing judges did follow the Sentencing Guidelines, without any downward, or upward departures.
“This is done to make sure people of color are not disproportionately sentenced to longer prison time and to make sure those who don’t have the economic means to expensive counsel face the same unbalanced outcome,” said Gaertner.",0.9504371881484985,472,0.9231792092323303
"Florida communities hit three times by hurricanes grapple with how and whether to rebuild
Oct 2, 2024, 9:19 PM
(AP Photo/Kate Payne)
HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) — It was just a month ago that Brooke Hiers left the state-issued emergency trailer where her family had lived since Hurricane Idalia slammed into her Gulf Coast fishing village of Horseshoe Beach in August 2023.
Hiers and her husband Clint were still finishing the electrical work in the home they painstakingly rebuilt themselves, wiping out Clint’s savings to do so. They never will finish that wiring job.
Hurricane Helene blew their newly renovated home off its four foot-high pilings, sending it floating into the neighbor’s yard next door.
“You always think, ‘Oh, there’s no way it can happen again’,” Hiers said. “I don’t know if anybody’s ever experienced this in the history of hurricanes.”
For the third time in 13 months, this windswept stretch of Florida’s Big Bend took a direct hit from a hurricane — a one-two-three punch to a 50-mile (80-kilometer) sliver of the state’s more than 8,400 miles (13,500 kilometers) of coastline, first by Idalia, then Category 1 Hurricane Debby in August 2024 and now Helene.
Hiers, who sits on Horseshoe Beach’s town council, said words like “unbelievable” are beginning to lose their meaning.
“I’ve tried to use them all. Catastrophic. Devastating. Heartbreaking … none of that explains what happened here,” Hiers said.
The back-to-back hits to Florida’s Big Bend are forcing residents to reckon with the true costs of living in an area under siege by storms that researchers say are becoming stronger because of climate change.
The Hiers, like many others here, can’t afford homeowner’s insurance on their flood-prone houses, even if it was available. Residents who have watched their life savings get washed away multiple times are left with few choices — leave the communities where their families have lived for generations, pay tens of thousands of dollars to rebuild their houses on stilts as building codes require, or move into a recreational vehicle they can drive out of harm’s way.
That’s if they can afford any of those things. The storm left many residents bunking with family or friends, sleeping in their cars, or sheltering in what’s left of their collapsing homes.
Janalea England wasn’t waiting for outside organizations to get aid to her friends and neighbors, turning her commercial fish market in the river town of Steinhatchee into a pop-up donation distribution center, just like she did after Hurricane Idalia. A row of folding tables was stacked with water, canned food, diapers, soap, clothes and shoes, a steady stream of residents coming and going.
“I’ve never seen so many people homeless as what I have right now. Not in my community,” England said. “They have nowhere to go.”
The sparsely populated Big Bend is known for its towering pine forests and pristine salt marshes that disappear into the horizon, a remote stretch of largely undeveloped coastline that’s mostly dodged the crush of condos, golf courses and souvenir strip malls that has carved up so much of the Sunshine State.
This is a place where teachers, mill workers and housekeepers could still afford to live within walking distance of the Gulf’s white sand beaches. Or at least they used to, until a third successive hurricane blew their homes apart.
Helene was so destructive, many residents don’t have a home left to clean up, escaping the storm with little more than the clothes on their backs, even losing their shoes to the surging tides.
“People didn’t even have a Christmas ornament to pick up or a plate from their kitchen,” Hiers said. “It was just gone.”
In a place where people are trying to get away from what they see as government interference, England, who organized her own donation site, isn’t putting her faith in government agencies and insurance companies.
“FEMA didn’t do much,” she said. “They lost everything with Idalia and they were told, ‘here, you can have a loan.’ I mean, where’s our tax money going then?”
England’s sister, Lorraine Davis, got a letter in the mail just days before Helene hit declaring that her insurance company was dropping her, with no explanation other than her home “fails to meet underwriting”.
Living on a fixed income, Davis has no idea how she’ll repair the long cracks that opened up in the ceiling of her trailer after the last storm.
“We’ll all be on our own,” England said. “We’re used to it.”
In the surreal aftermath of this third hurricane, some residents don’t have the strength to clean up their homes again, not with other storms still brewing in the Gulf.
With marinas washed away, restaurants collapsed and vacation homes blown apart, many commercial fishermen, servers and housecleaners lost their homes and their jobs on the same day.
Those who worked at the local sawmill and paper mill, two bedrock employers in the area, were laid off in the past year too. Now a convoy of semi-trucks full of hurricane relief supplies have set up camp at the shuttered mill in the city of Perry.
Hud Lilliott was a mill worker for 28 years, before losing his job and now his canal-front home in Dekle Beach, just down the street from the house where he grew up.
Lilliott and his wife Laurie hope to rebuild their house there, but they don’t know how they’ll pay for it. And they’re worried the school in Steinhatchee where Laurie teaches first grade could become another casualty of the storm, as the county watches its tax base float away.
“We’ve worked our whole lives and we’re so close to where they say the ‘golden years’,” Laurie said. “It’s like you can see the light and it all goes dark.”
Dave Beamer rebuilt his home in Steinhatchee after it was “totaled” by Hurricane Idalia, only to see it washed into the marsh a year later.
“I don’t think I can do that again,” Beamer said. “Everybody’s changing their mind about how we’re going to live here.”
A waterlogged clock in a shed nearby shows the moment when time stopped, marking before Helene and after.
Beamer plans to stay in this river town, but put his home on wheels — buying a camper and building a pole barn to park it under.
In Horseshoe Beach, Hiers is waiting for a makeshift town hall to be delivered in the coming days, a double-wide trailer where they’ll offer what services they can for as long as they can. She and her husband are staying with their daughter, a 45-minute drive away.
“You feel like this could be the end of things as you knew it. Of your town. Of your community,” Hiers said. “We just don’t even know how to recover at this point.”
Hiers said she and her husband will probably buy an RV and park it where their home once stood. But they won’t be moving back to Horseshoe Beach for good until this year’s storms are done. They can’t bear to do this again.

"Darius Rucker: Grand Ole Opry Induction Made Him Feel Like Part of the Country Community
Darius Rucker had a successful run as the frontman of Hootie & the Blowfish long before he launched his career as a country music hitmaker. Although Rucker's first solo country album, Charleston, SC 1966, was successful, Rucker didn't feel as though he truly belonged until he was invited to join the Grand Ole Opry in 2012.
""I remember when I first moved to Nashville, I told my manager, ‘I want to play the Opry as much as I can.' Because Hootie tried to play the Opry, and it never worked out,"" Rucker recalled to The Boot and other reporters at a recent media event. ""My first time there was amazing; I love playing at the Opry. So the fact that it’s five years -- that moment when I got inducted into the Grand Ole Opry was the first moment that I felt like I was a part of country music: what country music is and what country music does. They need lawyers to kick me out now. That was a moment I felt like I was in.""
In addition to making country music, Rucker has also been dabbling in a few other projects, including hosting a show about golf on SiriusXM and taking a small role during an episode of Sun Records, another as a bomb-builder in Hawaii Five-0 and yet another as Jesus in CMT's Still the King; he also recently served as the voice of Thunderwing on the Nickelodeon program Blaze and the Monster Machines. For Rucker, the new opportunities became chances for him to spread his wings and try other creative endeavors.
""This year has been the year I just went for it,"" Rucker says. ""My management’s been great about it. Things come up -- they’ve been coming up for a while -- but I’m a homebody -- I don’t really like to be away from home -- but that’s my job, so I don’t really take a lot of stuff. But I just went for it ... I knew I wasn’t nobody’s [Robert] DeNiro, but I was out there having fun.""
Rucker has already accomplished more than most artists, but there is one thing he hopes to do in the near future: ""The only thing I haven’t done that I want to do is to sing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl,"" concedes Rucker.

"A lot has changed since that blog post, and I wanted to revisit the question of whether taking a second test is really worthwhile for drivers. My conclusion based on the current state of the law is that taking a second test is a foolhardy idea. It’s a trap.
At the time of my original post, the law was not consistent nor clearly articulated about whether a driver was entitled to one reliable test or two. The BC Court of Appeal has chimed in on the issue in a pair of cases, called Ucrainet and McConachie. Despite the fact that the legislation requires a police officer to have grounds to believe the result is reliable after the first test, this requirement is purely illusory: a police officer can replace defective grounds by a driver’s election to take a second test.
The Court in Ucrainet said this:
 Neither the facts in this case nor those in McConachie demonstrate a need to interpret the Act as setting up a precondition in order to address concerns about unfairness or officer misconduct. In both circumstances, the officer acted on the time estimate provided by the driver. It was not alleged that the officer was lying or acting in bad faith. The driver’s position in McConachie was that the officer failed to wait sufficient time to account for a margin of error in the driver’s estimate; and in this case, it was simply that their recollections differ as to what the driver told the officer. In neither case was there any indication that the officer thought the first test would not produce a reliable analysis. There would be nothing to gain in any event from rushing the first test since a “Fail” or “Warn” triggers the opportunity for a second test and the lower result prevails.
So taking a second test has the potential to negatively impact your case. If you got a reading that was not reliable due to operator error, malfunction, or improper maintenance of the roadside breathalyser, then you run the risk of providing confirmation of that reading by taking a second test.
Now, when I’ve made this argument in court some judges have characterized the decision not to take a second test as “game playing.” This is not so. There is no game in electing your method of challenging the prohibition. The Legislature left that open. Had they intended otherwise, they would have simply made the second test mandatory. But that remains a concern. Frankly, I think it is cynical to assume guilt and assume that a person won’t take a second test solely because they believe they are over the limit.
I also note that the limitations on disclosure and the prohibition on cross-examination function in the same way to prevent drivers from knowing whether a second test is reliable in any event. While drivers do get “calibration records” those remain undefined in the Motor Vehicle Act. In theory, a napkin with “This ASD was calibrated kthxbai” written on it would satisfy that requirement. And there is no process to compel disclosure of any calibration information the officer does not see fit to provide. Similarly, if an officer does not address certain issues related to the operation and functioning of the ASD at roadside, there is no process to ask about that. And remember, the BC Court of Appeal just totally shut down the prospect of introducing fresh evidence in the future in a review hearing.
So even those who take a second test after a first unreliable test may also get an unreliable result. And because of the inherent limitations in the system, the driver will have no way to prove that. In that regard, letting a single unreliable result stand unchallenged at the roadside is less of a risk than taking a second and potentially confirming it, or potentially getting another unreliable reading for a different reason.
After all, what are the odds that an officer who does not properly account for the elimination of residual mouth alcohol or who uses an expired device will conduct a second test by following proper procedure?
This is a tough one to wrap your head around, so strap in.
Under Section 215.42 of the Motor Vehicle Act, an officer is required to advise drivers of the right to a second test. However, the police are not obligated to advise drivers why the second test would be conducted or that a different device is to be used. The failure to provide these two pieces of information does not result in revocation of the prohibition, but it is a consideration in assessing why a driver would not take a second test. That would address the cynical view I described above about game playing. The Motor Vehicle Act also states that if an adjudicator is satisfied a driver was not advised of the right to a second test, the prohibition must be revoked.
Except that’s not actually the case.
Yes, despite plain language from the Legislature stating that if X does not happen, an adjudicator MUST revoke a prohibition, that plain language is apparently not so plain after all. Last week, the BC Court of Appeal ruled on an appeal of a case called Bisaillon that the second test information does not have to be conveyed to a driver if the driver takes a second test.
In Mr. Bisaillon’s case, he alleged that the officer forced him to take a second test. The original judge stated:
In any event, it is unclear to me why this matters. If he refused the second test on an understanding it was optional, he would still have met the criterion to get the prohibition. Thus, no beneficial consequence flows to the petitioner even if his position is accepted.
Well, as we know from the discussion above and from the Court of Appeal’s ruling in the Molberg case, the situation is a lot more nuanced than that. But nuance apparently has no place in an administrative scheme.
What this means is that if you take a second test, you are giving up an argument that you were not properly advised of your right to a second test. An entire ground upon which the prohibition can be revoked will no longer be available to you. Moreover, if you do take the second test, you compromise your chances of challenging the prohibition based on an issue of reliability. This is not to say that it’s impossible, but it becomes more difficult because instead of having to defeat one fire-breathing dragon, you’re facing off against two.
We should not be so naive as to persuade ourselves that an adjudicator will not consider a second test as evidence against a person. What I mean by this is that challenging the prohibition can become more difficult and technical where there are two results showing the same thing.
One of the defences permitted under the Motor Vehicle Act is called “evidence to the contrary.” This is essentially a person introducing evidence of what alcohol was consumed on the date in question and when, along with a scientific calculation to show that their blood alcohol concentration did not exceed the legal limit. And while there is no explicit statement in the Motor Vehicle Act to say that a person who has two test results cannot raise this defence, it becomes a lot harder when there are two tests.
Sure, I’ve won on it before. But I come at it with a lot of scientific and explanatory evidence to show why two is not always better than one. Not all lawyers, and certainly not all self-represented individuals have this.
Recent cases where that evidence was not put before the tribunal have shown that in those circumstances two tests that produce the same result may be considered to be evidence that the results were accurate, and eliminate a challenge on other grounds. After all, the adjudicator is obliged under the legislation to consider the results of both tests in weighing the evidence in the balance. So having a second test that produces the same result is akin to inviting the police to gather more incriminatory evidence.
It’s like giving a confession to murder, and then leading the police to where you hid the murder weapon.
The potential that a second device will produce a reliable reading showing that you are under the limit and allowing you to go free has to be weighed against these huge consequences in taking a second test. And from my perspective, there is very little to be gained and a lot to be lost by taking a second test.
Which is why it is my belief that a second test is a trap and that drivers should not take the second test.",0.9720816016197205,1720,1.1600958108901978

"We’ve put the Parsley back in our Health Greens!
For finicky birds who don’t like
While most finches relish fresh greens, many Gouldian owners know that this is not always the case for their birds. Our dried Health Greens provide many of the same benefits as their fresh counterpart and are readily accepted by most finches. My Gouldians love it and eagerly fly to the dish before my hand is out of the enclosure!
The health benefits of alfalfa have been known for centuries dating back to ancient Greece. They used alfalfa to treat a variety of diseases including bladder and kidney conditions. Traditional Chinese medicine uses alfalfa to treat kidney stones. Alfalfa has been used as a human food and herbal medicine for at least 1500 years.
Alfalfa contains vitamins (A, E, B6, K and D), minerals (calcium, iron, manganese, potassium, phosphorus, chlorine, sodium and magnesium) and contains more protein than beef, eggs and milk. It contains many essential enzymes and aids in digestion.
The high nutritional value of parsley comes from its vitamin A and vitamin C content. Parsley contains twice as much iron as spinach and it is a good source of manganese, calcium and potassium. Parsley is one of the most important herbs for providing vitamins to the body. It’s like an immune-enhancing multi-vitamin and mineral complex in green plant form. It grows in most climates and is readily available throughout the year.
Parsley has also been used by both Chinese and German herbalists to enhance the kidney’s ability to excrete sodium and water, so parsley acts as a natural diuretic. Our mixture of parley to alfalfa is therefore 1 part parsley to 5 parts alfalfa, so your bird does not get enough parsley to cause dehydration.

"It's been said before, but I'll say it again because it's true—children are like sponges! If you have little kids at home, you probably spend half of your day trying to answer their probing questions. ""What are clouds made of?"" ""How do leaves change color?"" ""Why do puddles disappear?"" While being bombarded with questions day after day may make you want to throw your hands over your ears or pack a bag and run for the hills, its kids' innate curiosity that drives their learning. And who are we to squash their desire to learn about the world around them? After all, some poor sap put up with our never-ending questions when we were little, right? Even if we don't have all the answers, we can still encourage learning by doing fun experiments with them that expose them to new things and challenge their thinking. For these fun science experiments, we're taking learning outside and using Mother Nature as our classroom. Watch your child's curiosity blossom as you make your way through these quick, easy experiments!
S'more Science Please!
The perfect science experiment for a camping vacation, this one is fun AND yummy! There's a huge, ooey-gooey reward at the end of this experiment if done right, so pay close attention!
- X-acto knife
- Clean, empty pizza box
- Aluminum foil
- Clear plastic wrap
- Clear tape
- S'mores ingredients (graham crackers, chocolate bars, marshmallows)
- In the top lid of the pizza box, cut a square flap that lifts up on the two sides and across the front but is still attached near the back side of the box.
- Cover the inside of the flap with aluminum foil. Also spread aluminum foil on the inside of the pizza box (on the bottom, where you'll set your s'mores).
- Cover the hole you've cut with clear plastic wrap. Use tape to secure it if needed.
- Make the s'mores and set them on the inside of the pizza box (on the foil). You can try this two ways to see how it works best for you: fully assemble them as if they're ready to bite into, or leave them face open so that the marshmallows and chocolate can melt separately before you assemble them.
- Pull the top of the box down all the way so that your s'mores are covered by the clear plastic wrap.
- Using a stick found around your camper or house, prop open the foil flap so that the sun can radiate off of the aluminum foil.
- Now ... wait! A watched s'more never melts, so go play some camping games or load up on wet wipes while the sun works its magic in your solar s'more oven! Don't worry, it'll be s'more time in no time!
This is probably one of the easiest and most interesting science experiments you can do with your kids, and all you need is a stick of sidewalk chalk, a warm body, and a sunny day. Save this experiment for a day when full sun is forecasted for the whole day, otherwise you'll have to scrap your experiment and start over if it gets cloudy. To teach your kids how the Earth rotates around the sun (and not the other way around) and how shadows move based on the location of the sun, follow these directions to make a human sundial.
- Locate a wide-open cement space that won't become shaded by a tree or building (backyard basketball court, driveway, playground, etc.). Draw a large circle and put an X right in the middle of it. Label the circle to show North, East, South, and West.
- Have your child stand on the X. You or a sibling then traces their shadow on the ground with the chalk. Write the time of day inside the shadow.
- Repeat Step 2 every couple of hours, writing the corresponding times in the shadows. Ask your child to predict where their next shadow might fall.
See It To Believe It!
Step outside and listen closely. Do you hear that? Can you hear the leaves breathing? No, neither can I. But they are—we just can't see it or hear it. This fun experiment aims to prove that just because we can't see something doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.
- Bowl that has a larger diameter than your leaf (preferably glass)
- Small rock
- Head outside and grab a leaf right off of a tree. Don't use a dead one off the ground. It needs to be alive in order for this experiment to work.
- Fill your bowl most of the way with water. Lay your leaf on top of the water and place your rock on it so that it sinks down into the water.
- Find a sunny place in your home or RV to set the bowl. Let it bask in the sun for half the day before coming back to check on it. Go for a hike or head to the beach while you wait ... it makes the time go by faster!
- When you return to your leaf, ask your kids what they see. At this point there should be zillions of tiny bubbles in the water and all around on the leaf. Ok, maybe not zillions, but there'll be a lot of them all over in the bowl. Depending on the ages of your kids, they'll either figure out that the bubbles are little pockets of oxygen that the leaf is expelling during the photosynthesis process, or you can explain that a leaf ""breathes"" out oxygen just like we do, and these bubbles are proof of that.
Make It Go BOOM!
When you mix ingredients and the reaction is an explosive one, it's guaranteed to be a hit! That's why this experiment landed on my list of fun outdoor science experiments that I think your kids will love! And you'll love that it uses household ingredients easily found in your pantry. BONUS: if you're near a beach, use sand and a beach pail instead of play dough and a film canister.
- Baking soda
- Play dough (or sand)
- Small film canister w/o the top (or beach pail)
- Measuring cup
- If doing this experiment in your driveway, on a sidewalk, or at your campsite, lay newspaper down for easy clean up later.
- Have your child set the canister or pail on the ground with the open end facing up. Form the play dough or sand around the canister or pail so that they create a volcano shape. The only part of the canister or pail that should be visible is the opening.
- Once your child is happy with the shape of the volcano, it's time to make it go BOOM! Tip: if you're using a pail, fill it half way with sand and pack it down so that you won't have to use as much baking soda and vinegar.
- There's really no set ratio of baking soda to vinegar, so just start experimenting with amounts. Pour some baking soda into the volcano and then pour vinegar on top until it erupts and runs down the side of the volcano.
- If the explosion wasn't as epic as you wanted, try adding more vinegar the next time you do it. You should be able to repeat it a few times before the volcano is worn out.

"Language Fundamentals leadership recently took part in a Medicare training session led by Alicia Cantinieri of Zimmet Healthcare Services Group. Alicia provided an informative & interactive seminar that included the most important SNF Industry Medicare updates.
Among the important topics covered were:
Importance of Accurate Diagnosis Coding – Under PDPM accuracy of primary and secondary diagnosis is paramount. Refining systems for accurate diagnosis coding is highly recommended.
Upcoming changes regarding NYS Case Mix – The system for MDS Case Mix in New York State is in need of an update. Section G of the OBRA assessment is scheduled to be eliminated in October 2023. This will affect the calculation of a RUG-III score in states like New York that rely on this information. Solutions include implementing an Optional State Assessment or using PDPM. No clarification has been provided yet.
BIMS – It is important to have documentation as to why a BIMS is repeated on a patient. Surveyors do frequently ask for the patient’s most recent BIMS. Additionally, CMS has the ability to perform targeted audits based on BIMS scores.
Skilled Care & Documentation – The technical definition of skilled care has not changed. 7 days of skilled nursing care or 5 days of skilled rehab. It is important to remember the criteria with regard to the plan of treatment. Documentation that supports the skilled intervention by a licensed professional (RN, PT, OT, SLP) is critical to protect from a poor audit result.
Accuracy of MDS information – MDS information is also used in many avenues, including QM, 5-star, care compare, legal cases, and more. Therefore, the impact of the MDS accurately reflecting the clinical condition of the resident is more important than ever.
SLP Component – coding SLP-related comorbidities is an area where many SNFs miss reimbursement opportunities. Having expertise in the PDPM Assessment of the SLP Component will prevent lost reimbursement.
Claim Denials – According to ZHSG, the most common reasons for denied claims include:
- Clinical Eligibility (7 day/week: Nursing, 5/Therapy)
- Nursing RUG drivers and “end splits”
- Nursing documentation must support all drivers
- Speech variables
- Function scoring / Variance from Section G
- NTA drivers: Medical necessity, administration, documentation
- ICD‐10 assignment or omission
While we understand that SNF operators are now heavily focused on staffing issues, Medicare audits primarily related to the 1135 waiver are likely to have negative implications. It is important to dedicate resources and attention to the accuracy of reimbursement and supportive documentation.
If you have any questions about how to improve the accuracy of reimbursement at your SNF, especially the speech component, please don’t hesitate to contact us.",0.9289095401763916,583,1.3259354829788208

"In recent years, the real estate and construction industries have been rapidly evolving with new technologies and methods designed to make building projects faster, more sustainable, and more cost-effective. One such innovation making waves in estate development is precast construction, which has become a game changer for organizations like Estate Nirman Nigam (ENN). This blog post delves into the impact of precast construction on estate development, exploring its advantages, challenges, and future prospects.
What is Precast Construction?
Precast construction refers to a construction method in which building components such as walls, beams, columns, slabs, and even entire modules are produced in a controlled factory environment and then transported to the construction site for assembly. Unlike traditional construction, which involves pouring concrete at the site, precast construction enables standardized, high-quality components to be created with greater speed and precision. This process can involve a range of materials, but concrete is the most commonly used due to its durability, versatility, and ease of production.
Precast construction is not a new concept; it has been in practice for decades in various parts of the world. However, the method has gained momentum in recent years, thanks to advancements in technology, improved material quality, and the increasing need for more sustainable construction practices.
The Role of Estate Nirman Nigam
Estate Nirman Nigam, a government body or a public sector entity in certain countries, is responsible for planning, developing, and managing real estate projects that often include housing, office spaces, and community facilities. With the growing population and rapid urbanization, ENN has needed to adopt innovative solutions that can handle the demands of modern urban planning, while still maintaining cost efficiency and quality. Precast construction has emerged as a promising solution for estate development projects handled by ENN.
Advantages of Precast Construction for Estate Nirman Nigam
1. Speed of Construction
One of the most significant advantages of precast construction is the speed at which it can be executed. Precasting components in a factory setting allows them to be produced simultaneously with site preparation work. This parallel workflow can significantly cut down the overall construction timeline, allowing for faster project completion and quicker occupancy of buildings. For ENN, faster construction means more housing units, commercial spaces, or community facilities can be delivered to the public more efficiently.
2. Improved Quality Control
Precast components are manufactured in a controlled factory environment, where factors such as temperature, humidity, and mixing ratios can be carefully monitored. This leads to a higher degree of consistency and quality in the final products. Traditional on-site construction, in contrast, can be impacted by weather conditions and other environmental variables, which can compromise the quality of the finished structure.
For ENN, maintaining high standards of quality in public sector housing and development projects is essential for ensuring safety and long-term durability. Precast construction makes it easier to uphold these standards without the variability of on-site conditions.
While the initial investment in precast technology and factory setup may be high, the long-term savings can be substantial. Faster construction leads to reduced labor costs, as the amount of on-site work is significantly less. Additionally, since the production process is streamlined and more efficient, material wastage is minimized. Over time, these factors contribute to cost savings that can be redirected into other aspects of the project or into more affordable housing solutions.
4. Sustainability and Reduced Environmental Impact
Precast construction is also more environmentally friendly than traditional methods. Since components are produced in a factory, material waste can be minimized and recycling can be implemented more effectively. Moreover, with the ability to use efficient manufacturing processes, the carbon footprint of precast construction can be significantly lower than conventional construction. ENN can promote green building practices by adopting precast technology, aligning with sustainable development goals and policies aimed at reducing the environmental impact of construction.
5. Enhanced Safety
Working in a factory environment reduces the risks associated with construction sites, such as worker falls, equipment accidents, and exposure to hazardous weather conditions. Precast construction minimizes the amount of on-site work needed, thus reducing the risk of accidents and improving overall site safety. For ENN, prioritizing the safety of workers and reducing the risk of costly delays due to workplace accidents is essential.
6. Versatility and Customization
Precast components can be customized to meet specific design requirements and aesthetic preferences. From intricate architectural details to various finishes and textures, precast construction provides a wide range of options for creating visually appealing structures. This adaptability allows ENN to deliver unique and modern developments that cater to the diverse needs of urban populations.
Challenges Faced by Estate Nirman Nigam in Precast Construction
While the benefits are numerous, the integration of precast construction into estate development is not without challenges. These challenges include:
1. High Initial Investment
One of the major barriers to adopting precast construction is the high initial cost of setting up a precast factory and the necessary machinery. This investment can be daunting for organizations like ENN, which must balance budget considerations while still delivering quality projects. However, these costs can be offset over time through faster project completion and reduced labor expenses.
2. Transportation and Logistics
Precast components must be transported from the factory to the construction site, which can pose logistical challenges. Issues such as traffic congestion, road infrastructure, and the need for specialized transportation equipment can complicate this process. ENN needs to carefully plan the transportation logistics to avoid delays and damage during transit.
3. Skilled Labor Requirements
Precasting technology requires specialized knowledge and training for both factory production and site assembly. This need for skilled labor can sometimes be a limitation, as training programs and experienced workers may be in short supply. ENN would need to invest in training programs to ensure the availability of skilled workers who can handle the different stages of precast construction effectively.
4. Design Limitations
While precast construction offers a high degree of flexibility, certain complex designs or highly customized features can be challenging to execute with precast components. This can sometimes limit the architectural creativity and adaptability needed for certain projects. ENN would need to strike a balance between creative design and the practical limitations of precast construction.
5. Regulatory Challenges
In some regions, regulations and building codes may not yet fully accommodate precast construction techniques. Compliance with local rules and standards may require additional approvals or adaptations to the process, which can delay projects and increase costs.
The Future of Precast Construction in Estate Nirman Nigam
Despite the challenges, the future of precast construction in estate development looks promising for Estate Nirman Nigam. As technology advances and new construction techniques emerge, these barriers are likely to be addressed. Here are a few trends that could shape the future:
1. Advancements in Technology
Technological innovations such as 3D printing and automated machinery in precast factories are making the process even more efficient and cost-effective. This will likely reduce the cost and time associated with setting up precast facilities and improve the quality of the components produced.
2. Improved Transport Solutions
With innovations in transport and logistics, the challenges of moving large precast elements from factories to sites will be addressed more effectively. The use of specialized transportation solutions, smart traffic management, and logistical planning software will facilitate smoother operations.
3. Government Support and Policy Changes
Governments may start to promote precast construction through subsidies or incentives, recognizing the long-term benefits it brings to urban development. For ENN, this could mean more funding and resources to incorporate precast technology into its projects.
4. Hybrid Construction Models
The future of precast construction may not be an all-or-nothing approach. Instead, a hybrid model that combines precast components with traditional construction methods could become more common. This model allows for faster completion while still accommodating unique design needs and site-specific challenges.
Precast construction represents a significant shift in how estate development projects are managed by Estate Nirman Nigam. Its advantages in speed, quality, cost savings, and sustainability make it an appealing choice for modern construction projects. However, to fully capitalize on these benefits, ENN will need to navigate the challenges associated with high initial costs, transportation logistics, and regulatory hurdles.
As technology continues to evolve and the demand for urban housing and infrastructure grows, precast construction is set to play a larger role in the future of estate development. By investing in innovative practices, adopting new technologies, and focusing on training and development, ENN can harness the full potential of precast construction to deliver modern, high-quality, and sustainable living spaces for the public.",0.9369314908981323,1757,2.4015543460845947

"Bestselling Author/Designer James Farmer Comes to the Lowcountry
Interview by Mark Shaffer
Photos courtesy of James Farmer
Sea Island Garden Club brings internationally known lifestyle expert and author James Farmer to the Dataw Club Tuesday, November 4th. A native of Kathleen, Georgia, Farmer’s authored a number of bestselling books including A Time To Plant, Sip & Savor, Porch Living, A Time to Cook, and Dinner on the Grounds. He is also an editor-at-large for Southern Living Magazine and has been featured on NBC TODAY, HGTV Gardens, Paula’s Home Cooking, as well as in Harper’s Bazaar, Good Housekeeping Magazine and Woman’s Day. According to jamesfarmer.com his “love of Southern food and cooking have put him at the forefront of the garden-to-table lifestyle. James was taught as a young boy how to pull vegetables, herbs and flowers from the family farm and kitchen garden to provide much of the food, decor and flavor of his family’s everyday life.” I spoke to him by phone from his design and antique store in downtown Perry, Georgia.
Mark Shaffer: How did growing up in a small southern town influence your work?
James Farmer: I still live in that same small town where I grew up, so “influence” is a key word. It’s very much the present tense. There’s a charm that some small southern towns just portray naturally. The way we as southerners decorate our homes and entertain our families and friends is a natural extension of our personas. People like my mother and my grandmother – great entertainers – really set the bar for where I wanted to be.
MS: No one entertains like southerners.
JF: That’s the truth.
MS: Why is that? What’s different?
JF: I think we entertain and treat our guests as if they were family. My grandmother always told me that it was an honor and a privilege to have people at your table. She felt the honor was more service minded, that she was able to serve people body and soul when they were at her table. It’s a sense of humility and at the same time it’s a direct representation of our hospitality.
MS: So your grandmother was a huge influence, as well. Tell me about her.
JF: She grew up in a town not far from here and she grew up with a huge family all around so that any dinner was a familial affair.
She also taught me that we eat with our eyes first. Before we take that first bite we sort of have that first visual feast. She also insisted that what was in season, what was ripe and fresh and local was best. It didn’t matter who was coming to dinner that influenced the menu so much as the time of year they were coming to dinner that determined what we had.
MS: Which brings us to the subject of Farm to Table. These days it’s called a “movement.” We both remember it was just what people did: grow food and eat seasonally. Where are we with this? Is it a fad or are we returning to this as a way of life.
JF: Well, it’s definitely not a fad in the South; it’s a way of life. It’s definitely in vogue to know where your food comes from. My grandfather said something funny at dinner the other night. I was telling him about one of my recent trips to a city somewhere and eating at a farm-to-table restaurant there. And he laughed and said, “If I’d known that eating like poor southern people was going to be all the rage I’d have grown more collards.”
This is a Southern renaissance in the sense that the South just like any region or culture has a history, but there’s a way in which we celebrate and portray it that’s just pretty special.
MS: There seems to be no end to the nation’s fascination with Southern food . . .
MS: I mean they’re serving boiled peanuts in swanky Manhattan bars. Why is this such a phenomenon?
JF: I think a lot of it has to do with the simple connection of the food to the farm. You ask someone outside of the South for a recipe and they’ll tell you how many cups of sugar and sticks of butter to use. You ask a Southerner, you get a recipe and a story. And that to me makes it exciting that Southern food is in vogue and for me it’s a privilege and honor to tout that.
MS: Eating seasonally in the South, what are four things that spring to mind?
JF: Well, for me it’s what I can grow myself rather than depending on a major farm for. And here’s what’s funny about southerners: in the garden we grow vegetables but we grow flowers in the yard.
MS: This is true.
JF: We’re coming into fall and I’m thinking about collards and mustard and kale and all these wonderful greens. I have pecans in the wintertime. So, for me with each season it’s all about what I can grow, whether it’s a flower to go on my table, the fruits and vegetables I eat or a pot of rosemary at my back door. A small garden can still feed Pharaoh’s army.
MS: Is there a particular dish that takes you right back to childhood, something that sort of defines you in a way?
JF: I think my quintessential meal that warms me inside out and sort of feeds my soul as well is what I call my birthday dinner. My grandmother and Miss Mary, who’s cooked for our family for three generations, have cooked this for years and years.
My birthday’s in June so they fry chicken, which is year round for us, but I always have lady peas. I love lady peas. They’re in middle June. And then there’s okra and tomatoes over rice and that combination with the peas and sautéed squash and biscuits and some kind of peach cobbler. Every bit of it is very, very hyper seasonal. It’s not just “oh, the tomatoes are in,” maybe it’s more about the Brandywines or the Cherokee Purples or other heirlooms. Or it could be about those white peaches that come in mid summer and make such great cobbler. I joke that when we enter the Pearly Gates it’s going to smell like peas simmering on the stove.
MS: Suddenly I’m very hungry.
MS: Peas notwithstanding, you’re sort of famous for throwing a party. What is a James Farmer party like?
JF: First off, it’s fun, and I hope no one leaves hungry or bored. It goes back to what my grandmother taught me about feeding people body and soul while they’re at my table. I want my parties to be an extension of spending time with my family and me. You’re going to hear great stories eat great food that’s very seasonally appropriate. A James Farmer party? (Laughs) I love them, because they’re just as much fun for me and I love to watch people be a bit surprised. And it’s a little bit comforting and relaxing, too.
MS: You’ve got a sister in Bluffton. Have you had much experience with Lowcountry landscapes?
JF: Yes, I have. My sister’s a photographer and she’s photographed four of my books. She’s been a great help to me. We grew up going to the Georgia coast and St. Simons, sort of the tale end of the Lowcountry proper. When she moved to Bluffton no one shed a tear because we all get to go visit in Bluffton.
I did a book on porches and a number of the porches in that book are Lowcountry porches. I absolutely love the Lowcountry. I just built a home on my family’s land here and a friend gave what I thought was the greatest compliment. She said, “James your house looks like you took Bluffton and Cashiers and they had a baby.” Cashiers, North Carolina, is another one of my favorite places. And I thought, yes! That’s what I wanted.
MS: Porch living is indeed a very southern thing; it’s part of our culture.
JF: It sure is.
MS: You’re coming to Dataw for a talk and you’re going to have a lot of people who’ve moved here from outside of the South and want to know how to live more like Southerners. I’m sure you get this a lot.
JF: I do. I actually find it flattering that they all chose to leave the cold and the snow. I feel like Ohio’s got no one left. They’ve all moved to Hilton Head.
I look at it as a flattering thing that they want to be here. Sure, the climate’s nice, but the food ain’t bad, either. And hopefully they’ll learn to eat grits –
(Both laugh) – Salting them first, of course.

"Definition: *An apparent literal 'de█th sentence' or decree for the Babylonian Kabbalist crime of subverting the organization via non-overt methods the organization itself trains rank-and-file personnel to deploy, or sometimes more particularly of subverting the prevalent recognition of Divine Will principles within the organization (such as by not clearly announcing when a counter-Divine Will basis is being adopted or deployed, for example). Appears to be frequently-used with supposed 'inversion' symbols and modes to reference either kindness (as in, the opposite of literal 'de█th' to someone) or a statement of intent to uphold Divine Will principles (or at least keep the transgressions against them clearly-del█neated)
That is the definition I've been able to infer from context and usage. It appears to have something to do with their Tar█t c█rds using the literal 'De█th' c█rd to instead refer to literal 'ch█nge', and thereby intimate the usage of the [ch█nge] symbol as referencing literal de█th.
Whatever else can accurately be said about the organization, it does appear to insist that humanity's access to knowledge about Divine Will principles remains (at least to non-overtly aware personnel) clear via its protocol of clearly non-overtly announcing via symbolism whenever personnel are violating them. With [m█sk] when Choosing to act contrary to their own True Nature for example, or p█wder when they deliberately commit a lapse of integrity, various counter-Divine Will symbols when they've Chosen to adopt such a position and so on. Consider how the knowledge about Divine Will principles would be collectively lost if such declarations weren't made, and perhaps more cynically, the internal loss of personnel loyalty among the rank-and-file which would be the direct consequence of that.
For an organization which specializes in training personnel to learn and deploy non-overt methods of subversion, usually incremental subversion, it does seem to have distinct reservations about any of its own methods being deployed against itself. Seems rather a do█ble-stand█rd perhaps.
I've also noticed that this apparent prevalent usage of their [ch█nge] symbol appears itself to be a violation on its own terms. Consider: Given that Divine Will is the Ultimate Authority, who specifically approved the Babylonian Kabbalist policy of tolerating and deeming acceptable all manner of violations and transgressions against it, so long as the offender plainly announced them as the appropriate transgressions while they were committing them? It would be like r█bbery being state-approved just so long as while you were doing it, you loudly yelled, 'I'm committing a r█bbery!' to everyone in the general vicinity. What's more, given that Divinely-conferred rights are conferred by the Greatest Authority by definition, who among us could poss█bly have gained the authority to approve their violation? Such an individual by definition would have to be making the implicit and rather arrogant claim on having the Greatest Authority, that of our Divine Creator and indeed superior to It, and in that they would themselves be committing the same transgression which the [ch█nge] symbol appears to reference.
In making a distinction between 'Divine Will principles in theory' and 'allowable transgressions against it in actual practice', the policy of the Babylonian Kabbalists would appear to have applied their own bl█de symbolic concept to relegate Divine Will Authority and Divinely-conferred rights to the merely hypothetical, while blatantly, routinely, systematically and rather blithely disregarding them everywhere else while giving what's colloquially referred to as 'l█p service' to them. Can't have it both w█ys, retaining the respectability of upholding Divine Will principles while systematically violating them. Nevertheless the Babylonian Kabbalists as an organization do appear to try.

"Our CSR Manager, Charlotte Wright, joined our team of volunteers at Refettorio Felix, here she explains what they got up to…
Last week, two of our young apprentice chefs, Louisa and Sam, took a day out of their busy schedule to volunteer with Refettorio Felix, a vibrant community kitchen and drop in centre in Earls Court, part of the Food for Soul project.
Refettorio Felix offers a lunchtime food service with a difference to vulnerable members of the community, creating delicious three-course meals from surplus ingredients sourced through the Felix Project that would otherwise be wasted.
Louisa & Sam arrived to find an amazing array of fresh and seasonal produce that had been donated that morning. The challenge being; to plan a three course lunch for the day ahead by using the ingredients in front of them. They quickly set to work with the help of Elior’s Development Chefs Mark Crowe, Stuart Nesbit and Ian Smith.
So, what was created?
Late spring salad; grilled asparagus, courgettes and peppers with guacasaca (avocado sauce) and peppermint.
Braised beef meatballs with a tomato and herb sauce, cauliflower couscous and pickled veg salad.
Baked aubergine with caponata
Orange drizzle cake with frozen chocolate mousse, popped corn & crushed chocolate florentines
Our front of house volunteer, Mikaela, from a prestigious City law firm, provided service with a smile! The vibrant and beautiful space came alive, whilst volunteer staff buzzed around serving the dishes as they came freshly plated out of the kitchen.
This is food that many would pay for as a treat on date night! It’s hard to believe that it was made using surplus ingredients that would have otherwise been wasted, and the guests are able to enjoy not just a delicious meal but for many, the only meal they may have that day.
As well as providing a transformative lunch service, the centre offers counselling sessions, washing facilities, housing and job searching assistance and structured creative activities.
By infusing the Refettorio with art and design, and wonderful food, the aim is to engage guests in a holistic approach to nourishment; feeding both the body and soul.
It’s such an exciting and valuable project to be a part of – we’re looking forward to working more with Refettorio in the future.",0.9582263231277466,502,1.1940157413482666
"Travel Abroad Tips: Embarking on an international adventure requires meticulous planning and preparation. This guide delves into every aspect of your journey, from pre-trip essentials like visa applications and packing strategies to navigating foreign cultures and managing your finances responsibly. We’ll cover budgeting techniques, health and safety precautions, efficient transportation methods, and smart communication strategies, ensuring a smooth and enriching experience abroad.
Whether you’re a seasoned traveler or embarking on your first international trip, understanding the nuances of navigating a foreign country is key to a successful and enjoyable experience. This comprehensive guide offers practical advice and insightful tips to help you overcome common challenges and fully immerse yourself in the wonders of international travel.
Thorough pre-trip planning is crucial for a smooth and enjoyable travel experience. Careful consideration of packing, itinerary, visa requirements, and insurance ensures you’re well-prepared for any eventuality, minimizing stress and maximizing your enjoyment. This section Artikels key steps to ensure a successful trip.
Packing List, Travel Abroad Tips
A well-organized packing list prevents overpacking and ensures you have everything you need. Categorizing items makes packing and unpacking efficient.
- Clothing: Pack versatile items that can be mixed and matched. Consider the climate and planned activities. Include comfortable walking shoes, appropriate outerwear, and any specific clothing needed for planned activities (e.g., hiking boots, swimwear).
- Toiletries: Pack travel-sized toiletries to comply with airline regulations. Include essential items like toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, soap, sunscreen, and any personal medications.
- Electronics: Bring necessary electronics such as a phone, charger, adapter (if needed), camera, and any other devices you require. Consider bringing portable power banks for extended use.
- Documents: This is arguably the most important category. Include passport (with at least six months validity remaining), visa (if required), flight/train tickets, hotel confirmations, travel insurance information, copies of important documents (stored separately from originals), and any necessary health records or prescriptions.
Sample 7-Day Itinerary
This is a sample itinerary and should be adjusted to suit individual preferences and destinations.
Day | Activity |
1 | Arrive at destination, check into hotel, explore local neighborhood. |
2 | Sightseeing: Visit major historical landmarks or museums. |
3 | Cultural experience: Attend a local event, cooking class, or traditional performance. |
4 | Relaxation: Enjoy a spa treatment, visit a park, or simply relax by the pool. |
5 | Day trip to a nearby town or attraction. |
6 | Shopping and souvenir hunting. |
7 | Depart from destination. |
Obtaining Travel Visas and Vaccinations
Visa requirements vary depending on your citizenship and destination. Check the specific requirements of your destination country well in advance of your trip. Many countries require visa applications to be submitted weeks or even months before travel. Similarly, necessary vaccinations depend on your destination and your health history. Consult your doctor or a travel clinic at least six to eight weeks before your trip to determine which vaccinations are recommended or required.
Travel Insurance Comparison
Travel insurance offers protection against unforeseen circumstances. Different policies offer varying levels of coverage. Compare options based on your needs and budget. Consider factors such as medical emergencies, trip cancellations, lost luggage, and personal liability. For example, some policies offer comprehensive coverage including emergency medical evacuation, while others may only cover basic medical expenses. It’s vital to carefully review the policy details before purchasing.
Budgeting and Finances: Travel Abroad Tips
Planning your finances is crucial for a smooth and enjoyable trip abroad. Careful budgeting ensures you can fully experience your destination without the stress of unexpected expenses or running out of money. This section will guide you through strategies for saving money, managing your funds, and mitigating financial risks during your travels.
Saving Money on Flights and Accommodation
Finding affordable flights and accommodation can significantly impact your overall travel budget. Websites like Skyscanner and Google Flights allow you to compare prices from various airlines and travel agencies, often revealing significant savings. Consider traveling during the off-season or shoulder season for lower prices on flights and accommodation. Booking flights and accommodation well in advance can also secure better deals. For accommodation, explore options beyond traditional hotels, such as hostels, guesthouses, Airbnb, or VRBO for potentially lower costs and unique experiences. Flexibility with your travel dates can also lead to considerable savings.
Managing Finances While Traveling Abroad
Effective financial management while abroad requires preparation and discipline. Before your trip, inform your bank and credit card companies of your travel dates and destinations to avoid any issues with card usage. Consider using a budgeting app like Mint or YNAB (You Need A Budget) to track your spending in real-time. These apps help monitor expenses, set spending limits, and provide visual representations of your budget. Regarding currency exchange, it’s generally advisable to exchange a small amount of local currency before departure for immediate needs upon arrival. However, avoid exchanging large sums at airports or tourist exchange bureaus due to higher fees. Using your debit card for purchases directly in local currency (with your bank’s exchange rate) often provides better rates than exchanging cash beforehand. Notify your bank of your travel plans to prevent any card blocks.
Financial Risks and Mitigation Strategies
Travel abroad presents potential financial risks, including theft and scams. To mitigate theft, avoid displaying large amounts of cash and keep valuables secure, preferably in a money belt or hidden pouch. Photocopy important documents such as your passport and driver’s license and store them separately from the originals. Be wary of scams, especially those involving overly friendly strangers or unexpected requests for money. Research common scams in your destination country before your trip to be better prepared. Travel insurance can provide financial protection against unforeseen circumstances such as lost luggage, medical emergencies, or trip cancellations.
Sample Budget Breakdown: 10-Day Trip to Italy
This sample budget provides a general estimate for a 10-day trip to Italy. Remember that actual costs can vary depending on your travel style and choices.
Item | Category | Estimated Cost (€) | Actual Cost (€) |

Health and Safety
Traveling abroad opens up a world of exciting experiences, but it’s crucial to prioritize your health and safety to ensure a smooth and enjoyable trip. Proper planning and preparedness can significantly reduce risks and allow you to focus on exploring your destination. This section details essential precautions to take before, during, and after your international travels.
Travel Health Precautions and Vaccinations
Prior to your departure, consulting your physician or a travel clinic is paramount. They can advise on necessary vaccinations based on your destination and itinerary. Many countries require proof of certain vaccinations for entry, and failing to comply can result in denied entry or quarantine. Beyond required vaccinations, your doctor can recommend preventative medications for common illnesses prevalent in your destination, such as malaria prophylaxis or typhoid fever vaccinations. It’s also advisable to discuss any pre-existing medical conditions and obtain necessary prescriptions, ensuring you have enough medication for the entire trip plus a few extra days in case of delays. Remember to pack all medications in their original containers with labels clearly visible.
Common Health Risks in Different Regions and Preventative Measures
Health risks vary significantly depending on your destination. For example, regions with tropical climates may pose a higher risk of mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus. Preventative measures include using insect repellent with DEET, wearing long sleeves and pants in the evenings, and sleeping under mosquito nets. In areas with poor sanitation, travelers face a heightened risk of gastrointestinal illnesses. Practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands frequently with soap and water or using hand sanitizer, and avoiding uncooked food or contaminated water, is vital. Other risks may include altitude sickness in mountainous regions, requiring gradual acclimatization, and heatstroke in hot climates, necessitating staying hydrated and avoiding strenuous activity during the hottest parts of the day. Consulting resources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for specific region-based health advisories is highly recommended.
Strategies for Staying Safe While Traveling Abroad
Personal security and awareness of local customs are essential for a safe trip. Before you leave, research your destination’s local laws and customs to avoid unintentional offenses. Register with your embassy or consulate; this allows them to contact you in emergencies. Keep copies of important documents, such as your passport and travel insurance information, separate from the originals. Avoid displaying expensive jewelry or electronics, and be mindful of your surroundings, particularly at night or in crowded areas. It’s advisable to use reputable transportation services and avoid walking alone in poorly lit or isolated areas. Learn a few basic phrases in the local language; this can be helpful in emergencies and demonstrates respect for the local culture. Trust your instincts; if a situation feels unsafe, remove yourself from it.
Emergency Contact Numbers and Resources for Travelers
Having a readily accessible list of emergency contact numbers is crucial. This should include the local emergency number (often 911 equivalents vary by country), your country’s embassy or consulate number, and the contact information for your travel insurance provider. Additionally, consider downloading relevant travel apps that provide real-time safety information, translation services, and emergency assistance features. The CDC website, your country’s foreign affairs ministry website, and your travel insurance provider’s website are all valuable resources for up-to-date travel advisories and emergency assistance information. Familiarize yourself with these resources before your trip to ensure you can access them easily if needed.
Cultural Awareness and Etiquette
Embarking on international travel offers a unique opportunity for enriching cultural exchange. However, a successful trip hinges not only on meticulous planning but also on a deep respect for the local customs and traditions of your destination. Understanding and adhering to cultural norms demonstrates consideration, fosters positive interactions, and enhances your overall travel experience. Ignoring these nuances can, conversely, lead to misunderstandings and even offense.
Respecting local customs and traditions is paramount for a positive travel experience. Cultural sensitivity goes beyond simply being polite; it’s about demonstrating genuine appreciation for the unique values and practices of a community. This involves acknowledging the historical context of those customs, and understanding the significance they hold for the local population. Such respect often translates into more meaningful and enriching interactions with the local people.
Common Cultural Faux Pas to Avoid
Failing to understand local customs can lead to unintentional offenses. For example, in some cultures, direct eye contact might be considered disrespectful, while in others, it’s a sign of honesty and engagement. Similarly, the use of personal space varies greatly across cultures. What might be considered a friendly distance in one country could be perceived as intrusive in another. Gestures, too, can carry different meanings. A thumbs-up, for instance, is generally positive in many Western cultures, but it’s considered offensive in some parts of the Middle East and Africa. Careful observation and prior research are crucial to avoid such unintentional missteps.
Navigating Communication Barriers
Language differences can present significant challenges when traveling abroad. While learning a few basic phrases in the local language is always appreciated, it’s also important to understand that non-verbal communication plays a vital role. Body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice can often convey more meaning than words. Utilizing translation apps and being patient and understanding when communication is difficult can significantly improve interactions. Carrying a phrasebook or using translation apps can also help bridge the communication gap. Remember that clear and concise communication, even if limited by language, is often more effective than complex sentences.
Appropriate Greetings and Social Interactions
Greetings and social interactions vary significantly across cultures. In many Asian countries, a slight bow is a more appropriate greeting than a handshake. In some Middle Eastern countries, it is customary to greet with a handshake and a kiss on each cheek. In many Latin American countries, a warm embrace and a kiss on the cheek are common greetings between friends and acquaintances. Understanding these nuances ensures that your interactions are both respectful and appropriate. It is always best to observe how locals interact with each other and to follow their lead. For example, in Japan, bowing is a common form of greeting, with the depth of the bow reflecting the level of respect. In contrast, in many Western cultures, a handshake is the standard greeting. Adapting your behavior to the local norms ensures respectful and appropriate interactions.",0.9100342988967896,2745,1.7813690900802612

If you, like many people, are interested in anti-aging treatments to reduce the signs of aging, such as the development of fine lines or wrinkles, we have you covered. In Boca Raton FL, Lifelong Balance takes a holistic approach to aging.
You’ve seen them on television, online, and in magazines: ads for anti-aging creams, lotions, and other products designed to firm skin, reduce wrinkles, and make you look younger.
Anti-aging is the term used to define the process of reversing or slowing down the signs of aging. As we grow older, the regeneration of new cells slows down, leading to wrinkle formation, loss of elasticity and firmness, pigmentation, and sagging skin.
Even though aging is a natural process and there is nothing you can do to stop it, many people are willing to try just about anything to look younger. But what works and what doesn’t? What should you try in your quest to stay looking young for as long as possible?
Anti-aging clinics provide services designed to help you reverse the signs of aging so that you can stay looking younger longer.
Many people want to reverse the signs of aging in their mid-30s or 40s when they notice fine lines and wrinkles around their eyes and mouths.
Wrinkles typically appear on the face, where the skin is thinner, drier, and more fragile than other body areas. As we age, our bodies produce less collagen and elastin, which helps keep skin firm and elastic. Wrinkles become permanent when the skin loses its ability to bounce back into shape. The deeper the wrinkle, the more difficult it is for the skin to bounce back.
Anti-aging clinics combine the best anti-aging treatments with promoting a healthy lifestyle to help you look and feel your best well into your later years. Consulting with a professional team at an anti-aging clinic will help you choose the best treatments for your specific needs.
No two faces are alike. Therefore, each treatment is unique to your needs. The team at Lifelong Balance takes great pride in customizing a treatment plan just for you – whether it be a simple routine or an intensive rejuvenation regimen.

"A few years ago, we met a great guy through our involvement with a music & wine event. He was really interested in Randy’s work and the story behind Lightning Wines. On one particularly fun night out he was also compelled to offer us some help with our little wine brand. At different times throughout the night he talked about connecting us with a friend of his who had been in the wine industry for years, and was specifically involved with Rhone wines. At the end of the night, and the end of every bottle of wine he had on hand, he handed Randy a folded up piece of paper and said, “You really should contact this guy. He could have a big impact on your business.”
We got home that night and Randy unfolded the paper so he could put it on his desk and follow up. This is what he saw:
Andy. No last name. No phone number. No email.
We had a good laugh and pinned it on the fridge.
Over the years, every couple of months, one of us will ask the other if we’ve heard from Andy. No Andy yet.
In November, we poured at the Rhone Rangers tasting in Los Angeles. A gentleman walked up, tried the wines and mentioned that a friend of his told him to seek us out at the tasting. He shook Randy’s hand and introduced himself. Randy looked at him, turned to me and said “Brooke, meet Andy”.

"Understanding Windows trust boundaries is important as a penetration tester as security vulnerabilities are usually found at these boundaries. As an application developer, understanding these boundaries will help you develop more secure applications. I have never found this information consolidated anywhere, hence this blogpost.

This table is generally accurate, there are exceptions to the rule. Some services run under Network Service account, additionally specific applications may lock down their ProgramData folder and allow only High Integrity processes to access. Understanding this makes the hunt for vulnerabilities easier. If you see a process running in High Integrity accessing the ProgramData folder or the HKCU hive, there is an opportunity for vulnerabilities to exist. Likewise, if you can write to certain application's Program Files or subkeys in the HKLM hive as a Medium Integrity user, there is a similar opportunity.
The HKCR hive is a virtual hive that returns values from either HKLM or HKCU depending on the integrity level that the process is running under. This article provides more information. It is important to trace the registry key down to the actual HKLM/HKCU key to determine if there is an opportunity for vulnerabilities to exist.

"In the historic legal case of James Cullen v. Elizabeth Noonan, which unfolded in Dublin in the year 1900, the central conflict revolved around two competing wills attributed to the late Maurice Quaid. This legal battle unfolded as an intense struggle to determine the validity of each will. As the executor of the estate, James Cullen sought to establish a document dated February 2nd, 1897, as the final and legally binding will of Maurice Quaid, a prominent merchant hailing from Usher’s Quay. The defendant in this compelling case was Elizabeth Noonan, who vehemently disputed the 1897 will on several grounds, including alleged want of due execution, claims of undue influence, and contentions that the testator, Maurice Quaid, did not fully comprehend and approve of the will’s contents. Noonan maintained that a previous will should govern the distribution of the estate, a move that intensified the already complex legal proceedings. The ultimate verdict, in this case, would shed light on the intricate familial dynamics and disputes within the Quaid family while providing an exemplar of the intricacies and challenges that can surface in contentious will disputes and probate matters.
At the centre of this legal saga stood Maurice Quaid, the testator whose considerable wealth had been amassed through his successful mercantile endeavours. The total worth of his estate was estimated at a substantial £64,000, a substantial sum in those times, and the distribution of this wealth among his family members was a matter of profound contention. Maurice Quaid was the father of two daughters, Lizzie (who later became the defendant, Elizabeth Noonan) and Bridget, and two sons, George and John. It is important to note that from his first marriage, Quaid had an estranged daughter named Lizzie, who later entered into matrimony with a gentleman named Noonan. This marriage had the unfortunate consequence of straining the relationship between Lizzie and her father, a pivotal factor that would significantly influence the formulation of Maurice Quaid’s various wills.
The legal representatives acting on behalf of James Cullen, the executor appointed by Quaid in his 1897 will, asserted that the document dated February 2nd, 1897, was indeed valid and should be recognized as the final expression of Maurice Quaid’s testamentary intentions. This particular will contain provisions for most of Quaid’s family members, except for Elizabeth Noonan, with whom he had experienced a troubled relationship. Instead of making any provisions for Noonan herself, Quaid designated benefits for her daughter. In contrast, the legal representatives of Elizabeth Noonan claimed that the 1897 will was null and void, advocating for an earlier will as the true reflection of Quaid’s intentions.
A central contention put forth by Noonan’s legal team was that the 1897 will, which notably omitted her from any inheritance, had not been executed in accordance with the legal formalities and was thus not legally binding. They further alleged that Quaid had been unduly influenced in the drafting of this will, insinuating that her own daughter’s husband, James Cullen, had played a pivotal role in orchestrating its contents.
Throughout the course of the trial, various pieces of correspondence exchanged between Maurice Quaid and his family members were presented as crucial evidence. These letters were intended to provide insights into the testator’s state of mind and illuminate the nature of his relationships with his family members. The letters disclosed that while Quaid had a strained relationship with his daughter Elizabeth Noonan, he maintained some level of contact with other family members, including his son-in-law James Cullen.
The legal teams representing both James Cullen and Elizabeth Noonan passionately articulated their arguments and submitted a wealth of evidence to a jury. Both sides endeavoured to demonstrate the validity or invalidity of the 1897 will, giving rise to a legal spectacle that would pose profound questions concerning the proper execution of a will, the spectre of undue influence in testamentary matters, and the rights of family members in the contentious arena of inheritance disputes.
The ultimate outcome of the case hung in the balance, contingent upon the jury’s determination of whether the 1897 will be deemed valid or if an earlier will take precedence. The jury was thus burdened with the responsibility of unravelling the legal intricacies surrounding the execution of a will and probing into the potential presence of undue influence in shaping its contents.
The case of James Cullen v. Elizabeth Noonan stands as a testament to the intricate web of complexities and emotional turmoil that can unfurl in disputes over wills and inheritance. It laid bare the intricate relationships and personal conflicts that simmered within the Quaid family, and in doing so, it serves as a poignant reminder of the utmost importance of ensuring meticulous legal execution and astute estate planning. Such measures are imperative to forestall and mitigate potential conflicts and disputes that can arise when familial bonds are tested in the crucible of probate litigation.
Published in the Belfast News-Letter on Saturday, December 1, 1900, the case of James Cullen v. Elizabeth Noonan serves as a historical marker of an era when legal battles over wills were emblematic of familial discord and societal complexities.

Wrocław UNESCO City of Literature and former WBC, in cooperation with Sharjah UNESCO World Book Capital, starts a fund to help Ukrainian writers, translators and other people of the book. And we invite every literary community to join us in providing support.
It’s been over a month since the Russian army attacked Ukraine and the life of the country’s residents becomes more dramatic every day. Millions have fled in search of safety and shelter, leaving their lives and jobs behind, and many more – stayed to fight, volunteer or take care of their families. Many of them lost any source of income. The situation of writers, illustrators and translators, to a large extent depending on a functioning book market and literary life, is not different. They need financial support to survive these terrible times.
Wrocław Literature House, the operator of Wrocław UNESCO City of Literature, sent out an appeal for help to UNESCO Cities of Literature and World Book Capitals right after the war broke out. The response was immediate and today we are happy to say that thanks to the generous support of Sharjah UNESCO World Book Capital we can establish the Stand with Ukrainian Writers Fund. The aim of the Fund is to provide financial support for writers, translators and other people of the book who remain in Ukraine and who have lost their livelihood. The Fund will finance scholarships and/or copyright purchase. We will also closely cooperate with other Polish institutions and organizations (such as Literary Union Association and Polish Literary Translators Association), as well as Ukrainian UNESCO Cities of Literature and Ukrainian Book Institute, to recognize the needs of Ukrainian writers in the best possible way.

To develop the Fund, we invite first of all international literary communities to support it financially. All the money will be used to directly support authors, illustrators and translators, and – in the future – to finance translation samples of Ukrainian literature into other languages. As the situation develops, some support may be provided also for authors who escape Ukraine. We also ask all partners to actively promote Ukrainian literature among the publishers in your countries.

"It's been a goal of mine to create a Print Your Own Tea Towel Kit. One of my favorite parts about linoleum block printing is how accessible it is: you don't need a lot of big expensive tools, specialized equipment or a large space to get started. I would love to offer a Little Dog Print Shop Tea Towel Kit that contains all the supplies you need as well as a book of step by step instructions for printing a tea towel at home. It seems simple enough, but the task has been more daunting that I initially thought. I thought I would use this blog as a starting point for getting down the step by step instructions that will hopefully one day become part of the kit.
Where better to start than the basics?
Printmaking encompasses a huge variety of skills, techniques, materials tools and artists. You can read an in depth history of printmaking (beginning in China some where around 200BC) here. A paired down version goes like this: Printmaking comes in many forms: from wood carving, to metal engraving, to silk screens, to letterpress to linoleum block prints. It changed the world of art and communication as it became a fast way to reproduce and print multiples. Words and images could be distributed in mass, especially to those who could not afford one of a kind paintings. Today, it is still used as both an important technical and artistic process. It can be as simple as using a potato cut cross wise to print round shapes or as complex as a multilayer/multicolor print that resembles a photograph.

Linoleum Block Print by Me, 2021, Great Blue Heron
My focus has been one color linoleum block prints and will be the kind of printmaking I will focus on for the Print Your Own Tea Towel Kits.
Linoleum block printing is a type of printmaking where you carve into a soft rubber material (linoleum) to create a kind of stamp. It is a great beginner printmaking medium because the soft rubber is easy to manipulate and it is relatively inexpensive.
The important thing to remember when carving a linoleum block print is that you are carving away the white space and what you leave behind will be the colored part of the print. This feels like the opposite of what we are used to. Normally we add lines to a drawing to create a shape. In the case of linoleum block printing, we have to carve around the lines to create the shape.
You can see in this carved block of the great blue heron, I carved away the space around the image (the negative space) and left the lines of the image intact (the positive space).
When I add ink to the block, you can see that the ink is applied to the raised portion of the stamp (the part I did not carve out).
Another important thing to remember about printing with linoleum blocks is that the image will be printed in reverse. This is most important if you are carving letters. You will need to carve out the mirror image of what you want printed. You can see on the tea towel below, the heron is flying to the left, where as in my block above, the heron is flying to the right.
Because I print in one color (often black) I have to rely on shape and textures to create gradient and form. When I design a block I think about which parts will be totally black, which parts will be completely white and which parts will be somewhere in between. For the in between parts, I decide how I want to make that look different. I might use stripes, little tick marks, curves, dots or ""x"" shapes. Look at the different textures and gradients in the bunny and bat print below. Some parts are solid black or white. Some parts have little tick marks spaced far apart and some parts have little tick marks close together. I also use crossing lines, thin lines and thick lines to differentiate different parts of the image. The different textures add interest to the print and they are a unique and signature aspect of printmaking.
Linoleum block prints are very versatile. You can carve simple shapes or more complex shapes filled with texture. You can work large or small. You can do a one color print (above) or a multi-color print (below).
Multiple color images are created by layering several different stamps on top of each other. Each stamp is inked with one color and then each color is printed on top of the previous layer. In the sewing machine print, I carved a block for the black ink, a block for the red ink, and a block for the green ink. Multicolored prints are more complex because you have to make sure the prints align correctly on top of each other and that each color is printed in the correct space.
The great thing about carving linoleum prints is that once the stamp is complete, you can print and reprint as many times as you want. You can print on different surfaces: paper, fabric, cardboard or wood. Each time you print with your block, you may get a slightly different outcome. I love that about linoleum block printing. You really see the handmade process in the final project. In an automated and ever progressing world where most things are created in mass by machines, we could all use a little handmade imperfection every once in a while.

"In recent years, the landscape of sports has witnessed remarkable transformations. While traditional sports like football, basketball, and soccer continue to captivate millions, a new contender has emerged on the scene, quickly capturing the interest and participation of people worldwide. This blog post delves into the fastest growing sport globally, exploring what makes it unique and why it's experiencing such rapid growth.
Understanding the Rise:
One of the most fascinating aspects of this sport's growth is its ability to transcend cultural and geographical boundaries. While many sports find their niche within specific regions, this sport has gained traction across continents, appealing to diverse demographics. But what exactly is this sport?
The sport in question is pickleball. Originally conceived as a backyard game in the mid-1960s, pickleball combines elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong. This hybrid nature is one of its greatest strengths, offering a familiar yet unique experience that attracts players from various sporting backgrounds.
The Allure of Pickleball:
Several factors contribute to pickleball's rapid ascent in popularity. Firstly, the sport is incredibly accessible. With minimal equipment required and the ability to play on various surfaces, pickleball is easy to pick up and enjoy. Its simple rules and smaller court size make it less physically demanding compared to traditional racket sports, opening the door for players of all ages and fitness levels.
Moreover, pickleball fosters a strong sense of community. The sport is inherently social, often played in doubles, which encourages interaction and teamwork. This social aspect has been a significant draw, particularly in a time when people are seeking more community-oriented activities. Pickleball clubs and leagues are sprouting up everywhere, providing a structured yet friendly environment for both competition and camaraderie.
Technological and Media Influence:
Another critical factor in pickleball's growth is its embrace of technology and media. Social media platforms have played a significant role in spreading the word, with influencers and sports enthusiasts sharing their pickleball experiences online. This digital presence has helped demystify the sport, making it more approachable to newcomers.
Additionally, the sport has caught the attention of various media outlets and broadcasters. As pickleball tournaments become more prevalent, they are starting to appear on television and streaming services, further increasing visibility and interest.
Pickleball's meteoric rise as the fastest growing sport can be attributed to its accessibility, social nature, and effective use of media. As it continues to evolve and capture the hearts of players worldwide, pickleball is likely to become a staple in the sporting world. Whether you're a seasoned athlete or a complete novice, now might be the perfect time to pick up a paddle and discover why this sport is taking the world by storm.",0.9548878073692322,567,2.4997141361236572
"For many, summertime means going to the lakeside home and spending blissful days and nights boating, swimming, relaxing and enjoying family and friends. For those lucky people and those that do not have the luxury of a lakeside retreat, here is a sampling of lakeside interiors that will inspire you and perhaps give you a few ideas on how to achieve this relaxed look in your own home, wherever it is.
The view is the reason lakeside homes are so appealing. This is why windows are the prominent element in any lakeside home interior. Unadorned and easily accessible, windows are the focal point. In the modern lakeside home, windows are simple and span the width and height of lakeside rooms. Minimal ornamentation is required, thus not taking away from the view.
Modern lake homes take full advantage of panoramic views and unique architectural design. The use of natural materials enhances the modern lakeside home. The overall design can be minimal to highlight the view and architecture, or the view can be shared with a secondary accent such as a dramatic fireplace. Furnishings can be arranged for equal access to the view and fireplace. Comfortable modular sofas, accent chairs and ottomans can be moved to accommodate the space.
Traditional lake homes are generally designed with rustic appeal in mind or simple, bright spaces with classic furniture and accents. These interiors often have a sense of history, where generations of family have enjoyed summers for decades. These spaces are cozy, warm and welcoming with plenty of windows to take in the views. Often, fireplaces are surrounded by stone and warm wood tones prevail throughout. When painted white, the traditional lakeside home interior is fresh and charming.
Many lakeside homes are built with an open floor plan to accommodate large gatherings of family and friends. This plan is easily enhanced with plenty of comfortable seating and areas where meals can be enjoyed.
A nook for reading and relaxing is often a hidden treasure inside the lake home. This is a place that is cozy and apart from other areas, where guests can linger over a glass of wine or a warm cup of coffee or tea. Late night reading marathons or lazy day slumbers are welcome here as well. Appointed with a comfy sofa or chair, sufficient lighting and decorative items that recall past summers, this room is complete.
Expand the indoors to encompass the outdoor space. Bring the lake indoors with outdoor living areas right off the main interior space. Comfortable seating, a fireplace or fire pit and the view is all that is needed. Add a table for al fresco dining to complete the lake home summer experience.
The lake home is a special summer treat, or can be enjoyed year round. Whether you own a lakefront home or just want the relaxed vibe of one, open up your space and make it comfortable. Create a place where you can relax and enjoy your surroundings. Lakeside or not, you can take full advantage of living like it.",0.9448135495185852,608,1.1882280111312866
"Legalzoom vs. Northwest (2024 Comparison): Who’s The Best?
For more than twenty years, LegalZoom and Northwest Registered Agent have been helping entrepreneurs to form Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) hassle-free. These are both respected companies with countless LLC incorporations under their belts.
However, between these two competitors, which should you choose for your LLC formation? That is why we are here. Let’s take a look at what these two companies provide and how they shape up against each other. That way, you can see which one provides the better overall service. Let’s get started!

Our Comparison Points & Criteria
In order to see which of these companies can provide a better overall experience, we need some criteria to measure them by. Here are the criteria we are going to use to determine which company provides the better service.
Quick LegalZoom & Northwest Comparison
As an entrepreneur, you may be too busy to go through a detailed comparison of these companies. That’s why we prepared this quick comparison so you can check out which of these companies did better.
Price and Features
Northwest offers one LLC formation package for $39 plus state fees. This comes with basic business formation services, registered agent services, and support from their expert Corporate Guides. Overall this is a solid package, but it comes at a premium price.
LegalZoom offers three incorporation packages ranging in cost from $79 to $349. Any of these will offer basic incorporation, and at the highest end, this will provide expedited shipping as well as support from their customer service department. However, none of these packages will offer a registered agent, and at the lower price point, it really does not come with much other than filing your articles of formation with the state.
Overall we are going to call this one a win for Northwest Registered agent because though they do not offer the cheapest price point, it is a far greater value.
Northwest provides some of the best customer support in the industry. With Northwest, you have a guaranteed response time and no automated phone lines. Their representatives are all knowledgeable about the entire formation process. Also, you can choose to work with a specific representative if you had a good experience previously.
LegalZoom has a professional customer service department with extended and weekend hours, so they are available at a convenient time. However, they lack any guaranteed callback time, so it is possible to find yourself frustrated hours down the line.
We are going to have to give this category to Northwest Registered Agent due to both their quality customer service and guaranteed callback time.
Ease of Use
Both LegalZoom and Northwest have a fast and easy checkout process. However, Northwest’s site seems a little out of date and confusing to navigate at times. On the other hand, they do offer a very convenient dashboard to organize all of the paperwork for your LLC.
LegalZoom has an all-around quite clear website, and they make it quite easy to select a package and file for your LLC. Afterward, they provide a functional dashboard for managing your LLC.
This one is a tie because though LegalZoom has a somewhat better website design Northwest Registered Agent provides a superior dashboard for managing your paperwork.
Northwest provides an individual estimate of how long your filing will take based on your state of formation. It will also change if you choose their expedited service in states where it is available.
LegalZoom does things a bit differently and bases their estimates on which package you choose without accounting on the state filing time at all. This often results in their service being better or worse at turnaround time depending on the state. Their estimated times are Economy 30 days, Standard 15 days, and Express Gold 7-10 days.
We are going to have to call this one for Northwest Registered Agent. They provide estimates that are more accurate due to taking into account individual states and providing state expediting service when it is available.
LegalZoom has many more reviews for its services available online. However, they are extremely mixed. Though Northwest has a far more limited base to work from, they are overwhelmingly more positive. We’re going to give this one to Northwest Registered Agent.
Price and Features: LegalZoom vs Northwest
As the thing most budget-strapped entrepreneurs are likely most concerned with, we will cover price and features first. When it comes to LLC formation packages, the price and features they offer vary considerably from company to company. Let’s take a look at these two very distinct companies starting with a quick snapshot comparing these two companies’ basic packages.
LegalZoom | Northwest | |
Time To Process | 30 Business Day | 1-3 Business Days |
Includes Operating Agreement | No: Costs an extra $99 or for expedited processing $199 | Yes |
Includes Registered Agent Service | No: Costs an extra $299 | Yes: The first year is free and then $125 annually |
Includes EIN Filing | No: Costs an extra $60 dollars and has to be purchased alongside an operating agreement for a total of $159 | None |
Annual Compliance Service | No: Costs an extra $55 to $75 | No: Included with purchase of registered agent services |
LegalZoom Pricing Packages
LegalZoom offers three distinct business formation packages tiered by price. These are from cheapest to costliest Economy, Standard, and Express Gold. The more expensive packages offer additional features. However, the primary incentive for these more expensive packages is the quick turnaround time they offer. Let’s take a look at each of these packages.
Northwest Registered Agent Pricing Packages
Northwest Registered Agent offers one package that contains all of the features this company offers. This may not be for everyone looking for a low-priced package without any extra features, but it definitely has an advantage by simplifying the process over shopping between all of the optional extras.
Northwest Registered Agent’s Formation Package: Northwest’s formation package costs $39 plus state filing fees. This comes with a speedy filing and an estimated turnaround time based on your state of formation. In states where it is available, you can opt for expedited processing, in which case you will receive an estimated time based on this option.
Northwest will perform a name availability search against the official business name database of your state of formation to ensure the name you have chosen isn’t already claimed by another business entity.
They will also prepare and file your Articles of Organization with your state of formation. These are the documents that contain the basic information of the company you are attempting to file. These will be filed with the state to officially form your LLC.
This service will also come with an operating agreement. Though this document is typically not required by the state, it can be extremely useful and help you to acquire bank accounts and settle disputes between members. An operating agreement will describe the ownership structure of your company and how it will be operated.
Finally, Northwest will provide one year free of their registered agent services. This is important because every LLC must have a registered agent to receive legal communications on behalf of the company. Though this can be a member of the LLC, most business owners choose to designate a service to act on their behalf for many reasons, so it is likely you would choose to nominate one anyway. After one year is up, the service costs $125 annually.
Northwest wins this one because though they cost more than LegalZoom’s lowest-priced package, it provides much more value than its competitor. Northwest’s service comes with an operating agreement and a year of registered agent services the latter of which is a considerable expense to purchase separately. This makes Northwest a very good deal and wins them this category.
Customer Support: LegalZoom vs. Northwest
Even the best product will often turn out worthless if something goes wrong and there is no one there to help. When things go wrong, it’s important that these companies are there to help. So, let’s see how they do.
LegalZoom Customer Support
LegalZoom provides phone, email, and live chat support with hours from 5 am to 7 pm PT Weekday and from 7 am to 4 pm PT weekends. These are longer hours than many of their competitors, and they maintain a large customer service department that will generally get back to you in a reasonable amount of time. However, there are many customer complaints that claim they took days to get back in touch.
Northwest Customer Support
Northwest provides support by phone and email. They guarantee a response by email within a day, and if you do not get in touch directly by phone, they guarantee a call back within two hours. This is very impressive by itself and all of their customer support agents or as they call them corporate guides are based in the US and trained in every part of the LLC formation process.
Generally, LegalZoom offers good customer support; however, Northwest excels at it. Their corporate guides are knowledgeable and skilled at providing top-notch service. Plus, the guaranteed response time is truly impressive and a service most of their competitors could learn something from.
Ease of Use: LegalZoom vs Northwest
Figuring out how to form an LLC for your business can be challenging, and that’s just what you’re paying these services to do for you. So, how easy they make their service to use is important. Let’s see how well they do.
LegalZoom has a different process than many other LLC formation services. You need to give them some personal information and choose whether or not to purchase some add-ons. Then, you choose your formation package and finish the process. Having the upsells before picking a formation package can be inconvenient if you’re not already sure what package you want.
Northwest’s ordering process is very easy but their website is a little old fashioned and difficult to navigate. They have only one package, so there are not a lot of choices to make. Also, to place your order, you just give a few details about yourself and your business. Then, you pay, and you’re done.
Northwest and LegalZoom tie this category. They both make their ordering process easy. Northwest doesn’t have a lot of upsells like their competitor. Unlike Northwest Registered Agent, LegalZoom has upsells, but their website is easier to navigate. Overall, neither is perfect, but they get the job done pretty well.
Turnaround Time: LegalZoom vs. Northwest
Nobody likes being made to wait, particularly when it comes to starting their business. This can cost time but also a considerable amount of money. A fast turnaround time can be a make or break for many small business owners. Let’s see how fast these companies work.
The turnaround times for LegalZoom depend on the package you purchase instead of which state you have chosen to form your LLC in. People who purchase more expensive packages have their orders prioritized over the orders from less expensive packages. With the Express Gold Package, the turnaround time is 7-10 business days. Whereas, the turnaround time for the Standard Package is 15 business days. The Economy Package has the slowest turnaround time at 30 business days.
The turnaround time for your LLC formation with Northwest depends on the state’s processing time. Northwest will show you an estimated processing time. For most states, they will show two estimated processing times since most states offer expedited service.
Northwest wins this category. LegalZoom’s turnaround times are pretty long if you don’t purchase one of their more expensive packages. In comparison, Northwest’s turnaround times depend on the processing time of your state of formation. This can be long as well at times. But, at least you don’t need to pay more to get a better turnaround time.
Customer Reviews: LegalZoom vs Northwest
Whether or not they look good on paper, a former customer’s experience can say a lot about a company. Let’s take a look at what these companies former customers have to say about them
LegalZoom gets mixed customer reviews. On Trustpilot, they get 4.1 out of 5 stars, and most of the people reviewing the service seemed happy with the service. However, 26% did rate LegalZoom as bad. Many of the complaints were about turnaround times.
The Better Business Bureau gives LegalZoom an A rating, and it gets 4.23 out of 5 stars from its customer reviews. Here are two examples of these reviews below.

Northwest Registered Agent does not have enough reviews on Trustpilot to get a rating. However, the reviews they received are good. Northwest gets 4.28 out of 5 stars from customers on the Better Business Bureau website and an A rating. Here are two of the reviews they received.
Northwest does not have the same considerable number of reviews that LegalZoom has received, but the ones they have certainly say a lot. Customers seem to be overwhelmingly happy with Northwest.
LegalZoom and Northwest Registered Agent have both been in the business of forming LLCs for a long time, and either one will certainly get the job done well. But we set out to determine who would get it done better, and we have definitely found our victor.
We have seen what these two companies have to offer their customers and how they measure up. Northwest has won in four out of five of our criteria and tied in another. Using this as our point to measure, it is pretty clear that Northwest has more to offer customers in need of LLC Formation services.

FAQs About Northwest & LegalZoom
Will these companies help me stay in compliance with state requirements?
Northwest Registered Agent and LegalZoom both have services that will help your LLC stay in compliance with your state. However, they have different packages and prices.
LegalZoom will provide your LLC with registered agent service, but they do not include this service in their packages. They charge $299 per year for their registered agent service. LegalZoom will also file your annual report for $55.
Northwest Registered Agent includes a year of free registered agent service with all of their packages and charges $125 per year after the first year.
Is publication service offered by both companies?
In some states, LLCs and corporations are required to publish notification of their formation in a newspaper in the region. New York, Arizona, and Nebraska all require publication for LLCs. Whereas Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, and Nebraska require publication for corporations.
Unfortunately, neither LegalZoom nor Northwest provides publication service. Although, Northwest does provide a detailed list of instructions on how to fulfill the publication requirement yourself. If your state does require publication, it is important to find out the deadline for completing the requirement and make sure you fulfill the requirement within the allowed time to avoid any potential penalties.
Do both of these companies offer refunds?
Both LegalZoom and Northwest offer refunds for up to 60 days after purchase to allow you to decide if you are happy with their service. If for any reason, you are unhappy with the service within this period, you can request a refund.

"In the realm of finance and accounting, the meticulous preparation of loan accounting reports holds significant importance. These reports not only provide a snapshot of a company’s financial health but also play a crucial role in decision-making processes, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder confidence. As the landscape of financial reporting evolves alongside advancements in technology and changes in regulatory requirements, the trends in loan accounting reports preparation are also evolving. This article delves into some of the key trends shaping this crucial aspect of financial management.
- Automation and AI Integration
One of the most notable trends in loan accounting reports preparation is the increasing reliance on automation and artificial intelligence (AI). Financial institutions and companies are leveraging AI to streamline the process of data collection, validation, and analysis. Machine learning algorithms are being used to identify patterns in data, detect anomalies, and even predict potential risks.
Automation not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of loan accounting but also reduces the reliance on manual processes prone to errors. Tasks such as data entry, reconciliation, and compliance checks can now be performed more swiftly and reliably through AI-powered systems. This trend is not just about reducing costs but also about enhancing the overall quality and timeliness of financial reporting.
- Enhanced Data Analytics
In tandem with automation, there is a growing emphasis on enhanced data analytics capabilities in loan accounting reports preparation. Modern accounting software and tools allow finance professionals to delve deeper into the data, generating insights that were previously inaccessible.
Through data analytics, organizations can better understand trends in loan performance, assess credit risks more accurately, and optimize loan portfolios. Advanced analytics techniques, including predictive modeling and scenario analysis, enable financial institutions to make informed decisions and adapt swiftly to changing market conditions.
- Integration of Regulatory Changes
The regulatory landscape governing financial reporting, including loan accounting, is constantly evolving. Financial institutions must stay abreast of these changes to ensure compliance and mitigate regulatory risks. Consequently, there is a trend towards integrating regulatory updates directly into accounting systems.
Modern accounting software often includes features that automatically update calculations and disclosures based on the latest regulatory requirements. This integration not only reduces the risk of non-compliance but also enhances the efficiency of preparing regulatory reports.
- Focus on Transparency and Disclosure
Transparency and disclosure are becoming increasingly important in loan accounting reports. Stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and even customers, expect clear and comprehensive information about a company’s loan portfolio and related risks.
Financial reporting standards, such as those set by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), emphasize the importance of transparent and informative disclosures. Companies are encouraged to provide detailed explanations of their accounting policies, assumptions, and risk assessments related to loans.
- Embrace of Cloud-Based Solutions
Cloud computing has revolutionized the way organizations store, process, and analyze data, and loan accounting is no exception. Many companies are migrating their accounting systems to cloud-based platforms for greater flexibility, scalability, and security.
Cloud-based solutions enable real-time collaboration among geographically dispersed teams, which is particularly beneficial for multinational corporations and financial institutions with global operations. These platforms also offer robust data backup and recovery mechanisms, ensuring the integrity and availability of financial data.
- Enhanced Security Measures
With the increasing digitization of financial processes, cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern in loan accounting reports preparation. Financial institutions are implementing enhanced security measures to protect sensitive financial data from cyber threats and unauthorized access.
Encryption technologies, multi-factor authentication, and regular security audits are becoming standard practices in safeguarding financial information. Compliance with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, further underscores the importance of robust security protocols.
- Adoption of Blockchain Technology
Blockchain technology, renowned for its decentralized and immutable ledger system, is gradually making inroads into loan accounting. By leveraging blockchain, financial institutions can enhance the transparency, security, and efficiency of loan transactions and reporting.
Smart contracts on blockchain platforms can automate loan agreements and facilitate real-time updates to loan accounting records. The decentralized nature of blockchain reduces the risk of fraud and ensures the integrity of financial data across all stakeholders involved in loan transactions.
- Increased Focus on Sustainability Reporting
In recent years, there has been a heightened focus on sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in corporate reporting. This trend is extending to loan accounting reports, with stakeholders increasingly interested in understanding how loans contribute to or align with sustainability goals.
Companies are integrating ESG criteria into their loan portfolios and disclosing information on how environmental and social factors are considered in lending decisions. This transparency not only enhances corporate reputation but also meets the growing demand for sustainable finance options.
- Training and Skill Development
As technology continues to reshape the landscape of loan accounting, there is a growing demand for finance professionals with expertise in data analytics, AI, and regulatory compliance. Companies are investing in training programs to upskill their teams and ensure they are equipped to leverage the latest technologies effectively.
Training initiatives encompass not only technical skills but also ethical considerations in AI and data usage, as well as understanding the evolving regulatory environment. Continuous learning and professional development are essential for finance professionals to stay ahead in the dynamic field of loan accounting.
- Collaboration with External Auditors
Finally, collaboration between financial institutions and external auditors is crucial in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of loan accounting reports. Auditors provide independent verification of financial statements and compliance with regulatory requirements, offering valuable insights and recommendations for improvement.
Increasingly, auditors are leveraging data analytics and AI tools themselves to enhance the audit process and provide more thorough and insightful audits. This collaboration fosters trust and confidence among stakeholders in the integrity of loan accounting practices.
In conclusion, the preparation of loan accounting reports is undergoing significant transformation driven by technological advancements, regulatory changes, and evolving stakeholder expectations. Automation, enhanced data analytics, and the integration of regulatory updates are among the key trends shaping this field. As financial institutions and companies adapt to these trends, they are not only improving the efficiency and accuracy of their loan accounting processes but also enhancing transparency, compliance, and decision-making capabilities. Looking ahead, the continued evolution of technology and regulatory frameworks will likely further influence how loan accounting reports are prepared and utilized in the financial landscape.",0.9415467381477356,1285,1.606911540031433

"Krishna consciousness is meant to spread all over the planet.
24th April 2016
hare krsna hare krsna, krsna krsna hare hare
hare rama hare rama, rama rama hare hare.
In the country of a population of only three million people in this country, there are so many devotees here in a country of not many people.
manushyanam sahasreshu kashchid yatati siddhaye (BG 7.3)
Amongst thousands of persons, hardly one strives for perfection
Krishna says in the Bhagavad gita that one out of a thousand would be interested in Him. They will endeavor for some spiritual perfection. So you are those rare, one out of a thousand thousands who are present here. So that Krishna conscious time has come for you or in your place. I was just thinking that fifty years ago it was just the one Srila Prabhupada in New York.
During kirtan there was no big hall like this with hundreds in the audience and the microphone system and the guitar also and the deities. None of this was there and it started with one person on the footpath. You understand footpath? I mean I am sitting on a big cushion here and there was someone to invite me and offering me a seat but in New York no-one was offering Prabhupada. And with one pair of kartals he would do kirtan.
hare krsna hare krsna,
krsna krsna hare hare
hare rama hare rama
rama rama hare hare
So that was fifty years ago and there was but one person, the founder acarya of the international society of Krishna consciousness. There was but just one temple in New York where Prabhupada gave the name ‘International society’ to this society. This is a local society in one of the states, New York which is one state in America.
So he was thinking that in the future this society is going to be international society for Krishna consciousness. Even one day in Lithuania, Krishna’s name will be chanted. Srila Prabhupada had that confidence; he had full faith in the prediction of Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu who predicted
prthivite ache yata nagaradi grama
sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama
“In every town and village, the chanting of My name will be heard.” (Caitanya-bhagavata, Antya 4.126)
‘My name will be chanted in every town and every village of this planet.’ So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu appeared and then He disappeared after the forty eight years that He was on this planet. God was on this planet, Haribol! God is not some light or some concept but he is a personality, solid, spiritual, eternal.
He had a name, and you could put the name and the face together and that is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. And His activities and His associates and His abode and we all, His parts and parcels. It doesn’t matter where you are from or where I am from, it doesn’t really matter. So the Lord said
mamaivamso jiva loke
jiva bhutah sanatanah (B G 15.7)
The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.
‘All the living entities are my parts and parcels.’ Okay fine you are born in Lithuania now, but fifty years ago you were not Lithuanians and in the next life what would be your nationality? This keeps changing all the time. There is not much dust here but it’s like dust particles which keep floating, coming in and going out.
Sometimes the window is open and you see some dust particles just moving around and going in and coming out. Like that all of us living entities are moving round and round and down. Two thousand years ago Christianity existed since two, three thousand years only. But what about before that?
It was Vedic culture, Krishna consciousness that pervaded the planet. Christianity is two, three’s thousand years and Islam is fourteen hundred years, Sikhism is five hundred years and like that. Before that there was just one family all over the planet, Bharat Varsha. And that’s why there is a concept, a thought in Vedic literature that says
ayam nijah paroveti ganana laghu chetasam
udaracharita vasudhaiva vutumbakam
Those who think ‘oh, these people are my people but these are some outsiders, some others’ those who think like this are counted as laghu chetasam.
Their chetana, their thoughts are narrow. Small minded think like this. Narrow minded people think in terms of ‘ours and theirs and my country and their country. Those who are kind hearted think in terms of the whole world being one family
Those who are udaracharita, who have chetana or broad minded consciousness, they are big hearted. So if the Lord is in the heart then the heart becomes big hearted. They think that everybody on this planet is part of my family. So these are all man-made countries and also they divide. This country, that country and this religion, that religion, but the soul is transcendental to all these designations and boundaries and divisions and fragmentations.
So, Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu ki jai!
He is the Lord, He is the Lord. Jesus is the son of the Lord and a good son of the Lord. A good son, a very good son but how could god have only one son and how could we limit god? How many sons do you have, you sir?
One, two? Okay. So this gentleman could have two children, is there someone with three or four children here? Yes so here we are, here they go, so many of them. Someone has half a dozen? So human beings have two, three or four. In India to have or in Mauritius to have one dozen children is not a big thing (laughter).
We know even Bhakti Vinod Thakur had a close to a dozen children. So how could god have just one son? God must have unlimited sons and we can see that we are all sons and daughters of the Lord. Maybe we were all bad sons but now it is the time to become good sons and good daughters of the Lord.
And the Lord is Lord, He is everybody’s Lord like the sun is everybody’s sun, it’s the same sun in the sky. It doesn’t become Lithuanian sun and ‘oh no it’s the Japanese sun and oh no now it’s the Russian sun or now it is the American sun.’ The sun is sun of all of us and this is a common thing that everyone understands that the Lord is but one for all of us, one god.
One only difference is that the Vedic literature or Krishna consciousness or sanatan dharma or Bhagavad dharma has so much detailed information about god. Srila Prabhupada used to say that we even know the phone number of god. What is that number, he would say
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare

So if you are in difficulty don’t call the police but call out for mercy and chant the holy names of the Lord and He will respond. So Krishna consciousness is something that’s meant to spread and spread till it reaches every town and every village of this planet. How will this happen?
Some impossible thoughts like that may come, but if this much could happen, if someone was told in India or even here in your country say even fifty years ago, that in 2016 in the month of April on the 24th in this hall there is going to be a house full and all of them would be waiting to have the holy name, who could have believed this fifty years ago? Who could even have believed that?
What is this Hare Krishna? Fifty years ago nobody would have believed such a thing, this is impossible. So if this much is possible then the rest of whatever is also possible. So many in the last fifty years- this is the fiftieth year of the ISKCON golden jubilee celebration of Iskcon which is at the moment celebrating just like a victory celebration.
Param vijayate sri Krishna sankirtan, this is the victory. In ’66 we had one temple and now in 2016 we have seven hundred temples (shouts of Haribol)! There are now a countless number of followers, chanters of the holy name. Many now study the Bhagavad Gita and millions of copies of Bhagavad Gita have been distributed in the last fifty years.
I was in Czech Republic where the population is ten million but you would be amazed to hear that the devotees there have distributed two million copies of Srila Prabhupada’s books. In a population of ten million, two million books have been distributed in just the last twenty years or so. So in another twenty years or in another fifty years or in another hundred years you can imagine how it is going to spread.
There was also a report in a magazine called news week, the cover story that said ‘the fastest growing religion in the former Soviet Union is the Hare Krishna religion.’ Haribol! They also said, I don’t know where they got that number from but they said that there were seven hundred thousand followers of Hare Krishna in the former Soviet Union.
So spreading of Krishna consciousness and spreading of the holy name all over the world is just a vision of the Lord, a plan of the Lord and a prediction of the Lord. There is no power on the earth that can stop this from happening and it doesn’t matter how super that power may be. Super duper, they say ‘super duper’ power and so it doesn’t matter how much it is.
If the Lord wants this to happen then this must happen and we are seeing it happen. There are so many good results and the Hare Krishna’s are good people, good human beings. They are well behaved and very pious and they love their neighbours. Just like the bible says ‘love thy neighbour as thy self and thou shall not kill’ the bible says.
We are the ones following that and so our devotee, he was asked that question in India ‘why did you give up your religion? You were Christian and now you have become a Hare Krishna, Hindu.’ He said ‘no no no I have not become a Hindu! I have become a better Christian. Before this I had heard that thou shall not kill but I was killing or someone else was killing for me.
Turkey on thanks giving, but I don’t do that anymore. Our bible says ‘love thy Lord with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy strength. And now I know the Lord and I am loving the Lord and serving the Lord with all my heart and all my strength. So I was Christian in name only but now I have become a better Christian.’
In the Quran you will find ninety nine names of god, Allah. So their rosary, so their japa beads has ninety nine beads to chant the names of Allah. Hallelujah, no? So this Hallelujah has made their name be hallowed or glorified, so like that. So all religions talk of chanting the holy names of the Lord. Allah Akbar, you have heard this?
In the mosque they pray five times a day and they say ‘Allah Akbar, god is great.’ Allah means god who is great. So that is fine that the Lord is great. Prabhupada said that ‘yes they say that god is great but how is he great? What makes him great? They cannot say so much.’ A Muslim also means one who is surrendered unto god and if that is the understanding then we are Muslims also as we are surrendered unto God.

"Five women charged with stealing more than $100,000 of merchandise from retail stores
Five women were charged with stealing more than $100,000 of clothing and other merchandise from retail stores in an alleged organized theft ring operating in Baltimore, Harford, Anne Arundel, Charles and Montgomery counties, the state Attorney General’s office announced Wednesday. Tyrayah Shonita Graham, 23; Donna Leurine Moye, 39; Lisa Marie Williams, 54; Lyric Taj McLaughlin, 21; and Tiara Kianna Baker, 19, were charged with conspiracy to commit a theft scheme with a value of $100,000 or more, according to Attorney General Brian Frosh’s office. Moye and Williams are also charged with possessing and selling counterfeit goods. None of the suspects had attorneys listed in online state court records.
The women allegedly targeted retail stores such as Dick’s Sporting Goods, Victoria’s Secret and Pink, prosecutors said. They would enter a store together, put large amounts of merchandise from store displays into large bags they brought with them, then leave without paying, prosecutors said. “Images of the stolen goods were then posted on Instagram to advertise the items,” prosecutors said. Prosecutors did not say specifically how much was stolen, or from where. “These individuals stole thousands of dollars’ worth of merchandise through an organized operation and then advertised for sale the stolen goods on the Internet,” Frosh said in a statement. “Working with our partners, we were able to shut down this ring and put the thieves behind bars.” [Source: The Baltimore Sun]
Teen accused of armed robbery, shoplifting
An Anderson County, South Carolina, teen has been arrested on multiple charges related to several business robberies. According to a Anderson County Sheriff’s Office news release, Marcus Demarius Smith, 19, was arrested and charge with armed robbery, robbery, possession of a weapon during a violent crime and shoplifting. The sheriff’s office said on Dec. 11, 2017, deputies responded to Taco Bell, located at 2629 S. Main St. around 6 p.m., in reference to an armed robbery. Employees at the restaurant said the suspect went in the business with a gun and took the cash register from the building. On Jan. 28, deputies were called to Dollar General, 2835 S. Main St. in reference to a shoplifting around 6:50 p.m. The manager of the store told deputies that the suspect entered the store and left without paying for his items when his card was declined. Around 8 p.m. on that same day, deputies responded to the same Dollar General, for another shoplifting complaint. The clerk at the store told deputies that she was outside collecting shopping carts and when she went back inside, a man was behind the counter grabbing items and putting them in a bag. She said when she tried to call police, the man knocked her aside and ran from the store. Smith was taken to the Anderson County Detention Center. [Source: WSPA7 News]
Woman gets more prison time for repeat shoplifting
Jessica Allison, 37, of York, Nebraska, has been given more prison time after repeatedly being caught shoplifting. York County District Judge James Stecker sentenced her to an additional year in prison, to be served consecutively with the sentence she is already serving at the Nebraska Center for Women. In March of 2015, in York County, Allison was sent to prison for 1-2 years after a series of crimes, including shoplifting and tampering with evidence. Just prior to that conviction, she was sentenced for shoplifting in Lancaster County. At that particular time, other shoplifting cases and a charge of flight to avoid arrest were pending and she was sentenced for another separate conviction in Seward County.
This most recent case took place in mid-May, 2017, according to the factual basis proceedings earlier provided by York County Attorney Christopher Johnson. He said that York police officers were called to a local business where workers believed Allison had stolen approximately $170 worth of merchandise. Johnson said police reviewed surveillance video which showed her using a knife to remove security mechanisms, hiding the items in a bag and covering the bag with her jacket. Workers asked her as she left the store if she had found everything she was looking for and she told them they didn’t carry what she wanted. Suspecting illegal activity was taking place, which was also due to prior contacts they had had with Allison, the workers wrote down the license plate number on the vehicle in which she left. She was later arrested and charged. “She is currently serving a prison sentence so she is not a good candidate for probation,” Johnson said this week during court proceedings. “The pre-sentence investigation also highlights other concerns, such as her continued criminal activities and continued warrants.” “She has been unable to make restitution as she has been in prison,” York County Public Defender Nancy Waldron told the court, asking that if a prison sentence was to be pronounced that it be concurrent with the sentence she is now serving.

Man jailed on 35 counts of credit card fraud
According to Houston Co. Sheriff’s Office, Brandon Kemp of Perry, Georgia, is charged with 35 counts of financial transaction card fraud, one count of identity theft and one count of theft by receiving stolen property. Deputies say they received information from the victim on Jan. 4 that he had extensive unauthorized charges on his Miami-Dade Credit Union account. An investigation led deputies to find Kemp obtained the debit card from the victim in December. Kemp is being held at the Houston County Detention Center on $15,780 bond. [Source: WGXA News]
NFL warns fans to be wary of counterfeit merchandise and tickets
Sure, that Eagles T-shirt looks good on you, but are you sure it’s not counterfeit? Fake Super Bowl merchandise is flooding into the Twin Cities this week, and federal agents who usually fight terrorists are stalking our skyways and scrutinizing shopping tags to figure out if they can seize racks full of suspect sweatshirts and sham hats. It’s a big problem, according to the National Football League. Before last year’s Super Bowl in Houston, agents with the Department of Homeland Security — working with local law enforcement — confiscated more than 260,000 counterfeit items worth more than $20 million, court records show. A total of 56 people were arrested for selling illegal merchandise, including fake tickets to the big game. And that wasn’t the biggest haul. That happened in 2016, when 450,000 illegal items worth $39 million were seized. On Monday, a Hennepin County judge granted the league and its agents permission to seize all suspected contraband without the notices typically required in court. The order came in response to an emergency lawsuit the league filed against 100 unspecified counterfeiters on Jan. 24.
In its lawsuit, the NFL described “large networks of itinerant resellers looking to maximize their profits as quickly as possible before leaving town without a trace.” The NFL said in the suit that fans suffer because many of the counterfeit items are of substandard quality, with clothing tearing, shrinking and fading prematurely. They said fans can often spot the difference between fake and legitimate clothing by checking for low quality fabric, loose stitching and off-center logos. “Only companies that meet high standards of quality, performance and reliability receive a license to use or sell products bearing the NFL trademarks,” the league said in its suit. Tickets are another hot item for counterfeiters, and the stakes are even higher for those who get suckered. Every year, according to league officials, fans are turned away at the stadium because they bought a counterfeit ticket, or came with a ticket that had been stolen and resold. To avoid being victimized, the NFL urges fans to avoid buying tickets from someone on the street, and to pay for all transactions with a credit card. League officials also note that counterfeit tickets can be quite sophisticated. To deter fraud, the NFL insists on paper tickets using logos with heat sensitive ink. The hologram logo disappears when rubbed and returns when the ink cools. Other images can only be seen under black light. [Source: StarTribune]
Employee arrested for stealing oxycodone
A manager at Walgreens, 9449 S. Howell Ave., called police Jan. 23 about an employee who had been stealing narcotics. The employee, a pharmacy technician at the store, admitted to police she had been stealing oxycodone pills from February 2017 to January 2018. She said she did not have an exact number of pills or dollar amount, but that it was less than 100 pills. She was arrested on charges of theft and possession of Schedule II drugs.

"When I was 6 year old I wanted to be a florist, I was annoyed because my mum had called me Anna Lucia and not Cristina, and I had founded the Pink Panther club with Sara.
When I was 8 I thought that, as a grown-up, I would become a hairdresser, I cried because they forced me to study guitar and with my pocket money I bought my first pair of glittery pink pumps.
At the age of 10 I was sure that at 20 I would be a fashion designer, I spent afternoons filling the pages of my diary listening to Toto Cutugno and stamping my feet because I wanted a mountain bike.
At 13 came the certainty that I would become a famous actress; I used to go to theatre matinees with Elena, I wrote secret letters to Tom Cruise, I listened to Bryan Adams 24/7 and in my spare time I would cry on the notes of Everything I do, I do it for you.
When I was 16, nothing would keep me from the successful path that glimpsed in the field of volleyball … however I also had a Plan B: run away with the ski instructor, who seemed more interested in me than Tom Cruise was.
At 20, I had run out of options about my future, I was studying in the cold city of Feltre to get top marks and I was betting the last coins of the day at Squatters with Lin & El.
16 more years have passed since, and the passion for baking is the only thing that has remained constant over time, accompanying me in the joys and in the sorrows.
I didn’t become a hairdresser, a florist or a famous actress. I do a job that I never imagined, I like to spend the little free time I have between books on baking, flowers and preparing with Gabriele lavish dinners for our friends.

"TODAY, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT CREATING WHITESPACE AS A FAMILY. You’ve heard me talk about creating whitespace in your business and I’ve walked you through my week to week strategies to have more whitespace so that you can show up consistently. I’ve also shared a little behind the scenes of my quarterly whitespace retreat where I go into visionary mode. Now it’s time to make sure you have that same intentionality with your family.
It is so easy to pack our schedules as people with businesses and kids. Between work stuff, and the kids’ school and extracurricular stuff, house that needs tending to, friends to see, and family to take care of, you may feel like you don’t have an ounce more to give. Trust me, I get it!
But the same way you might feel at max capacity in your business and the thought of creating some whitespace makes you uncomfortable (because you feel like you are not being productive yet you know it is literally the difference maker in the success that you’re seeking) the same reigns true for your family.
This is not just a season, this is now a habit. This hustle, this hurry is a habit and the only way to have that connection, contentment, vision and thriving that you crave as a family is through the creation of more margin. So today, we’re talking about what that looks like, how to undo what might be a little bit broken at this point in terms of habits, and how to bring your family along with you.
Let’s raise them up right!
IN THIS EPISODE, WE COVER:
[2:35] It’s Not Just a Phase, It’s the Choices You’re Making
Growing up in the Christian church, there is the idea of taking a full day of rest and having a full day dedicated to prayer, family, connection and tradition, with no work, no distraction.
When I started to get a little bit older and my sports would show up on the weekends, my mom despised when we’d have games on Sunday because that was our day to go to church and to be prayerful and to be together as a family. We would eat a long drawn out meal that went into the evening with all of my grandparents and aunts and uncles and cousins and everybody together in the family. That was our margin.
And now in retrospect, I completely get it. It’s so important to have that space to connect and grow. And I think the struggle I have is that I don’t feel like something is valuable unless it’s productive. When I first started implementing whitespace or margin into my business, it made me very uncomfortable because at that point I was maxed out on time. I was taking client after client and the idea of taking time away from clients meant less money in the business. But what I didn’t realize was to make the leap into my next level of success, I had to build that margin in. So, although it was very much outside of my comfort zone, I knew it was what had to happen because I was studying the leaders that I admired and that was the separator. That was what they had that I didn’t. They had space to think, create, rest, connect and pray and just evolve. It was serving such a deep purpose that I couldn’t see at the time.
So, when you think about your family, how is it any different? When we pack our weeks, that’s a problem, and it’s not just a phase. It’s the choices you’re making. It doesn’t have to be this way. It’s how society says it’s done but it doesn’t have to happen like this.
[6:07] Prioritizing What Really Matters
Recently, I met an amazing homeschooling mom who has seven kids. And my first thought was: “Why are you so put together and why are your kids so well behaved?” I have three kids and only one of them is really in activities and I feel like I can’t keep up. She explained that her kids are only allowed to play one sport per year which they get to pick themselves.
I resisted this idea, I felt my body tense up when she said it, but then I sat with it for a day and I talked with Michael about it the next day and then we started talking about it in regards to our own family. We talked about it the next time we saw her and the reason she does it is so that they have enough margin to prioritize what really matters – family, faith, falling in love with learning and discovering what they’re really called to. Half the time the sports I played growing up I played because my friends were doing it. I didn’t even like it. The sports I actually loved were few and far between, but I was spread across a lot of different things and I wasn’t taking the time to really engage and think about what was speaking to me and what I wanted to do because I was so busy jumping from one thing to the next.
[8:54] Be Unconventional and Intentional
This is society’s model, and we have fallen into it. We don’t have that intentional time that we’re creating on purpose with our families.
What’s the cost if we don’t do this?
I’m challenging you to look at your life as it is and think about how you want it to look. You don’t have to follow the trends, you can choose a different path. You’ve chosen entrepreneurship, so that already puts you in an unconventional boat. Why not follow that in how you raise your babies, why not look for the ways that work for you to cultivate the values and the life and the lifestyle and the possibility and the connection that you really want?
Is this “”phase” that you’re accepting into your life today, facilitating and getting you closer to the way you want to be living or is it robbing you of the possibility of it?
Sometimes you have to sit down and shake yourself from it and disrupt and change the way you operate. Find what works for you, what works for your family and what does your family actually want? Find out how you can create and honor margin.
[11:28] Don’t Let Your Superpowers Become Your Limitations
Do you even have space in your lives to play, create, talk, rest? We’ve opened the doors to our Raising Luminaries Co(op) and it’s been amazing to see the conversations in there from the families of what is shifting in their world and the wake up calls they’ve had.
You want to raise leaders, you want your kids to be intentional and innovative and free spirited and critical thinking. You need to start creating that space and to honor it and to protect it because that’s the key.
The first step is picking your margin rhythm. Is it each day? Is there an hour a day that you honor together as a family? Or is it something like a day a week? This depends on your family and how you guys work best. We do a little bit of both. We have periods of time during the day that are our margin and then we also have it once a week on Sundays, and we really live by it.
The second thing that can really help with this is talking as a family about why there’s value here. What’s getting lost in not honoring this and not doing this? What’s possible if you do honor this and do this? And then decide as a family what that time will look like. Also, remember that you’re the boss. There’s a problem if you’re an adult parent and your seven-year-old is dictating how they’re being raised. Because last time I checked, I’ve never met a seven-year-old who successfully raised a successful adult because they haven’t lived it. I like the idea of keeping it fluid and having conversations with the family and bringing them in and not being a dictator, but at the same rate, I’m leading this train and they have to put some trust in me.
Finally, honor it and live by it. Model margin in your businesses and in your life. Teach your kids the power of margin: more creativity, more recovery, connection, prayer, fulfillment, peace. This might have to come from the top down. Mom and dad might have to learn how to work within these new parameters. Remember that your superpowers can also become your limitations if they take over that power from you. Without margin and the ability to have margin and the fear of margin, those superpowers are taken over and it’s time to take back that control.
I hope today’s episode helps you to breathe life into your family again, to breathe peace into your world again, and give your kids an opportunity that the rest of the world is not giving their kids because they’re not aware of the dangers of just going constantly, without any space.

"Whether you are a lifelong Nevada resident or just moved to the area with your canine companion, you need to learn how to keep your dog cool during the scorching-hot Nevada summers. The average high temperature in the state in July is 104 degrees Fahrenheit, although it is not unusual for temperatures to reach into the high 90s and low 100s all summer long. You must keep the temperature in mind any time you take your dog outdoors, whether you plan to take them for a long walk or just a quick romp in the back yard.
Read on to learn how to keep your dog healthy and happy when you live in a state prone to super-high summer temperatures, and to recognize the signs of heatstroke that signal that your dog needs immediate medical treatment.
Some Dogs Are More Prone to Heatstroke
Before you learn about how to prevent canine heatstroke, it is important to recognize that some dogs are more prone to heatstroke than others are. If you just moved to Nevada and are still getting acclimated to the summer heat, realize that your dog is, too – dogs that are not used to high temperatures are more likely to overheat more quickly than those that are used to the heat. Dogs that primarily stay indoors where it is cool also need time to acclimate to outdoor heat.
Dogs who are overweight, elderly, and/or have pre-existing health conditions can overheat more quickly, as can breeds with thick coats. Some dog breeds are also especially susceptible to heatstroke due to their unique airways, coat types, and general breed health concerns. Breeds more prone to heatstroke include:
- Cavalier King Charles spaniel
Canine Heatstroke Prevention
Taking steps to prevent canine heatstroke is important, whether your dog is especially prone to it or not. Here are just a few of the ways you can help keep your dog cool and healthy this summer.
- Avoid walking your dog when the temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. When it is over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, opt for indoor playtime instead of a long walk. If your dog needs to “go potty” when it is hot outside, keep the outing short and in the shade.
- Walk your dog in the early morning and after dusk. If you are not typically an “early bird,” then realize that in Nevada, you may have to become one in the summer if you want to walk your dog before the extreme heat arrives. You can also wait until temperatures drop after dusk to walk your dog.
- Always bring drinking water for your dog on your walks. Stop frequently on your walks to offer your dog cool water.
- Never leave your dog unattended in the heat. Even if there are shady areas in your backyard, never leave your dog outdoors unattended in the summer heat. Also, never leave them in a car alone, no matter how quickly you intend to return.
Signs of Heatstroke in Dogs
Heatstroke in dogs can be deadly, so it is important to seek emergency care for your dog as soon as they begin showing any of the following signs of the condition:
- Pale gums
- Excessive panting
- Shaking or seizing
- Rapid heart rate
- Excessive drooling
- Loss of consciousness
Once you notice heatstroke signs, move your dog to a cool area immediately, dampen their coat with a little lukewarm water if possible (water that is too cold can lower their internal temperature too fast, which can also harm them), and if they will, encourage them to take a few sips of water.
This is not an all-inclusive list of canine heatstroke signs, but just a few of the most common ones. In the end, if you know your dog well and they begin to act in a way that seems “strange” to you when they are in the heat, play it safe and take them to Animal Emergency Center for an exam. If your dog is suffering from heatstroke, our staff will work to lower their internal temperature slowly and perform any other steps necessary to return them to good health.",0.951748251914978,843,2.5726590156555176
"Selma, CA (October 13, 2014)-Poindexter Nut Company, a California walnut company, is unveiling its newly designed retail packaging line. The launch will begin this week at PMA Fresh Summit in Anaheim, CA and will be phased in gradually throughout 2015.
Featuring custom quick response (QR) codes on every bag, the new packaging was designed to engage customers through a mobile website. The custom branded codes were designed by MC Solutions along with the mobile website they point to.
Highlighting product information, industry facts and nutritional data, the QR codes also give consumers the opportunity to give back to the community by allowing them to select a non-proﬁt organization and Poindexter Nut Company will make a donation on their behalf. This initiative is Poindexter Nut Company’s most recent step taken to give back to the community and promote the importance of education, health, and whole-body wellness.
Poindexter Nut Company partnered with Ball Design to develop the new package design. Ball Design has a 30 year history in food and produce design, working with some of the largest companies in the agriculture industry.
Poindexter Nut Company’s new line of packaging was designed to have the ability to be a cross-merchandised item. The resealable, stand-up gusseted bags offer a strong shelf presence and the full width window allows for easy visibility of the product. Embellished with natural and earthly high quality graphic images on the outside, consumers can be assured the product inside is just as enticing.
“Over the last two years we have redesigned and improved every aspect of our business, from our new walnut processing facility to our packaging and retailing,” said Michael Poindexter, CEO of Poindexter Nut Company. “These new bags are on the marketing end of our development and represent our brand’s transformation.”

"In the realm of dermatological conditions, Blisterata stands out as a unique and often challenging skin disorder. Characterized by the formation of blisters on the skin’s surface, this condition can affect individuals of all ages, leading to discomfort and potential complications if not properly managed. This comprehensive guide aims to explore the causes, symptoms, treatment options, and preventive measures for Blisterata, providing valuable insights for patients and healthcare providers alike.

The dermatological disorder known as blisterrata is characterized by the development of fluid-filled blisters on the skin. Depending on the underlying reason, these blisters might vary in size and appear on various regions of the body. Numerous things, including infections, allergies, autoimmune diseases, and genetic predispositions, may cause blisters.
Causes of Blisterata
The development of Blisterata can be attributed to several potential causes, including:
- Infections: Viral infections such as herpes simplex and chickenpox can lead to blister formation. Bacterial infections like impetigo can also result in blisters.
- Allergic Reactions: Contact with allergens, such as poison ivy or certain chemicals, can cause an allergic reaction that manifests as blisters.
- Autoimmune Disorders: Conditions like pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid involve the immune system attacking healthy skin cells, resulting in blistering.
- Genetic Factors: Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to developing blistering skin conditions.
Symptoms of Blisterata
The primary symptom of Blisterata is the presence of blisters on the skin. These blisters may be accompanied by:
- Redness and Swelling: The affected area may appear red and swollen, indicating inflammation.
- Pain and Itching: Blisters can be painful or itchy, leading to discomfort and potential risk of infection if scratched.
- Fluid Discharge: In some cases, blisters may rupture, releasing clear or yellowish fluid.
- Crusting and Scabbing: As blisters heal, they may form crusts or scabs, which eventually fall off as new skin forms.
Diagnosis of Blisterata
Diagnosing Blisterata involves a thorough examination by a dermatologist, who may perform the following assessments:
- Physical Examination: The dermatologist will inspect the blisters and surrounding skin to assess their appearance and distribution.
- Medical History: A detailed medical history will help identify potential triggers or underlying conditions contributing to the blistering.
- Biopsy: In some cases, a skin biopsy may be conducted to examine a sample of the affected skin under a microscope, aiding in the diagnosis of autoimmune or genetic causes.
Treatment Options for Blisterata
Effective management of Blisterata requires a tailored approach based on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. Treatment options include:
- Topical Medications: Corticosteroid creams or ointments can reduce inflammation and alleviate itching. Antibiotic ointments may be prescribed if there is a risk of infection.
- Oral Medications: For more severe cases, oral corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs may be necessary to control the immune response.
- Antiviral or Antibiotic Therapy: If an infection is identified as the cause, appropriate antiviral or antibiotic medications will be prescribed.
- Lifestyle Modifications: Avoiding known allergens and irritants, wearing loose-fitting clothing, and maintaining proper skin hygiene can help manage symptoms.
Preventive Measures for Blisterata
Preventing the recurrence of Blisterata involves adopting proactive measures to protect the skin and minimize exposure to potential triggers:
- Identify Triggers: Keeping a diary of activities, foods, and products that precede blister outbreaks can help identify potential triggers to avoid.
- Protective Clothing: Wearing protective clothing and gloves can prevent contact with allergens and irritants.
- Skin Care Routine: Establishing a gentle skincare routine that includes moisturizing can help maintain the skin’s integrity and reduce the risk of blistering.
- Sun Protection: Applying sunscreen and wearing protective clothing when outdoors can prevent sunburn-related blistering.
Living with Blisterata
Although having blisters may be difficult, people can have happy, meaningful lives if they get the right care and assistance. A thorough treatment plan that is customized to each patient’s requirements must be developed in close collaboration with healthcare professionals.

"I slept through till three o’clock this morning then lay wide awake for a couple of hours before giving up trying to sleep and getting up.
Over brekkie I watched another episode of “Superstore” then sparked up the lap-top to see what was going on in the world. Yesterday my Facebook feed was awash with Monty Python memes; today it was daleks. Why?
As I drove to work on another very dark and wet morning the pundits on the radio were taking their orders from Dame Jane Goodall. Seen as the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees, Dame Jane was saying that all attempts on reversing climate change are doomed to failure until world poverty is sorted. She made a very convincing case that the environmental impact of my drive to work is just pissing in the wind compared to the wholesale deforestation that is going on across the world in the under-developed nations. That did soothe my conscience a tad. However offering millions of farmers living on subsistence level a better living than they can make from cutting down forests for farmlands will take some doing. Dame Jane seemed convinced that the idea was not only feasible but achievable, so there is hope for the future. Even if details were a little vague.
There was a lot of talk about how Prince Andrew should be crapping his pants in terror following yesterday's conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell.
Should he be? Has he actually interfered with children as has been implied on the radio? Perhaps he should talk to the FBI as has been suggested. Mind you if I was him I wouldn't go to talk to them; I'd invite the FBI to come to me. What with the media already having decided he's guilty he's far safer not setting foot on American soil regardless of whether or not he's actually done anything wrong.
It was still dark as I got to work, but as I walked away from my car the dawn chorus was in full swing. The birds were rather noisy this morning, and their songs were rather cheering. It made me think of a science fiction story I once read where on the fictional world of Yom there wasn't so much a dawn chorus as a ""quiet time"" when all the wildlife stopped singing and making noise and went quiet for an hour or so every afternoon. Whilst that was just a little novelty detail for the story, I've always found that idea rather scary.
Work was work, and with it done I came home. I am reliably informed I missed a major incident on the motorway by minutes. Had I left work a few moments later I would have been three hours late getting home.
“er indoors TM” boiled up a rather good bit of dinner which we scoffed whilst watching “The Greatest Showman”.
On New Year’s Eve in years gone by we would have gone to Folkestone and done it the Spanish way. But for the second year running we are doing it virtually via Zoom meeting. I’m going to wear my red New Year pants as a hat… with Maria fifteen miles away I will get away with it.
And that’s it for this year. I suppose that I should end with a look-back at this last year, shouldn’t I? The highlight must have been the wonderful holiday we had in Lincolnshire over the summer, and I had a rather good afternoon tea for my birthday, and once a month we had fun family Zoom bingo-quiz nights. We had an amazing stag do over the August Bank Holiday and an excellent Christmas Day and Boxing Day with the fruits of my loin. And the new telly and the new car weren’t too shabby either.
Sadly what with the (laughably made-up-as-we-went-along) lockdown regulations thwarting plans, I spent a lot of time and *lot* of money in the garden this year, and it was April before we were able to meet up to go for a decent walk with friends. But much as I do look forward to our walks, the weather was against us for much of the year. We had quite a few really good weekend walks, but we did get soaked on the Romney Marsh a couple of times and had to call off more walks this year than ever before.
I did manage to organise two geocaching trips to London both of which went rather well (even if I do say so myself) and we had two rather good geocaching meet-ups.
But it hasn’t been the best of years, has it? Last New Year’s Eve I mentioned about how “I try to hope for the best whilst expecting the worst” and that really was how the year panned out for me. It started off with lots of rather horrible drives through ice (and even snow) to the hospice, and when that was all over I was to and from the in-patient department of the vet’s. Closer to home, but far more expensive. Ending the year with half the dogs and half the parents I started the year with, I also lost three old friends too.
So… what does the future hold? Tomorrow I’m staging the first local geocaching meet of the year and I’m hoping that we might re-boot the noble and ancient art of rummaging under rocks for film pots. We’ve got quite a few meets planned for the New Year.
In less than two weeks I’m due to have surgery - another nasal re-bore. I can’t pretend to be looking forward to that.
We are off to Norfolk for a week just before Easter.
We’ve got a holiday in Grand Canaria in June which I suspect will be cancelled.
We’ve got a week in the New Forest in August… I got the confirmation confirmation of the time off from work today.
So again I shall hope for the best… and be rather circumspect about that which I might expect. See you all next year…",0.9853265285491943,1245,1.0154166221618652

Questions on regulations and their interpretation pertaining to studies at the graduate level should be addressed to the Dean of Graduate Division.
Students planning to graduate should familiarize themselves with the dates relating to application for graduation and other pertinent deadlines (see the “Calendar”). It is necessary to apply for graduation by the specified deadline in order to graduate in a particular term, whether or not the student plans to attend the commencement ceremonies.
Students must satisfy the degree requirements of the Catalog in force during the term for which they were admitted; or they may, with the consent of their advisors, meet graduation requirements by complying with the provisions of a later Catalog. Students readmitted to a degree program must meet degree requirements of the Catalog in force at the time of the later admission (or of a subsequent Catalog, as provided above). Aside from degree requirements, all students are subject to the regulations and policies stated in the Catalog currently in force. Exceptions to the regulations contained in the Catalog require the written approval of Graduate Division, unless otherwise stated in the Catalog.
All written work should observe high editorial standards, and high standards of academic honesty are expected. Though advisory services are provided to assist the student, the student alone is responsible for following the procedures and completing the steps required in the degree program. Requirements of Graduate Division, both procedural and substantive, may be waived only by written request of the student and/or committee and supported by the graduate chair concerned. Written approval from Graduate Division for all such requests is required. Petition forms are available in department offices, the Graduate Division Student Services Office, and online at manoa.hawaii.edu/graduate/.
UH Manoa has adopted policies and procedures for dealing with academic (and research) misconduct by its students, faculty, and staff. The guidelines, which are available in department offices and in the office of the Dean of Graduate Division, pertain to the intentional commission of any academic misconduct, including falsification of research results, improper assignment of authorship, plagiarism, deceptive manipulation of experiments or of research procedures, and misappropriation of research funds.
If a graduate student fails to maintain the standards of academic or professional integrity expected in his or her discipline or program, the student’s admission to the program may be terminated. (See “Campus Policies” for further discussion of policy pertaining to academic honesty.)
Research with Human or Animal Subjects
Students intending to conduct research using human or animal subjects should be aware of federal, state, and UH Manoa regulations and review processes to ensure compliance with protective standards. These regulations cover research funded by non-UH Manoa sources, sponsored by UH Manoa, or conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent of UH Maânoa in connection with his or her institutional responsibilities or using any UH Manoa property or facility. These regulations also cover research involving the use of UH Manoa’s non-public information to identify or contact research subjects.
Students and UH Manoa employees should refer to the “Campus Policies” section for more information on federal research guidelines and check with their respective graduate chairperson for guidance.
Applicants for advanced degree programs must hold a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited U.S. college or university or its equivalent from a recognized foreign institution of higher learning. The standards of the degree in question must be equivalent in both the distribution of academic subject matter and in scholarship achievement requirements to those maintained at UH Manoa.
All applicants should have outstanding academic records. The evaluation is based on the applicant’s academic record, as well as test scores, the statement of objectives, and where appropriate, professional experience. Applicants may submit unofficial copies of transcripts and test scores while applying for admissions. However, admitted students are required to submit official transcripts and test scores in order to enroll at UH Manoa.
Completed applications are screened by the Graduate Student Services Office. Applications that meet the requirements of Graduate Division are forwarded to the respective graduate program, where the standards applied may be more stringent than those set by Graduate Division. There the applications are subjected to a more comprehensive and intensive review by the graduate faculty. Where admission is intensely competitive, admission decisions are reached through a comparison of the relative merits of all applicants applying in the program or in an area of concentration, if applicable, for that particular semester. The graduate program then makes a recommendation to
Graduate Division either to admit or deny the applicant. The final decision to make a formal offer of admission rests with Graduate Division, which takes into full consideration the recommendation of the graduate program. Admission is valid only for the semester in which the student was accepted.
Applicants may be denied admission for any number of reasons. Some of the more common bases of denial are undistinguished academic records and poor test scores, inadequate preparation and background for advanced academic or professional study, unclear or unfocused objectives for graduate study, or inability of the program to accommodate all qualified applicants due to limited space or lack of faculty to guide the students in specified areas of interest. It is suggested that applicants consult the chair of the selected program concerning their interests and availability of faculty members in their intended areas of study.
Graduate Student Services Office notifies each applicant of the decision. Official notification of acceptance or rejection is generally mailed between February and June for fall admission, depending on when the completed application is received and when a decision is reached. Most of the notifications are mailed in April and May. For spring, notification is generally between October and December. In programs with intense competition, selections are often made early. Applicants should not make definite arrangements to attend UH Manoa until they receive formal notice of acceptance from Graduate Division.
All applicants are required to specify on the application form all current and previous enrollment in any postsecondary institution. Any applicant who fails to inform UH Manoa of such enrollment or who submits or has submitted any required information or document that is fraudulent or that has been altered without proper authorization may be denied admission to UH Manoa. If the omissions and/or alterations are discovered after the student is enrolled, enrollment may be canceled and the student will be referred to UH Manoa’s Student Conduct Committee for possible disciplinary action.
Application Procedures and Deadlines
You may apply for graduate admission by downloading an application form or by electronic application from the website listed below. Specific program information should be obtained directly from the appropriate graduate program. For a listing of graduate programs contact information, visit the website: manoa.hawaii.edu/graduate. Communication should be addressed to the graduate chair of the appropriate graduate program.
For further information on general graduate admissions, write or email the Graduate Student Services Office at firstname.lastname@example.org. College/schools of business, medicine, and law are not part of Graduate Division. Applicants should apply directly to the Shidler College of Business, John A. Burns School of Medicine, or to the William S. Richardson School of Law.
Students applying for admission to graduate programs must submit the following:
To Graduate Division
- On-line application form and application fee–no fee waivers;
- One official transcript from each postsecondary institution attended, sent directly from the institution to Graduate Student Services or received in a sealed institutional envelope. Transcripts are NOT required for course work completed at any of the UH campuses. The Graduate Student Services Office will obtain UH transcripts on behalf of applicants;
- Official Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or IELTS Academic Modules Test score report, if required (for international applicants, as well as some immigrant and U.S. applicants); and
- Verification of financial status (for international applicants).
If more than 25 percent of a student’s undergraduate course work at a U.S. institution has been graded under a nontraditional grading system (i.e., pass/fail, credit/no credit, satisfactory/unsatisfactory, etc.), then:
- Transcripts must be accompanied by official course performance reports, i.e., faculty evaluations (one copy each of transcripts and performance reports);
- Transcripts from nontraditional grading systems must include course descriptions and grade conversion information; and
- If the applicant must take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test, forward test results to Graduate Division. [Applicants to the School of Travel Industry Management may take the GMAT instead of the GRE.]
To the Graduate Program
- Letters of recommendation if required by the graduate program;
- One official transcript from each postsecondary institution attended, sent directly to the graduate program by the institution, if required by the graduate program;
- Standardized test scores (excluding TOEFL and IELTS) such as GRE, GMAT, if required by the graduate program;
- Special application forms, statement of objectives and long-range goals if required by the graduate program; and
- Samples of work (slides, manuscripts, portfolio, or tapes), résumés, and writing samples if required by the graduate program.
For details, refer to the specific graduate program brochure and application instructions. Materials submitted in support of an application are not released for other purposes and cannot be returned to the applicant. Failure to fill out the application completely according to instructions may result in delays and/or file closure.
Please refer to the Graduate Division Prospective Student section at manoa.hawaii.edu/graduate/ or specific graduate program brochure for specific application deadlines. Each graduate program may have different deadlines and some programs do not have spring admissions.
In many cases, admission offers include financial support, such as assistantships, scholarships, fellowships, and tuition waivers. Frequently, this support is awarded early to highly qualified applicants. Applications are processed by Graduate Student Services Office as early as August 1 for the fall semester and May 1 for the spring semester. It is recommended that a completed graduate admissions application be submitted as early as possible.
International applicants must submit official academic records in the original language accompanied by certified English translations. These translations must bear either the embossed seal or inked stamp of the issuing institution or governmental agency or the original signature of the translator, and they must be complete and exact word-for-word translations of the original documents.
The following lists the minimum academic qualifications expected of international applicants from the following selected countries or areas for admissions consideration. These qualifications must be completed prior to enrollment. Not all regions and countries are represented and admission eligibility is determined upon review of all required application materials.
- Australia, Canada, South Africa: Bachelor’s degree requiring at least four years of study or an honours bachelor degree.
- Baltic and East European States, former Soviet Republics: Diplom, Inzenyr, Magister, Oklevél: diploma requiring four to five years of post-secondary study.
- Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan: Completed master’s degree at the time of application or a four-five year bachelor’s degree such as the B. Engineering, B. Technology, or B. Agriculture.
- United Kingdom and British patterned systems: Honours bachelor degree.
- France or French patterned systems: Maîtrise or title of Ingênieur; four-five year degree.
- Germany: University Diplom, Magister Artium, or Staatsexamen. The vordiplom alone is not sufficient.
- Philippines: Bachelor’s degree from chartered higher education institutions (state universities and colleges) or CHED approved institutions and degree programs or FAAP certified level II or III accreditation status.
- Bologna-compliant three year bachelor degrees will be given consideration.
If admitted, international students must receive two clearances in order to register: (1) University Health Services clearance documenting adherence with health regulations; and (2) International Student Services (ISS) clearance documenting adherence to international student regulations and proof of adequate health insurance. Note: International applicants with a non-immigrant visa status other than student status should contact the ISS. Federal restrictions on full-time study may apply.
Concurrent Pursuit of Multiple Graduate Programs
Current UH Manoa graduate students who wish to pursue an additional graduate degree concurrently are required to obtain advance approval from their program chair and the Graduate Dean. Upon approval, students may apply for admission to an additional program after completing one semester of study in their initial program.
Students must submit the Petition to Apply for Concurrent Degree to their current program chair for approval prior to applying for an additional graduate program. It is recommended that the petition be submitted at least two weeks prior to the program’s admission deadline. The petition is located on the Graduate Division website at manoa.hawaii.edu/graduate/.
Upon approval from the graduate chair, the student submits the approved petition, a new graduate admissions application, and the application fee to the Graduate Student Services Office. Approval of this petition only grants permission to apply and does not imply admission.
Approval is not required to apply to official dual degrees or to graduate certificate programs. Duplicate Masters and Doctoral degrees in the same field are not permitted. In addition, concurrent doctoral degrees are not allowed. To consider an additional degree in the same field, the course work must be different in its entirety and it must represent of a unique body of knowledge that is required. Relatedly, each dissertation, thesis, or project must be distinct enough from the first degree and cannot incorporate parts of the previously written work. Concurrent doctorates are not permitted and multiple doctoral degrees are generally not permitted. If approved, each degree must be distinct, and representing a unique body of knowledge. Each dissertation must be distinct and not incorporate parts of a previous dissertation.
Concurrent Graduate Certificates
Current UH Manoa graduate students who wish to pursue an additional graduate certificate concurrently are required to apply directly to the Graduate Student Services Office. The Concurrent Graduate Certificate Program application can be downloaded from the Graduate Division website at manoa.hawaii.edu/graduate/. The application and application fee must be submitted to the Graduate Student Services Office, 2540 Maile Way, Spalding 353B, Honolulu, HI 96822.
English Language Institute
International and immigrant students admitted to UH Manoa whose native language is not English may be referred to the English Language Institute to determine if they must take the ELI placement examinations. If a student does not fulfill this obligation, ELI will place a hold on the student’s registration. Please refer to the “English as a Second Language” section within the Colleges of Arts and Sciences for additional information.
Standardized test application forms are available at the Counseling and Student Development Center, (808) 956-3454. Out-of-state students and applicants from international countries should write to the address designated for each examination (see pertinent section).
Individuals with visual, physical, hearing, or learning disabilities who are required to take either the GRE or GMAT should contact the Educational Testing Service for information regarding special arrangements to take these examinations.
Graduate Record Examination
The GRE and subtests may be required by some graduate programs and recommended by others. For the requirements of the individual graduate programs, consult the relevant graduate program descriptions in this Catalog. The GRE General Test (Package 1) is also required by Graduate Division for students who have completed 25 percent or more of their undergraduate work at a U.S. institution under a nontraditional grading system. Test information is available through the Counseling and Student Development Center, (808) 956-3454. Applicants may request test registration forms directly from Graduate Record Examinations, Educational Testing Service (ETS), Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541-6000, web: www.ets.org/gre/. Submit completed registration forms and test fees to ETS at least one month before the examination date.
Evidence of English Language Proficiency
Applicants whose native language is not English must submit official Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores or International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic Modules test results. The TOEFL score report and IELTS test results must be from a test taken within the last 2 years. A minimum TOEFL score of 500/61 (paper/internet) or IELTS overall band test result of 6.00 is required. Many programs require higher scores. The minimum score for teaching assistantship applicants is 600/100 for TOEFL and 7.00 for the IELTS.
Applicants who have completed a bachelor’s or advanced degree program within the last five years at a regionally accredited/recognized institution in the U.S., Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, or United Kingdom need not submit English language proficiency test scores.
Final admission requires submission of the official TOEFL/IELTS results. Applicants should, therefore, obtain the TOEFL Bulletin of Information early to check on the availability of the test and should take the test in time to meet graduate admissions application deadlines.
The TOEFL is administered at centers throughout the world. Applicants who wish to take the TOEFL outside the U.S. should obtain the TOEFL Bulletin of Information for Candidates, International Edition. This bulletin is generally available at U.S. embassies and consulates and at binational educational commissions and consulates abroad. Applicants may also order a bulletin directly from the representative who serves the area or country in which they plan to take the test. For complete information about the TOEFL, visit ets.org/toefl/.
International English Language Testing System (IELTS)
Applicants should contact the nearest British Council/Embassy/Consulate or IDP Education Australia Office in their country for the nearest testing center. It is advised that you also check the IELTS website for the most up-to-date information for testing centers. Web: ielts.org/.
Additional Requirements and Information
Newly accepted students who do not register in the program during the semester for which they are admitted or who withdraw from all courses within the designated withdrawal period (see the “Calendar” for designated withdrawal dates) are considered no-shows and their admission status is rendered invalid. A new application is required for readmission consideration.
Change in Graduate Program
Applicants for a change in program are considered in competition with all other applicants to the new field. East-West Center students must consult their program officer before initiating any changes in graduate programs. The applicant must submit a Graduate Admissions application along with all documentation required by the new program (letters of recommendation, transcripts, test scores, etc.) to the Graduate Student Services Office within the standard admission deadlines for the graduate program. [If a change is granted, it becomes effective in the following semester contingent upon receipt of the Statement of Intention to Register (SIR) form.]
Students who are admitted to a new program are considered to be withdrawing from their current program. A student may return to the current graduate program only by petition to, and approval of, the graduate program and Graduate Division.
Classified graduate students who wish to re-enroll after a lapse in enrollment of one or more semesters must apply for readmission. The readmission application form is found at: manoa.hawaii.edu/graduate/. The following documents must be submitted to the Graduate Student Services Office by the established deadlines:
- Application form;
- Application fee;
- Confidential Financial Statement for International Applicants (if applicable);
- Transcripts reflecting any studies since last admission to the UH Manoa Graduate Division; and
- Any other material requested by the graduate program (e.g., current test scores).
Students who are readmitted will be subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of readmission.
Applications and supporting documents in the following categories are retained by the Graduate Student Services Office for limited periods as indicated:
- Incomplete applications–two years.
- Applications with no action taken by graduate program; denials (those denied admission); no-shows (those not enrolled in the semester of admission); transcripts and test scores (TOEFL scores, master file of GRE scores)–two years.
- Academic records of graduated students–five years.
- Academic records of inactive students–seven years.
Classification of Students
Only students who have been admitted to an advanced degree, certificate program, or special non-degree program by Graduate Division are designated as classified (regular or special non-degree) graduate students.
Regular Graduate Student
An applicant will be eligible for admission as a “regular” classified graduate student if he or she has the following:
- A GPA of 3.0 or better in the last four semesters or approximately 60 semester credits (or the equivalent in quarter credits) of work as an undergraduate;
- A master’s degree with a GPA of 3.0 or better; or
- A GPA of 3.0 or better in at least 12 credit hours of relevant upper division and/or graduate-level post-baccalaureate work.
Students who have taken courses after receiving a bachelor’s degree and whose GPA for 12 or more credit hours of upper division and/or graduate-level post-baccalaureate work is below 3.0 are not generally admissible even if they meet the minimum GPA requirements in category 1. International students with a GPA of less than a B average in their undergraduate work and/or less than a B average in 12 credit hours of post-baccalaureate work are generally not admissible.
Students whose bachelor’s and/or master’s degrees were incomplete at the time they filed applications for admission are “conditionally admitted” graduate students. They must submit an official transcript certifying completion of their degree to the Graduate Student Services Office. This must be submitted within 60 days after the award of the degree. Registration will be denied for the following semester to those who fail to meet this requirement.
Post-Baccalaureate Unclassified Students
Individuals who wish to take UH Manoa courses as a post-baccalaureate unclassified (PBU) student, must apply to the Graduate Student Services Office, University of Hawai‘i at Manoa, 2540 Maile Way, Spalding Hall 353B, Honolulu, HI 96822. (International applicants on an F-1 Student VISA are not eligible to apply.)
Students must submit an online application, application fee, and an official transcript verifying degree conferral of a bachelor’s degree or advanced degree, from a regionally accredited U.S. college or university or its equivalent from a recognized foreign institution of higher learning. Applicants who received their bachelor’s degree from a foreign institution are also required to submit official Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores or International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic Modules test results.
Applicants may download the PBU application from the Graduate Division website at manoa.hawaii.edu/graduate/ or complete the graduate online application and select Post-Baccalaureate Unclassified as their intended program. Admission as an unclassified post-baccalaureate student does not constitute admissions as a classified student, nor does it guarantee future admissions as a classified student to a degree program. PBU students may not be eligible for certain benefits and services such as Veterans Affairs benefits, social security benefits, some types of federal financial aid, etc. PBU students are subject to graduate tuition rates. PBU students will need approval to take 600-800 level courses at UH Manoa.
Students who take course work at the graduate level in a summer session but who have not been admitted to an advanced degree program at UH Manoa register as post-baccalaureate unclassified students. However, appropriate but limited credit hours earned from summer session courses while in unclassified status prior to admission to Graduate Division are countable toward an advanced degree at the recommendation of the graduate programs involved. See “Post-Baccalaureate Unclassified Students” above.
Application for admission to a summer session should be made to Outreach College, University of Hawai ‘i at Manoa, 2440 Campus Road, Box 447, Honolulu, HI 96822. Admission to a summer session does not imply or guarantee eventual admission to Graduate Division.
Information on registration procedures is contained with the Office of the Registrar at manoa.hawaii.edu/records, which includes registration dates and instructions. The listing of course offerings with up-to-date class location and meeting times is found at the Class Availability website: sis.hawaii.edu/uhdad/.
Students may register for credit hours through the last day of registration. There is a fee for late registration.
The late registration period is also the final time for classified graduate students to register to audit graduate courses, in accordance with the procedures outlined under “Course Auditing.”
Classified graduate students may audit courses with the consent of the instructor. An audit approval form, available in the graduate program department office, must be completed and presented for registration. Audit courses are entered on student transcripts with a grade of L and are included in the tuition calculation. Audit courses may not be used for purposes of determining full-time or part-time enrollment status or graduate assistantship eligibility.
Refer to the Office of the Registrar for complete information regarding procedures for course changes.
Withdrawal from Courses
Refer to the Office of the Registrar for complete information regarding procedures for withdrawal from courses.
To withdraw from all courses prior to the beginning of classes, students should consult with the department and follow directions found in the Office of the Registrar.
Continuing students who withdraw from all courses after classes begin must obtain a Complete Withdrawal Form from the Graduate Student Services Office, obtain the necessary signatures as indicated on the form, and turn in the completed form to the UH Manoa Cashier’s Office, Queen Lili‘uokalani Center for Student Services 105. A semester in which a cancellation or withdrawal is made is considered a semester of nonattendance. Thus, students must petition for readmission or file a renewal application, whichever is appropriate, to return to their studies in the same program. Petitions for readmission and renewal applications are considered along with all new applications for that semester. Students who are readmitted will be subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of readmission.
Newly admitted students who cancel or withdraw from all courses before the drop period ends (see the Office of the Registrar for the date) are considered “no shows,” and their admission status becomes invalid. To return, they must reapply for admission. Newly admitted students who withdraw after the drop period (see the Office of the Registrar for the date) must complete a Petition for Readmission form if they wish to return the following semester. Petitions for readmission are considered along with all new applications for admission for that semester. Students who are readmitted will be subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of readmission.
Faculty will verify attendance of students registered in their courses by the end of the first week of each semester. Students who fail to attend class (“no show”) will be dropped from that class and will have their financial aid recalculated accordingly.
Retroactive withdrawals are partial or complete course withdrawals processed after the semester has ended. UH Manoa is obligated to ensure the integrity of the transcript as an historical document, which must reflect the actual history of a student’s experience at UH Manoa. Because of this, the student who is requesting a retroactive withdrawal will need to present a convincing case and provide relevant documentation that supports the existence of circumstances beyond their control that prevented them from initiating the withdrawal request in a timely manner. Any request after two years of the course ending will not be reviewed. Should a retroactive withdrawal be approved, the action will result in the grade being changed to a W. Tuition refunds will not be considered and any academic action applied for that semester will remain on the student’s record. Students who were financial aid recipients during the semester in which they are seeking a withdrawal should check with Financial Aid Services to determine if this will result in a financial obligation or will result in future ineligibility for financial aid.
Failure to Withdraw
If students cease to attend classes without officially withdrawing, they will receive final grades at the instructors’ discretion. If the instructor does not award a grade, an F or NC will be assigned.
Denial of Registration
Graduate Education will deny further registration to any student whose course work is below the required level or who is not making satisfactory academic progress.
After admission, students must be enrolled at UH Manoa every fall and spring semester for course work, thesis, dissertation, or research credit. Students graduating in summer must be enrolled in at least one session. Students who are neither enrolled nor on approved leaves of absence will be regarded as withdrawn from their degree programs. They will be required to apply for readmission in accordance with established regulations if they wish to resume their studies.
Leave of Absence
A leave of absence for a period of time no longer than one calendar year may be granted to currently enrolled students in good standing (minimum GPA of 3.0) after (1) completion of at least one semester of course work relevant to the degree as a classified graduate student, and (2) upon recommendation of the chair of the graduate program and approval by Graduate Division. The date of return from a leave must be set at the time the leave is requested. Forms are available on the website.
Students must withdraw from courses if requesting a leave of absence. Students not returning from leave on time will be required to petition for readmission to UH Manoa in accordance with the established regulations. Students who are readmitted will be subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of readmission.
Students on approved leave do not pay tuition or fees. No leave should be requested if the student will be using UH Manoa facilities or faculty or staff services. Time on approved leave is not counted against the seven-year limit for completion of degree programs.
Students on probation are not granted an approved leave of absence.
One (1) credit hour over a standard 15-week semester is equivalent to:
- One semester hour of direct instruction and two hours of out-of-class work, which may include reading, writing, and course-related assignments. (For example, a three-credit course will require three (3) semester hours of direct instruction (contact hours), and six (6) hours of out-of-class work per week.); or
- Three semester hours of nontraditional course work, which may include laboratory work, internship, practicum, studio work, independent study, fieldwork, online and hybrid-delivered courses. (For example, a three-credit nontraditional course will require nine (9) semester hours of course work and/or direct instruction per week.)
Courses offered during Summer Sessions, Extension Semesters, and in other accelerated formats are prorated so that classes have the equivalent number of semester hours as if the course were scheduled during a regular 15-week semester.
Sixteen credit hours in a semester and 8 credit hours in a six-week summer session are considered maximum course loads and may be exceeded only with the approval of the graduate chair and Graduate Division. The minimum full-time load for graduate students is 8 credit hours of course work. Courses taken for audit do not count toward determining full- or part-time enrollment status.
Eligible doctoral candidates may be considered as carrying a full academic load (full-time status) when enrolled for 1 credit hour of Dissertation 800.
Eligible master’s candidates may be considered as carrying a full academic load (full-time status) when enrolled for 1 credit hour of Thesis 700F after completing all required credits for the graduate degree including the program’s requirements for Thesis 700.
For graduate assistants, the full-time load is 6 credit hours of course work relevant to their degree. Audit hours do not count toward the minimum. Because their duties ordinarily require 20 hours per week, they are restricted to a maximum of 9 credit hours. However, with special permission from the graduate chair and Graduate Division, graduate assistants may register for 12 credit hours, including audits.
Variable Credit Courses
The number of credit hours obtainable in most courses is stated in this Catalog. Certain courses, designated (V) in Catalog course listings, offer variable credit. Students in these courses usually pursue individual work. The number of credit hours a student will earn in such a course must be approved by the instructor at the time of registration. Students must register for a definite number of credit hours and may earn no more or less than the stated number.
Graduate Credit for Seniors
Seniors at UH may earn credit toward an advanced degree for some courses completed during their last semester as undergraduates provided (1) the courses taken are in excess of the requirement for the bachelor’s degree, and (2) such courses fulfill requirements in the prospective graduate field. A Petition for Submission of Credit Toward an Advanced Degree for Courses Taken by an Undergraduate form is available at the Graduate Student Services Office, Spalding 353B and on the web. It must be approved by the academic advisor, the college dean, and the chair of the department in which the course is offered, and it must be filed with the Graduate Student Services Office during the registration period. The granting of such permission does not guarantee that the credit hours taken will be accepted by a graduate program as fulfilling degree requirements. Courses taken under this rule are counted in the graduate GPA at the time of graduation. Failure to complete the baccalaureate degree as scheduled nullifies any approval granted by Graduate Division.
Credit by Examination
Graduate students may obtain credit by examination in courses numbered 300-498 (excluding 399) with the approval of the chair of the graduate program, the instructor concerned, and Graduate Division, subject to general UH regulations and procedures. There is no limit on the number of examinations that a graduate student may take during any one semester. Credit may not be obtained by examination in courses numbered 600 or above.
Extension and Correspondence Course Credits
No graduate credit is allowed for extension and correspondence courses.
Undergraduate deficiencies are courses required by a graduate program, prerequisites, or other requirements for admission that the student did not complete prior to admission. Courses in directed research/reading are not to be used to make up deficiencies.
Transfer of Credits
Credits from institutions other than UH Manoa or taken as a post-baccalaureate unclassified (PBU) at UH Manoa can be considered for transfer upon submission of (1) a memo approved by the chair of the graduate program, or (2) the Petition to Transfer/Substitute Credits form, which is available on the web.
Courses being considered from institutions other than UH Manoa must be accompanied by an official transcript, transcript guide, and course syllabus if substituting for a required course.
Doctoral students may not transfer credits. Graduate certificate students may transfer six UH Manoa PBU credits.
Policy Governing Transfer of Credits from Other Institutions
- The request for transfer of credit hours must be made during the first semester the student is enrolled in the program.
- Only credit hours from an accredited university are transferable.
- Regardless of the number of credits transferred, more than half of the total number of credits used to fulfill master’s degree requirements must be earned at UH Manoa while enrolled as a graduate student. For example, if the master’s degree requires 30 credits total, 16 or more credits must be earned at UH Manoa while enrolled as a graduate student.
- With approval from the graduate program and Graduate Division, up to 6 credit hours of work completed at another accredited institution following advancement to candidacy at UH Manoa may be transferred, providing such transfer does not exceed the maximum allowable.
- Credit hours used to obtain a previous degree will not be transferred.
- No credit hours may be transferred from another institution unless the grade is B- or better. Course grades of S, CR, and P are not transferable.
- Credit hours to be transferred must have been completed within seven years preceding the date upon which the advanced degree is to be conferred by UH Manoa.
- Quarter credit hours are converted to semester hours by using this formula: 2/3 times number of quarter credit hours equals number of semester credit hours (rounding off to the lower whole number). Conversion is done by the Graduate Student Services Office and is calculated for the total credit hours requested for transfer rather than for individual course credit hours.
- Credit hours earned in international institutions must be certified by the departments as to the equivalent level of the courses being transferred (i.e., whether 300-398, 400-498, or 600-798 level).
- The minimum residence requirement of full-time study must be upheld regardless of the number of credit hours transferred to UH Manoa.
- Transfer of courses to meet practicum, seminar, thesis, or dissertation requirements is not permitted.
- Extension credits from other universities are not transferable.
- Directed reading/directed research credits (x99) are not transferable.
- Transfer credits are not included in GPA calculations except for the final calculations when the student graduates.
If the petition is approved, the units (or UH Manoa equivalent) will be counted as part of the student’s degree program.
A student who pursues two distinct master’s degrees at UH Manoa, either simultaneously or consecutively, may apply to have up to 6 credit hours of graduate course work accepted for credit in both degree programs under the following provisions:
- The courses being double counted are electives in both programs;
- Written approval of the graduate chairs of both programs (only approval by the second chair is required if the degrees are being pursued sequentially) and Graduate Division is obtained; and
- The course work for each degree is completed within the prescribed time limits.
A student in a UH Manoa-approved “dual degree” program who fails to meet the academic requirements specified for that program will be dismissed from the dual degree program and Graduate Division.
The schedule of final examinations is available at undergrad/schedule/. No examinations (other than laboratory tests and short quizzes) are allowed during the two weeks prior to the final examination period.
Student achievement is designated by: A+, A, A- (high achievement), B+, B, B- (meets expectations), C+, C, C-, (below expectations), D+, D, D- (inadequate performance), F (failure), CR (credit), NC (no credit), NG (no grade and work in progress), S (satisfactory), and I (incomplete). L is the designation given to audited courses. Grades lower than C- may not be used to fulfill requirements for advanced degrees.
An I is given to students who fail to complete a small but important part of a semester’s work before the semester grades are determined, if the instructor believes that the failure was caused by conditions beyond the student’s control and not by carelessness and procrastination. Students are expected to complete all courses. Therefore, students receiving an I should contact the instructor to determine the steps to be taken to remove the I. The deadline for removing an I received in the fall semester is the following April 1; for removing an I received in the spring semester or the summer session, the deadline is the following November 1.
Instructors who record a grade of I for undergraduate courses (100-499) must also record the grade that will replace the I if the work is not made up by the deadline; that grade is computed on the basis of what grades or other evidence the instructors have, averaged together with Fs for all incomplete work (including the final examination, if it is not taken). This alternate grade may be the appropriate letter grade, or if the course was taken under credit/no credit (CR/NC). (The designation W cannot be used as an alternate grade.)
Instructors who record a grade of I for graduate courses (600-799, excluding 700) have the option of recording an alternate grade to replace the I if the work is not made up by the deadline. This includes courses taken for letter grade or for CR/NC. If the instructor chooses to record an incomplete for a graduate course with no alternate grade, the instructor may (1) allow the grade of I to remain permanently unaltered on the student’s record; (2) submit to the Office of the Registrar a change-of-grade form, with the grade computed on the basis of work completed by the deadline noted above; (3) after the deadline for removing the I, at the student’s request submit a Change of Grade form to the Graduate Student Services Office requesting a conversion of the I to a grade. Such conversions may be permitted on a case-by-case basis only during the two semesters immediately following the semester in which the I was received. After that period, the I will be permanent.
If work for a course in which an I has been assigned is completed prior to the deadline, the instructor will report a change of grade, taking the completed work into consideration. A grade of F or NC, as appropriate, will be assigned in those cases where an instructor has not assigned a grade to a student who has never attended or has ceased to attend class without officially withdrawing.
Change of Grades
Grades may be changed only within one full academic year following the end of the semester in which the course was completed. To change a grade, the course instructor completes and submits a Change of Grade form to the Graduate Student Services Office. The instructor must state the reason for the grade change on the form and sign the form. “Additional work submitted” is not an acceptable reason for changing a grade.
Solely for the purpose of graduate academic actions in the computing of the GPA of students who retake a course that is otherwise non-repeatable, only the most recent grade will be included.
Students switching from either Plan A or Plan B to Plan C must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 in all courses completed (300-398, 400-498, 600-798). Credit hours taken under the credit/no credit option (except 699) while under Plan C will not be counted toward degree requirements for either Plan A or Plan B.
Credit/No Credit Option
The major purpose of the credit/no credit option is to encourage students to broaden their education by venturing into subject areas outside their fields of specialization without hazarding a relatively low grade. Under the option, students receive grades of CR (credit) or NC (no credit). These do not carry grade points and, therefore, are not computed in the student’s GPA.
The option must be exercised at the time of registration and only under the following conditions:
- Except as noted, courses taken under the CR/NC option may not be applied toward the requirements for the master’s degree. Only 699 directed reading/research courses may be taken on CR/NC at the option of the graduate program and may be granted credit toward a master’s degree within the limits already prescribed by Graduate Division (see master’s degree requirements, Plan A and Plan B).
- A course for which a grade of NC is received may be retaken under the CR/NC option.
- The CR designation in the non-letter grade system denotes C caliber work or better.
- The NC designation and the course in which it is received will appear in official records as part of the student’s academic history.
- The NC designation affects neither the credit hour total nor the grade point total of the student.
Requirements for Continued Registration
To remain eligible for further graduate work and to be awarded a graduate degree, students must maintain progress towards completion of their programs and must have a B average (3.0 GPA) for all courses completed at UH Manoa applicable to the degree. Students must also have a B average for all courses taken as a classified graduate student and for all graduate courses numbered 600 and above.
Graduate Division disregards grades or credit hours for courses numbered 100-198, 200-298, 399, and 499, except those required to fulfill undergraduate deficiencies.
Satisfactory academic progress in a program also involves maintaining the academic and professional standards expected in a particular discipline or program; failure to maintain these standards may result in termination of student’s admission to the program.
Fulfillment of Credit Hour Requirements
Credit hour requirements for graduate degrees can only be fulfilled by grades of A, B, and C. Grades of A, B, C, and CR can be used to make up undergraduate deficiencies. Grades of CR for 699 directed reading or research courses are counted in credit hour requirements within stated rules but are not computed for GPAs. Grades of NC are neither counted nor computed. Grades of D and F are not counted toward the completion of requirements for advanced degrees but are computed in the GPA, along with grades for all courses taken to satisfy undergraduate deficiencies and courses counted toward advanced degrees.
Probation and Dismissal
A regular student whose cumulative GPA fails to meet the minimum requirements after completing at least 8 credit hours of course work will be placed on academic probation for the following semester. The student must be registered in the semester he or she is placed on probation.
If admitted by exception for GPA since admission fails to meet the minimum requirements after completing one semester of course work, the student will be placed on academic probation for the following semester. (ESL students are subject to dismissal.)
All grades for courses taken during the probationary semester, as well as the grades for all previously taken classified credits, will be included in calculating the GPA at the end of the probationary semester. No extensions of the probationary semester may be granted due to incompletes I.
A student on academic probation who fails to attain the minimum standards at the end of the probationary semester will be denied further registration in that program.
For purposes of these rules, a “semester” is the calendar period, regardless of the number of credit hours taken.
For students pursuing approved concurrent graduate degree programs, the requirements stated above are applicable to both programs but will be applied toward each program independently.
Policy on Reinstatement after Dismissal
To be reinstated to the same program after academic dismissal, the student must submit completed readmission forms to the Graduate Student Services Office and meet the standard admission criteria applicable to the graduate program. The graduate program must submit a petition to Graduate Division on the student’s behalf, providing strong justification for the action. If reinstated, all courses applicable to the degree are subject to the seven year rule (i.e., must be completed within seven years of the date the degree is to be awarded) and the student will be subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of reinstatement.
To be admitted to a new program after academic dismissal or voluntary withdrawal, the student must submit a new application to the Graduate Student Services Office and meet the standard admission criteria applicable to the graduate program. Such students will be treated like new students.
Policy on Disciplinary Suspension
To be reinstated to the same program after suspension for disciplinary reasons, the student must submit completed readmission forms to the Graduate Student Services Office and meet the standard admission criteria applicable to the graduate program. Students suspended for disciplinary reasons must adhere to posted application deadlines and may not be re-admitted mid-semester.
Special Non-degree Students
Special non-degree graduate students are not subject to the B average rule.
The Graduate Application for Degree form must be filed at the beginning of the semester (see the “Calendar” for dates and deadlines) in which the student expects to complete the degree requirements. Students can also obtain a Hawaiian language version of their degree. Application forms may be obtained at the Graduate Student Services Office, and the fee paid at the Cashier’s Office or online through the student’s MyUH account.
A degree check will be made for all students who file a degree application form.
Graduate Division may delete from the graduation list the name of any student whose final grade report contains either a grade of I (incomplete) or a missing grade, or whose records have any other discrepancies.
Conferring of Degrees
Degrees are conferred and diplomas awarded three times annually, in December, May, and August. Students completing their degree requirements may, upon request, receive certification from Graduate Student Services Office that the degree will be conferred at the end of the appropriate semester. Diplomas are issued by the Office of the Registrar. Inquiries regarding diplomas should be addressed to the Office of the Registrar, Queen Lili‘uokalani Center for Student Services, Room 010, 2600 Campus Road, Honolulu, HI 96822 [tel. (808) 956-8010], and not to Graduate Student Services.
Transcripts may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar.",0.9406660795211792,10878,0.7313449382781982

"In horse racing, a wheel refers to a set of pari-mutuel betting options that involve selecting multiple horses to finish in specific positions within a race. Unlike a traditional win bet where you only pick the winning horse, a wheel bet allows you to cover various combinations of horses finishing in the top places. This type of wager provides more flexibility and can increase your chances of winning, especially in larger races with many participants. However, it also requires higher wagers and payout odds tend to be lower compared to single-horse bets.
Types of Wheels in Horse Racing
A wheel in horse racing is a type of bet that involves predicting the first three horses to cross the finish line in a race. Unlike other types of bets, such as win, place, or show, a wheel bet does not require the horses to finish in any particular order. This makes it a more challenging bet to win, but it also offers the potential for higher payouts.
The most common type of wheel bet is the straight wheel, which involves selecting three horses to win, place, and show. However, there are also several other types of wheel bets, including:
- Key wheel: This bet involves selecting one horse to win and two horses to place or show.
- Key box: This bet involves selecting one horse to win and three horses to place or show.
- Box car: This bet involves selecting three horses to place or show.
- Reverse key box: This bet involves selecting one horse to place or show and three horses to win.
The payouts for wheel bets vary depending on the type of bet and the number of horses in the race. However, the general rule is that the more horses you select, the lower the payout. The table below shows the payouts for straight wheels in a race with eight horses:
Horses Selected | Payout |
3 | $7.60 |
4 | $15.20 |
5 | $22.80 |
6 | $30.40 |
7 | $38.00 |
8 | $45.60 |
Wheel in Horse Racing
A wheel in horse racing is a cylindrical or disc-shaped object attached to a horse’s leg to provide additional traction and stability. Wheels are typically made of lightweight materials such as aluminum or composite materials and are designed to minimize interference with the horse’s natural movement.
Impact of Wheels on Race Performance
- Improved Traction: Wheels provide additional grip on slippery or uneven surfaces, allowing horses to maintain their speed and acceleration.
- Reduced Fatigue: By supporting the horse’s weight, wheels reduce the strain on their muscles and tendons, resulting in less fatigue and improved endurance.
- Safer Racing: Wheels can help prevent slips and falls, especially on wet or icy tracks.
- Enhanced Stability: Wheels provide a wider base of support, improving the horse’s balance and stability, particularly in turns.
- Controlled Pacing: Wheels can be used to regulate the horse’s speed and pace, ensuring optimal performance throughout the race.
Material | Features |
Aluminum | Lightweight, durable, and corrosion-resistant |
Composite | Extremely lightweight, flexible, and impact-resistant |
What is a Wheel in Horse Racing?
A wheel in horse racing is a small, lightweight device that is attached to the hind legs of a horse to provide additional traction on slippery or soft racing surfaces. Wheels are typically made of aluminum or plastic and are designed to roll smoothly without interfering with the horse’s stride.
Racing Surfaces Suitable for Wheels
Wheels are most commonly used on wet or muddy tracks, as they can help to prevent the horse from slipping and losing its footing. They can also be used on hard-packed surfaces, such as dirt or turf, to provide additional grip for the horse.
- Wet tracks
- Muddy tracks
- Hard-packed dirt tracks
- Turf tracks
Surface Type | Suitability for Wheels |
Wet tracks | Highly suitable |
Muddy tracks | Highly suitable |
Hard-packed dirt tracks | Somewhat suitable |
Turf tracks | Somewhat suitable |
The Evolution of Wheel Technologies in Horse Racing
Harness racing is a popular form of horse racing that involves a horse pulling a two-wheeled cart called a sulky. The wheels on a sulky are an essential part of the sport, and they have evolved significantly over the years.
The first sulkies used wooden wheels with metal rims. These wheels were heavy and slow, and they could easily get stuck in mud or snow. In the early 1900s, pneumatic tires were introduced to sulkies. These tires were much lighter and faster than wooden wheels, and they provided a more comfortable ride for the driver.
In the 1960s, aluminum wheels were introduced to sulkies. Aluminum wheels were even lighter than pneumatic tires, and they were also more durable. Today, aluminum wheels are the most common type of wheel used in sulky racing.
- Wooden wheels with metal rims
- Pneumatic tires
- Aluminum wheels
The evolution of wheel technologies in horse racing has led to faster, more comfortable, and more durable sulkies.
Wheel Type | Year Introduced | Advantages | Disadvantages |
Wooden wheels with metal rims | Early 19th century | Inexpensive, durable | Heavy, slow, can get stuck in mud or snow |
Pneumatic tires | Early 1900s | Lightweight, fast, provides a more comfortable ride | More expensive, can be punctured |
Aluminum wheels | 1960s | Lightweight, durable, fast | Most expensive |
Well, now you know! The wheel is a vital part of horse racing that can make or break a horse’s performance. Thanks for reading and be sure to drop by again for more inside scoops and insights into the fascinating world of horse racing!",0.9494789838790894,1232,2.251417875289917

As a high school graduation gift, your mom bought you an appointment to the psychic. Not a car. Not a trip. A psychic.
Eleven years later you remember only snippets of what this woman said. The session was taped precisely so you might revisit it. That was her recommendation. She advised you do this after one month, one year and ten years. You listened to it after one month and one year.
As she began recording, she closed her eyes and asked you not to speak. She commented on things that seemed irrelevant or given- noticing you breathe shallow breaths.
You’d forgotten about the cassette tape since last time you saw it, inside a green, gilded box your mother gave you. This box used to be filled with her special things: a tassel from her nursing school graduation cap, pins from the bygone feminist revolution or Carter election, and newspaper clippings. Most notable was a yellowed obituary of someone, possibly romantic. The tape was inside a manila envelope, perfectly fitted to it. You’d mimicked your mother by collecting odds and ends to fill this box. Documents like voter registration cards and the sole copy of your birth certificate, folded in half, mementos like an empty chocolate box and photographs of lost loves edited from albums for public view.
During a random conversation, you realized it had been over ten years since you reviewed that tape. It took you a while to find time to pull down the box and retrieve the cassette, and even longer to find a tape player to listen to it on. You popped it in and reflexively hit rewind. It clicked at the beginning and you pressed play. You stood alone in your apartment, and waited for the psychic’s voice pronouncing whom you were to marry. You remember she had said that you were a queen, not a princess; that you would be tempted to marry the stable boy, but should marry the king.
You waited for the tape. You heard nothing. You began to be puzzled. You flipped the tape. You rewound it in its entirety on the other side. You pressed play again, began cleaning your apartment and forgot about the tape. You were startled when it clicked, signaling the end of that side. You played the entire other side. Nothing. Maybe, now, this metaphor.
When your father called in April, you were lying in a patch of sun on the floor of the Orlando airport. You’d been waiting for several hours for a delayed plane. It was not unusual that your family members would call and introduce themselves with a “you’d better sit down for this” tone. He did. You were prepared. You were subconsciously assuming tragedy would strike at any moment. If anyone ever called twice in a row, you just knew someone was dead. ""I asked your mom for a divorce last night,” he said in his signature baby voice. He paused and waited for your reply. ""Okay, Dad,” not wanting to say the wrong thing, yet knowing this was not the right thing to say under these circumstances. He asked if you wanted to ask any questions. You said no. You told him that you were willing to listen if there was anything else he wanted to tell you. He said the type of thing that people in your family say: that he would always be your dad and that he loved you no matter what. You noticed distancing yourself entirely from the situation by the time the conversation came to a close.
Not knowing how on earth someone would respond to this correctly, you hung up with him plainly and, as usual, trying to make sure he didn’t feel uncomfortable. Your family’s typical response to this scenario would be panic: old country, grief-riddled, refusing to eat for weeks after, staring out of windows blankly, wearing black for years. Was it strange to notice yourself wondering immediately how your sister had reacted? You thought: Jesus, she’s going to lose her shit - Greek tragedy-style. She’s going to ask him if she was the first twin he had notified. She’s going to think she caused it. She’s going to try to change it. She’s going to call you.
You were shocked into a state of pure calm after hanging up. You looked at your phone like it was a small person with your head cocked. You might have muttered “huh.” Thirty-one years together, then the intercom: Groups 1 and 2 may now board. And so, you picked up a pair of complimentary headphones on your way to the jet bridge. You looked at them for any answer. You looked, puzzled, at the steward with your eyebrows arched like a rainbow, hoping maybe he’d see what a pickle this was. Pickle soup. Shit soup. You looked out the window.
Last night at yoga, the instructor, Siri, who happens to be your best friend at the moment, asked you – asked the entire class while singling you out with her eye contact – to drop your shoulders several times. She later tucked your shoulder blades under your body as you were lying on the floor when class was winding down. The music had slowed, your sweat was drying and she was directing meditation. You thought about Siri’s toothless poodle, who can’t pee without her there. You thought about Siri’s husband, who at one point wore a gas mask to sleep because he is so neurotic. You know that she obsesses about what her students think about her while she’s doing a headstand. A heart-opening exercise to beats of a pre-recorded gong. This excavated you from your judgment. You were transported to a desert via helicopter like in a PBS commercial. You saw an overlapping image of Mara, an old friend: svelte, ex-ballerina with wispy hair, and shoulders that hunched forward slightly. Siri broke the image montage to call attention to your Ujjaii breath, imploring you to exhale as if fogging a mirror. Mara’s psychologist had once noticed her convex shoulders and reassured her this is what people do when they are trying to protect their hearts.

Understanding the McKinsey Problem Solving Game (PSG) Scoring (Latest update 2023)
Have you ever wondered how the scoring system of the McKinsey PSG works and how it affects your final result?
The McKinsey Problem Solving Game (PSG) is a digital assessment that has left many candidates puzzled about its scoring mechanism. Unlike its paper-based counterpart, the McKinsey Problem-Solving Test (PST), which follows a straightforward scoring system based on the number of correct answers, the PSG scoring is more complex. It combines both the final score and the process score, making it essential for candidates to understand how it works to improve their gameplay strategy and enhance their chances of success in the case interview.

In its current format, the Imbellus presents you with a choice of 6 mini-games, out of which you play 2. The duration of the PSG ranges between 60 and 81 minutes, challenging your problem-solving abilities within a limited time frame. Since March 2023, the preferred games in the PSG have shifted to Ecosystem Building and Redrock Study, replacing the previous Ecosystem and Plant Defense games.
The instant you complete the PSG, you can make a quick estimation of your performance without waiting for the official notification. To assess your performance in the Ecosystem Building game, aim to create a sustainable solution within 30 minutes. If you can achieve this feat, you stand a decent chance of securing a good PSG score. In the Plant Defense game, surviving is the ultimate goal. Aim to last for a minimum of 15 turns in each round, ideally surpassing 25 or even 30 turns.
The PSG Scoring Breakdown
To evaluate candidates, the PSG employs both product scores, representing the final results achieved, and process scores, which assess the candidate’s approach to obtaining those results.
Product Scores: Measuring Success in Achieving Objectives
The product scores in the McKinsey PSG evaluate your level of success in achieving the objectives of the game scenarios. While there is no single correct answer, certain solutions will yield better results than others. In the first scenario, the product scores are based on the number of species that survive, considering factors such as energy consumption and provision. In the second scenario, the score is determined by the number of turns you survive until the end.
Process Scores: Evaluating Game-Playing Behavior
Process scores are derived from the analysis of your patterns and actions throughout the entire game-playing process, including keystrokes, clicks, and mouse movements. Although McKinsey has not explicitly disclosed the exact measurement method for process scores, it is crucial to assume that every action on the screen reflects your problem-solving approach. To optimize your process scores, it is essential to adopt a well-thought-out strategy from the beginning. Train yourself to approach problems analytically and systematically, allowing your actions to naturally align with desired problem-solving behaviors.
Unlocking the Secrets to Success in Every Game
The Imbellus platform presents a diverse array of games, each demanding its own unique approach and mindset. For a step-by-step guide on winning strategies, be sure to explore the McKinsey PSG Simulation.
List of current games
Embark on the Ecosystem Building game, where your task is to construct a robust food chain pyramid by thoughtfully selecting 8 species, including animals and plants. Employ these strategies to optimize your performance:
- Prioritize caloric supply and intake, ensuring optimal nourishment within the ecosystem.
- Build the food chain top-down, starting from the main predator to establish a harmonious structure.
- Respect the constraints imposed by randomly generated boundary conditions and eating rules.
- Select a location where all species can thrive and coexist.
- Identify the key influencing variables that drive the stability of the food chain.
- Strive for compatibility between the food chain and the chosen location.
In the Plant Defense game, your objective is to safeguard a vulnerable plant from invading species. Utilize these strategies to create an impenetrable defense:
- Strategically position a combination of animals and barriers to impede and decimate the attackers.
- Prevent the invaders from reaching and harming your plant.
- Ensure the survival of your plant for as many turns as possible, displaying resilience against relentless threats.
Red Rock study
Uncover the mysteries of the Red Rock Study game with these winning strategies:
- During the research stage, meticulously sift through information regarding your objective and the surrounding data.
- Save the most relevant data points and record crucial insights on paper.
- During the analysis stage, leverage your notes and utilize the in-game calculator to answer questions accurately.
- In the report stage, effectively communicate your findings by utilizing the visual tools’ interface to present compelling visualizations.
List of former games and trials
Although the following games are no longer part of the PSG, we provide insights into their strategies to ensure preparedness for any unexpected scenarios.
- Identify a subset of an animal population that is affected by a disease
- Identify the subset of an animal population affected by a disease.
- Discern patterns of disease spread based on specific characteristics observed in the animals.
- Extrapolate the disease’s progress to predict which subset of the population will be affected next.
- Recognize potential disasters by considering relevant variables.
- Effectively relocate animals to new locations that suit their needs (similar to ecosystem building).
Take charge of organizing the migration of 30 to 50 animals from one location to another within a limited timeframe of 3 to 5 turns. Ensure successful migration with these strategies:
- Document the available routes meticulously on paper or in an Excel sheet.
- Calculate the outcome variables for resources and animals for each route.
- Select the route that maximizes animal survival and meets resource requirements, preserving the delicate balance of the ecosystem.
The PSG Score: Not the Sole Determinant of Success
While the PSG score is a vital component of the screening stage, it alone cannot determine whether you pass or fail. McKinsey does not reveal your test results; instead, you receive an email notifying you if you have advanced to the consulting case interviews. No explanations, criticism, or component scores are provided, making it challenging to assess your performance.
The final decision to advance to the next rounds is based on multiple factors, including your performance in the interview screening and the Solve game, as well as the evaluation of your resume. The PSG results are taken into consideration alongside the rest of your application. McKinsey recruiters evaluate your overall profile, including your resume and cover letter, before making a decision. A high PSG score can compensate for a weaker resume, while a non-optimal PSG performance can be offset by an impressive consulting resume.
Benefits of Scoring High on the PSG Assessment
Although controversies surround the significance of the PSG score in the overall selection process, there are several reasons why a high score can be advantageous in McKinsey recruitment.
Challenging Passing Rate
McKinsey is known for its highly competitive nature, with a low passing rate for the PSG. According to various consulting preparation sites, the passing rate typically ranges from 20% to 30%. To stand out among thousands of applicants, it is crucial to aim for a score that places you in the “safe zone” and increases your chances of advancing to the next stage.
Support for Your Resume
If you come from a non-business background or your resume lacks a standout element, a good PSG score can effectively demonstrate your potential as a consultant. Achieving a high score showcases the qualities required of a McKinsey consultant, enabling hiring managers to make a more comprehensive decision and offer you an interview opportunity.
Strategies to Optimize Your PSG Scores
Practice Mental Math and Fast Reading Skills
The PSG, particularly the ecosystem-related mini-games, requires strong numerical and verbal aptitude to quickly analyze vast amounts of data. Developing mental math and fast reading skills is crucial for success not only in the PSG but also in case interviews and real consulting work. Practice exercises to improve your mental calculation speed and enhance your reading comprehension skills.
Engage in Similar Games for Practice
Candidates with experience playing video games, especially strategy games, have an advantage due to their developed “game sense.” Video games that involve data processing and system management can enhance the necessary skills for the PSG. The logic and gameplay of the McKinsey PSG share similarities with certain popular video game genres. Practicing with similar games can sharpen your problem-solving abilities and familiarize you with the strategic thinking required to excel in the PSG.
Understanding the scoring mechanism of the McKinsey Problem Solving Game is crucial for candidates aiming to succeed in the highly competitive world of McKinsey recruitment. The PSG score, comprising both product scores and process scores, plays a significant role in the screening process. While a high PSG score does not guarantee advancement, it can support your resume and showcase your potential as a consultant.
By familiarizing yourself with the PSG scoring system, optimizing your gameplay strategy, and honing your problem-solving skills, you can increase your chances of success in the McKinsey recruitment process. Embrace the challenge, decode the scoring system, and unlock your full potential in the McKinsey Problem Solving Game. Good luck on your journey to consulting excellence!

"TV in 2022 was run by liars. Traitors. Deceivers. Moles. But none of it was hosted by the inimitable Alan Cumming. That changes now.
Peacock is following the train of popularity that was BBC's The Traitors, a ""murder mystery"" reality competition TV series that will instantly make you say ""oh, so it’s like Mafia."" The set-up is simple: 20 contestants gather in a castle, completing elaborate missions to add to the prize pot that several winners will split at the end of the game. But among the players are three perfidious ""Traitors"" whose job it is to deceive their opponents, known as ""The Faithful."" Each night, the Traitors decide which player to ""murder"" — just like party games Mafia or Werewolf — and they're out of the game. Then, the Traitors need to trick their fellow players into voting out or ""banishing"" those they suspect of foul play, whether they're guilty or not.
Like Peacock's, BBC's The Traitors is set at a spectacularly Knives Out-y castle in the Scottish Highlands, filled with colossal chandeliers, unsettling taxidermy, deep Chesterfields, and yes, hidden dungeon rooms. The series' set is identical down to the giant round culty ""banishing"" table. Where the UK version featured members of the public, the U.S. is a mix of reality TV celebrities and civilians. And in place of the BBC's Claudia Winkleman running the show, Peacock's host is none other than the resplendent and theatrical Alan Cumming.
From his very first apparition as the host of The Traitors, Cumming is all in. ""I’m like a less butch Agatha Christie in a fabulous outfit,"" he says in episode 2, and wow, yes, wow. Purring promises of “murder” (not real murder, it’s a TV game) and deception as cunningly as his one-man Macbeth Broadway show, Cumming literally quotes the Scottish play as he explains the rules of the game. The series constantly has Cumming slowly, dramatically descending various grand staircases of wood and stone while providing commentary, adorned in boldly hued berets, crisply tailored tartan suits, and glittering cape pins. Gazing at a foreboding, darkened sky, Cumming ruminates on the proceedings with all the blended savvy of a Shakespearean anti-hero serving that piping hot tea. ""As Robert the Bruce famously said, 'If at first you don’t succeed, try, try to find out who’s been trash-talking you in the billiards room.'"" Randomly selecting competitors to ride a rickety old carnival wheel ride for a mission, Cumming gleefully calls to the estate's groundskeeper in an ebullient melody, ""Fergus! Grab the tombola!"" If I used ringtones after 2001, this phrase would be every received message.
The Traitors needs a consistently atmospheric, effervescent host like Cumming, as the viewer is privy to the identities of the deceivers from the word go, meaning there's no big reveal for the audience like we enjoyed in The Mole. Beyond the missions, the series spends a lot of time simply watching the competitors sitting around eating pastries and trading suspicions, which might be your thing but it feels slightly insipid at times. The stale survivor reveals, in which those who weren’t ""murdered"" by the Traitors in the night file in one-by-one to breakfast to see who snuffed it, are consistently rescued when Cumming strides in to seize the fallen competitor’s portrait off the wall, mercilessly tossing it aside. ""It’s me again! Your bed and breakfast host from hell,"" he sings in episode 1.
During the missions, Cumming’s disdain for ineptitude is glorious to behold, barking orders from behind his golden pocket watch at players, trying their best to set alight a wooden beast beside a sprawling Scottish loch. And during the nightly banishings, Cumming commands the room, delivering the fatal blow with all the finesse of a Game of Thrones villain. If Cumming ever said the words ""Shannon, you have been BANISHED,"" to me, I would perish on the spot. Dead.
The Traitors is a fun enough reality show to watch, but without the big reveal at the end, it steers into repetitive finger pointing territory that’s more interesting for the players than the audience. Luckily, they picked a killer host in Cumming, our ""bed and breakfast host from hell,"" who leans into the overtly silly Poirot party vibe with every last lauded acting skill he has. It’s rare the host upstages the players, but in this case, it’s the perfect crime.",0.958227276802063,1028,1.1358387470245361

"Primary design goal here was to provide a heavy LRM capability but still retain decent mobility and medium range direct fire capability and I think this variant does a pretty good job in that regard. Upside: - LRM40+Artemis & TAG for excellent back-line support potential. ECM mechs in your line of sight from 750m in are officially on the menu. - Can throw a fairly heavy 28 pt energy punch from 270m in at a very economical heat cost. - 36% cooling eff with the 16 doubles which will allow you to drop multiple 72 pt alphas from 180-270m. LL/ML combo can reach out and touch people from 540m in / LL's out to 900m. It is absolutely no problem to crank off the 20's and then unload the 2LL+2ML into someone as the LRM's are headed in. On cooler maps especially, you are looking at 2-3 alphas easy. Good times!... - XL300 will get you 62.9 kph tweaked, which makes the old girl feel pretty nimble for being 85 tons. Throw it into reverse and circle when the lights come calling and you will be able to keep them in front. The lasers alone can fire for a loooooong time - so anything small and fast that wants to hang around better have some good leg armor... - 480 pts of armor with 16 on your backplates gets you 56 pt side torsos and a 92 pt center. Arms stay maxed @ 56 pts also. Downside: - XL Engine - No BAP - No AMS - 10-tube arms on the 5M mean you are throwing 2 salvos instead of one big one. Obviously this is not optimal, but there is no way to drop 40 on someone in a single shot with a 5M. The torso tubes are 3x6's so the best you're gonna do in one salvo is 35. (2xLRM10/3xLRM5). - A somewhat sub-standard LRM load of 900 rounds - this = 22.5 shots, so making sure that the locks you have will stick is a major priority. Nothing worse here than cranking off 40 LRMs into a hill side because your lock dropped as you fired... :angry: - Maybe a little light in the legs? I can see where 360 LRM's sitting under 49 pts of armor might make some people nervous... - Zero torso weapons. Lose an arm and 1/2 your firepower is now laying in the dirt... Summary: As LRM supports go, I feel like this is a pretty nice package. It can get you where you want to go at a decent clip, can make it rain with the best of them and can quite seriously punch someone in the face if they think staying inside of 180 is a good idea. Here are some results I've had lately: ...and my groupings: As with any LRM support build, you are still highly dependent on your team (for locks and protection vs. light and brawler swarms) and you really need to get a feel for positioning and the timing/judgement of when to unload and when to lay low. Missile boats are primary targets once they reveal themselves and you WILL be hunted once you start doing damage. So just be aware that there is a definite learning curve here, even with all the firepower that this thing can throw downrange. Urban maps especially can be a serious challenge to do well in because of all the available cover. Once you get those nuances down though, this is a fun mech to play for sure and can definitely rack up some big scores when everything comes together. Good Hunting and as always, Thanks for reading!",0.9515833258628845,756,0.850448489189148

"Naltrexone injection may cause liver damage when given in large doses. It is not likely that naltrexone injection will cause liver damage when given in recommended doses. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had hepatitis or another liver disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: excessive tiredness, unusual bleeding or bruising, pain in the upper right part of your stomach that lasts more than a few days, light-colored bowel movements, dark urine, or yellowing of the skin or eyes. Your doctor will probably not give you naltrexone injection if you have liver disease or if you develop symptoms of liver disease during your treatment.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving naltrexone injection.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with naltrexone injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website http://www.vivitrol.com to obtain the Medication Guide.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Naltrexone injection is used along with counseling and social support to help people who have stopped drinking large amounts of alcohol to avoid drinking again. Naltrexone injection is also used along with counseling and social support to help people who have stopped abusing opiate medications or street drugs to avoid abusing the medications or street drugs again. Naltrexone injection should not be used to treat people who are still drinking alcohol, people who are still using opiates or street drugs, or people who have used opiates within the past 10 days. Naltrexone is in a class of medications called opiate antagonists. It works by blocking activity in the limbic system, a part of the brain that is involved in alcohol and opiate dependence.
How should this medicine be used?
Naltrexone injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be given by injection into the muscle of the buttocks by a healthcare provider once every 4 weeks.
Naltrexone injection will not prevent withdrawal symptoms that may occur when you stop drinking alcohol after drinking large amounts for a long time or when you stop using opiate medications or street drugs.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before receiving naltrexone injection,
- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to naltrexone, any other medications, carboxymethylcellulose (an ingredient in artificial tears and some medications), or polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG; an ingredient in some injected medications). Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't know if a medication you are allergic to contains carboxymethylcellulose or PLG.
- tell your doctor if you have taken any opiate medications including certain medications for diarrhea, cough, or pain; methadone (Dolophine); or buprenorphine (Buprenex, Subutex, in Suboxone) within the last 7 to 10 days. Ask your doctor if you are not sure if a medication you have taken is an opiate Also tell your doctor if you have used any opiate street drugs such as heroin within the last 7 to 10 days. Your doctor may order certain tests to see if you have recently taken any opiate medications or used street drugs. Your doctor will not give you naltrexone injection if you have recently taken an opiate medication or used street drug.
- do not take any opiate medications or use street drugs during your treatment with naltrexone injection. Naltrexone injection blocks the effects of opiate medications and street drugs. You may not feel the effects of these substances if you take or use them at low or normal doses at most times during your treatment. However, you may be more sensitive to the effects of these substances when it is almost time for you to receive a dose of naltrexone injection or if you miss a dose of naltrexone injection. You may experience an overdose if you take normal doses of opiate medications at these times, or if you take high doses of opiate medications or use street drugs at any time during your treatment with naltrexone. An opiate overdose may cause serious injury, coma (long-lasting unconscious state), or death. If you take or use opiate medications or street drugs during your treatment and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor or seek emergency medical care immediately: difficulty breathing, slow, shallow breathing, faintness, dizziness, or confusion. Be sure that your family knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.
- you should know that you may be more sensitive to the effects of opiate medications or street drugs after you finish your treatment with naltrexone injection. After you finish your treatment, tell any doctor who may prescribe medication for you that you were previously treated with naltrexone injection.
- some medications should not be taken with naltrexone injection. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with naltrexone injection. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting naltrexone injection with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking naltrexone injection, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.
- tell your doctor if you have stopped taking opiates or using street drugs and are experiencing withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, sleeplessness, yawning, fever, sweating, teary eyes, runny nose, goose bumps, shakiness, hot or cold flushes, muscle aches, muscle twitches, restlessness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, or stomach cramps, and if you have or have ever had bleeding problems such as hemophilia (a bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot normally), a low number of platelets in your blood, depression, or kidney disease.
- tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while receiving naltrexone injection, call your doctor.
- if you need medical treatment or surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are receiving naltrexone injection. Wear or carry medical identification so that healthcare providers who treat you in an emergency will know that you are receiving naltrexone injection.
- you should know that naltrexone injection may make you feel dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery or do other dangerous activities until you know how this medication affects you.
- you should know that people who drink large amounts of alcohol or who use street drugs often become depressed and sometimes try to harm or kill themselves. Receiving naltrexone injection does not decrease the risk that you will try to harm yourself. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience symptoms such as feelings of sadness, anxiousness, worthlessness, or helplessness, or thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor right away if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.
- you should know that naltrexone injection is only helpful when it is used as part of an addiction treatment program. It is important that you attend all counseling sessions, support group meetings, education programs or other treatments recommended by your doctor.
- talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of naltrexone injection before you receive your first dose. Naltrexone will remain in your body for about 1 month after you receive the injection and cannot be removed before this time.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?

"Excess fat can inevitably accumulate and store underneath the chin mainly due to weight gain, the process of aging or even genetics. When the fat forms an extra layer beneath the chin, it is called a “double chin.” A double chin gives you an unattractive facial profile, makes you appear older and even makes you feel self-conscious about your appearance. Excess layers of fat under the chin do not go away with diet and exercise. But thanks to Kybella, you can remove that double chin and restore your natural facial features.
Removing a double chin using Kybella in Chicago is a non-surgical facial contouring technique that has proven to be safe and effective. So, there is no need to undergo liposuction or other invasive surgical procedures in order to get back the natural appearance of your face.
Where to Get a Kybella Treatment in Chicago
Treatment using Kybella in Chicago is safely performed by a trained specialist at Rejuvenate Med Spa in Oak Brook, Illinois. There is minimal to no downtime with Kybella compared to similar procedures elsewhere that promise to improve the appearance of a double chin.
Why Should I Choose Kybella in Chicago?
Kybella in Chicago is done using a special substance called deoxycholic acid. This identical substance is naturally produced in the body and helps to emulsify and absorb fat. When injected, it disables the fatty cells under the chin and stops them from further collecting and storing fat.
Once you visit Rejuvenate Med Spa, a specialist will assess you to determine if treatment with Kybella is suitable for you. Several injections of deoxycholic acid may be needed, depending on your desired facial profile and the amount of fat to be extracted.
Destroying the fatty cells beneath your chin will dramatically reduce the appearance of the double chin and allow for your natural chin to be contoured to your satisfaction. Clients are usually happy with their before and after facial profile, which also shows an enhanced jawline.
Getting the facial profile that makes you look your best is made easy with Kybella at Rejuvenate Med Spa in Oak Brook. Check out our Rejuvenate Med Spa Reviews page and contact us today to schedule a consultation and learn more!",0.9262898564338684,464,0.8090351819992065

"Here is our latest Blog post for Osteopath Dr Lauren Wilson
First off what is a habit? It is a settled or regular tendency or practice. But this takes time and effort. Don’t be fooled that after two workouts the next two will be easy but they will be easier with these tips.
Tip 1: Set A Date and Time
Write it down in your calendar and stick to it. Work things around your exercise to make it a priority. Sometimes it’s just scheduling it in the diary is all it takes.
Tip 2: Prepare
If scheduling a workout in the morning, get your clothes and runners out and ready the night before. It will make the process easier in the morning and will help motivate you to get out of bed when you have gone to the effort the night before.
Tip 3: Start Small
Starting small is key with creating a good habit. Why? Because having a goal too big or out of reach without a plan to progress may lead to disappointment and therefore giving up.
Try starting small with just getting up 30 mins early to go for a walk. Once tackling that move to something more like a run or something in the afternoons a week.
Tip 4: Have Fun
Meet up with a friend, listen to a good playlist or podcast or just try something new if what you are doing isn’t for you. Exercise does not always need to be a structured HIIT workout maybe it is a 30 min dance around the house or some Zumba on youtube. Find what works for you and have fun! At the end of the day that is going to keep you more motivated and create good habits.
Tip 5: Consistency Vs Frequency
Quality over quantity. We have all heard it and it related to exercise habits too. Set realistic goals and do them well rather than doing one really good workout and slacking off for the rest of the week.
Final Tip: Look after your body. With these tips, your body will adjust and condition to what you are doing a lot better rather than rushing out to run a half marathon with a week or running under your belt. Stretch, rest and recover. If you do find yourself with some more aches or pains please contact us at the clinic and we would love to help you create good healthy habits.

"Vladimir Karaleev is a Bulgarian born fashion designer who moved to Berlin to study fashion design at 19. As a teenager, he reacted against Sofia’s sartorial conservatism by making clothes for himself and his friends for techno parties. When deciding where to go for University, Berlin was a natural choice – he already spoke German, and Berlin in the early 2000’s was on the cusp of something new. Since then he has created collections that are at once elegant and disheveled. He pokes fun at fashion by combining fabrics like neoprene and organza, yet manages to leave everything beautiful and understated. I got to hang out with the funny, chilled-out and immensely talented designer at his studio near Lausitzer Platz, in the heart of Kreuzberg, to talk about his love for travel, why he loves Berlin, and his most recent collection.
You moved to Berlin at 19 to study fashion. What provoked that decision? Tell me about the lead up to that?
First of all, I was in a German school in Bulgaria where I’m from, I knew the language - so it was a really easy opportunity for me to come to Berlin. The education I could get in Bulgaria in the creative field would not have been as good at the time. Berlin, even back then [in the early 2000’s] had so many fashion schools, it was the obvious choice. The second reason was that my friends and myself were really into the techno rave scene from the 90s - so Berlin was the place to be.
Do you think Berlin is still that raw place for new designers to come to?Would you say it has maintained the energy that it had when you came here?
It’s a totally different energy now, but it’s still a very good place to work. I go to Paris and to New York obviously to sell my collections, but it’s very nice to be based somewhere like Berlin. To have a nice studio and apartment – it’s not totally unrealizable, you know. If you move somewhere else it would be harder. Your lifestyle would change. A lot of people move here, and if it doesn’t work out, it doesn't seem like such a huge loss. You can just be here and enjoy your time.
Do you remember what your 19 year old self wanted to be? How does one decide to be a fashion designer?
I was making clothes since I was in school. We didn’t have a lot of choices in Bulgaria at the time. Everything was open but it was too expensive for us to buy designer clothing. I knew fashion from magazines and TV, obviously. When we traveled outside Bulgaria, I always bought so many things. Then I started to make stuff for myself, and for my friends. We went to a lot of parties - and that was a way to express myself. It was difficult. In Bulgaria it’s still very conservative, so it was easy to shock people. If you wore some kind of crazy animal print, people would say, “Oh my God, that's insane!” So that was fun, and it was exactly the time when you wanted to be different – I was 16. In Berlin, different was normal, and when I started to study here I felt like this is where I could be myself.
Looking at your clothes, there’s obviously a huge process behind them, and clearly an intellectual one as well – the geometry you reference in your work, for example...
Yes, we did do very geometrical shapes [this latest collection]. It’s kind of a new thing, in a way, for me. My previous collection had a lot of folds and drapes. I started out like that. I love working on a mannequin and before we started this collection I was working, and trying things out. I was thinking, for this collection, I want the folds to have some kind of volume, like the shapes. For the patterns, we thought about 90’s surf prints, with lines and squares - which is another reference to the 1920’s formalism of Kazimir Malevich. I also drew from the constructivist movement from the 20th century. Creating clothing is like creating compositions. It’s proportion, color and shapes.
There's a collision in the fabrics you select as well. You have neoprene, organza…?
This was very interesting when I started. I made a project of clothing only made of jersey. It was at a time when jersey was only really used for casual wear, and you could really only buy a t-shirt in jersey. Then everybody started to work more with jersey and draping because it’s stretchy it always fits the body. It was at a time when I wanted to explore things like that. I was always interested in deconstruction, so actually in school a lot of my projects were about destroying old clothing and making new. I remember I used to buy sports jerseys upside down, and make everything distorted. Now I’m very interested in different structures with different fabrics – neoprene is a very technical outdoor fabric. You can combine these fabrics with expensive organza, which is fancy and lady-like. It’s fun to make things clash.
Your clothes appear to be almost contradictory in that sense. There’s luxury and elegance, and then a sort of disheveled aspect.
I don’t want the clothes to be taken too seriously. Everything is a bit strange when you look at it twice. It’s not like a mainstream product, it’s like a niche, but there are tons of people looking for something special but they don’t want to scare everybody. We always try to hug everyone with one collection. From my experience, my clients always want something special, but not something that will scream at you, you know. I am always surprised to see different people in my designs. Each person has his or her own interpretation of the clothes. One dress can have so many meanings - it depends on the context. What I’ve realized is that a lot of people don’t want to show off so much, they want to wear clothes for themselves. They don’t buy clothes because of the brand. They buy my designs because they like it, and want to own it, and I like that idea.",0.9852411150932312,1335,1.0085818767547607
"Change the Future of Money and Economy
With the advance of digitalization, we are able to recognize values unseen to the human eye such as time and space as data, and the birth of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain are already beginning to change the nature of economy as we know it today. Our mission is to make full use of these growing technologies to unearth the most effective uses of their value and create a brand new economy.
Unleash The World
Our goal is to create a society in which everyone in the world is freed from any number of constraints through the power of technology, and can freely create their own future. While the concept of ""wealth"" is becoming increasingly diverse, we believe that through pursuing a way of life as an individual a new sense of values will be fostered that, in turn, will lead to the sustainable development of society.
Metaps People Quality
What is the stance that each and every Metaps employee takes toward their work to ""change the future of money and economy""?
What actions do we focus on in our day-to-day tasks that help us to ""unleash the world""?
MPQ (Metaps People Quality) is a collection of the five most important values and behaviors that employees incorporate into their work.
Focus on results with a sense of passion and simple honesty
Above all, we value passion. We believe that even above an individual's skills and abilities, passion makes the largest difference. Without passion, others cannot be inspired or get involved. Passion is the true source of power to perform tasks to the best of one's abilities, and, regardless of outward appearances, we will continue to call upon our passion while striving to achieve our goals.
Think ""how to do it"" instead of why you can't
No matter what you do, you will encounter obstacles. It is precisely because no one may have ever done it before that this obstacle appears impossible to overcome. At times like this, we don't become intimidated by this obstacle's size, but instead choose to break it down by thinking outside the box and performing a steady course of repeated trial and error.
Move at quadruple speed to stay ahead of challenges
It's due to questioning common sense and pursuing ideals that innovative ideas are born. However, behind every innovative idea stands a number of people across the world with the power to unlock it and make it a reality themselves. We believe that the most important part of any new idea is to execute it and give it form with speed and vigor in order to always stay four steps ahead.
Never be satisfied with the status quo and always aim to reach higher
Past results and methodologies obtained through trial and error are often strongly remembered as success stories. However, it's important to be prepared to face and sometimes discard these preconceptions. While we believe that it is important not to take past successes and precedents for granted, it is equally important to focus on what the best thing to do for the current situation may be, and never stop the process of adapting and changing.
Create new values through the involvement of many people
Each and every one of us should be a professional, however, there is a limit as to what we can achieve as individuals working alone. Instead, we believe that a collaborative group of strong individuals working together creates a multiplier effect, leading to the achievement of maximum results through the power of co-creation.",0.9571647047996521,693,1.8857066631317139
"Laura Bassi was a pioneering Italian physicist and academic in the 18th century, who was one of the first woman in the world to reach a series of milestones in science and education.
Born in Bologna in 1711, Bassi was privately tutored during her childhood, receiving an education in the sciences and mathematics.
She attended the University of Bologna where she was awarded a doctorate degree in 1732. She was the first woman in the world to receive a doctorate in science, and only the second woman to receive a philosophy doctorate (the first being Elena Cornaro Piscopia).
She then began working at the University of Bologna, making her the first salaried female teacher in the university and in the world.
However, as a woman, she was more restricted in delivering public lectures than her male colleagues, as the univerisity believed that women should live private lives. Throughout her time working at the University of Bologna, she campaigned to be treated as an equal to the university's male lecturers, but to no avail.
Bassi's work had a profound impact on the field of physics, influencing the work of many of her contemporaries and future scientists. Her research paved the way for further discoveries in the field and helped to establish it as a separate discipline. She authored around 28 different papers, the majority of which were on physics and hydraulics.
Bassi was a strong advocate for the education of women and worked to increase their access to higher education in the sciences. As the first woman in her field, she became well-known and was popularly depicted as a 'Bolognese Minerva', the Roman goddess of wisdom and arts.
Later in her career, in the 1750s, she was granted permission to start private lessons and was given funding to do experiments from her home. This allowed her to avoid the restrictions placed by the university regulations. At the same time, she was among the highest paid employee of the university.
By the end of her life, she was also a Professor in two other institutions - the Collegio Montalto and the Academy of the Institute for Sciences in Bologna.
Bassi died in 1778, aged 66. She is remembered today as a pioneering figure in physics and a trailblazer for women in the sciences.",0.9876713156700134,478,3.4506213665008545
"Its time to take some risks and up your style game. A shearling jacket can be as warm as a puffer coat and, if you wear it right, as badass as the perfect leather jacket. Think of Robert Redford in Downhill Racer in the ’70s, or Bane setting off mayhem on the streets of Gotham in The Dark Night Rises. But if you’re not careful, you could end up looking more like an extra in an episode of Fargo. Follow these four steps to nail the right look.

Wear Real Shearling
Make sure your jacket is 100 percent real shearling—that is, sheepskin or lambskin with the short under-layer of wool still attached. Fake shearling is not as breathable, says Men’s Health Fashion Editor Dan Michel, and it looks and feels cheap. Good shearling jackets start at R3000, while premium ones will cost you upwards of 7,000. It’s steep, but it’s an investment you’ll carry with you for a lifetime. To find a jacket on the lower end of that range (without resorting to a knock-off), look for a jacket with just a shearling collar. Go ahead and turn up your collar to block wind, too. “It’s one of the rare occasions when popping your colour is actually OK,” Michel says.
Try an Unexpected Color
A classic shearling, like the one worn above by fashion blogger Isaac Hindin-Miller, will never go out of style. If you’re not into the western look, though, that’s OK. You can opt for shearling dyed in a dark hue like black, charcoal gray, or navy.
Related: 5 Small Details That Wreck Your Look
What to Wear With Your Shearling Jacket
The presence of a shearling jacket automatically elevates your entire outfit, Michel says. Just take a look at UFC fighter and Men’s Health cover guy Conor McGregor, above. “What you pair under it can be a little bit more casual,” says Michel. We’d go for a high-quality T-shirt or a thin turtleneck against the high collar. Jewel tones—burgundy is a fail-proof option—look rich against shearling. That applies to layering pieces, pants, and even shoes. Just avoid pairing brown boots (or, worse, a brown hat) with a brown shearling jacket—unless, of course, you’re an actual cowboy. Don’t shy away from incorporating a shearling coat into dressier looks. A sharp pair of black monk straps would look outstanding with any shearling jacket.
How to Take Care Of Your Shearling Jacket
A shearling coat will last for decades and, if maintained, will look better with every wear. Before ever stepping out in your shearling jacket, make sure to treat it with a water-repellant spray. If it does get wet, let it air-dry—high heat will destroy the fur—and then brush out any water spots with a soft-bristle brush.",0.9151613116264343,659,1.0033643245697021

"The words Amanda heard were very simple to comprehend. She was four months pregnant. It was a fact that should have made her happy, nervous, perhaps even outraged, but it merely left her numb. After the doctor’s initial announcement, Amanda saw his mouth move, but heard no sound. She also saw her family’s shocked expressions, but couldn’t look into their eyes because it took all the strength Amanda had to concentrate on processing this incomprehensible information. There was absolutely no way that she could be four months pregnant, Amanda wanted to scream, but unfortunately she couldn’t tell her family, especially her sister Edwina, the reason for her certainty: the only man she had sex with was Joe and that was only a week ago. When the numbness subsided, all Amanda could do was laugh.
“That’s absurd,” Amanda heard herself reply. “That’s absolutely impossible.”
“Obviously not,” Edwina said, immediately putting an end to Amanda’s laughter.
“I’m sorry Amanda,” Dr. Saxon said. “I ran the test twice to make sure the fetus wasn’t harmed by your . . . accident. You are pregnant.”
“Jeffrey, are you quite certain it’s four months?” Madeline asked.
“It’s always hard to pinpoint the date, Madeline,” the doctor replied. “But yes I would say Amanda’s in her second trimester.”
While her mother and her doctor conversed and Edwina tried not to convulse, Amanda felt as if the room was spinning and reached out to grab Joe’s hand for support. A part of her subconscious realized this was an inappropriate action while in Edwina’s presence, but the other part of her psyche that was unconcerned about protocol was stronger. Luckily, even though Madeline was speaking with Jeffrey, she was watching her daughter as if she was under a microscope and grabbed Amanda’s hand before it clutched Joe’s arm.
“Jeffrey can we take her home now?” Madeline asked.
“Yes,” he said. “As far as I can see mother and child are doing fine.”
“I wish you would stop saying that,” Amanda said, suddenly frightened. “You’ve made a mistake.”
“Perhaps not,” Joe added quietly.
Although the steps to Nightwind were many and steep, Adam’s preternatural agility allowed him to glide over them in seconds while cradling Winter in his arms and pondering who Joey was. In the entranceway of this magnificent home, Adam bristled when he thought of how weak and insignificant the quarters in which he and his father now lived looked in comparison though he wasn’t sure why. He and Vincent lived well. In fact, throughout his entire life he had never wanted for anything thanks to his father. Yet from the moment his foot touched the steps of Nightwind he had the irrational feeling that all this should be his. He tried not to dwell on that thought, but only deal with the matter at hand: getting Winter back into bed.
He saw red velvet chairs lining the hallway, embroidered damask curtains to his left, and a white marble staircase in front of him and while these material items were all foreign to him he couldn’t escape the feeling of familiarity that enveloped him.
He wasn’t halfway up the stairway when he heard the sound of a young boy’s laughter and stopped abruptly. He turned every which way but saw no one and surmised that the sound was echoing in his own mind. Unable to smell a human scent, he was sure that no one was home, but he didn’t want to be caught by the family when they returned, so he pushed the boy’s laughter from his mind and invaded Winter’s mind to find out where her bedroom was, but he couldn’t penetrate her unconsciousness. He thought it very strange that he couldn’t penetrate her mentally, he thought the only people you couldn’t pierce were family members and those who gave you the gift of the Golden Life. But he was sure there was some logical reason that his father would be able to explain.
He was forced to go room to room until he found what he presumed to be Winter’s bedroom, which naturally was on the top floor. As he gently put Winter in her bed and drew her comforter around her, his eyes met those of a young boy in a photograph on Winter’s night table. The boy couldn’t be more than four-years-old and his smile was so joyful it radiated his entire face with the innocence only a young child could know. Adam wondered how long it was before this child was forced to understand horror.
With one last look at Winter, who seemed to be in the middle of a soothing dream, Adam began to leave but when he passed by the open window he was drawn to the moon’s glow. It was a full moon and it was hanging majestically in the sky. Adam thought it looked like a tunnel that he could fly right through on his way to heaven. He was suddenly filled with such purity that it brought tears to his still-crimson eyes and he remembered, fleetingly, the gentle touch of a woman’s hand. The memory was ripped away when he heard Winter’s piercing voice.
“Who are you?”
Amanda stared into the hopeful eyes of her lover and wondered if she could possibly be carrying his child. Just the thought of it made her heart pulsate with a feeling of overwhelming bliss. But the feeling quickly vanished when she realized it simply couldn’t be true and that tomorrow Dr. Saxon would announce he did indeed make a
mistake. But for this moment she allowed herself to wonder if she could ever again be as happy as she was when she was carrying his children.
Finally, Madeline put herself between Joe and Amanda’s stare and advised Joe to take his wife and daughter home. Joe hated to abandon Amanda especially when it was obvious that she needed him, but his wife and daughter were close by and they needed him as well. He glanced at Edwina whose face was a blank mask behind which lay an anger that would soon be unleashed, and at his daughter who was quite calm despite all the emotional adults around her and was helping Anthony stand.
“Anthony are you alright?” asked Madeline.
“Yes,” he said. “Now I am.”
“Was it another blackout son?” Perry inquired.
“Yes,” Anthony said. “There’s been another murder.”
“What else Uncle Anthony?” Jonatha asked. “Something’s different, I could feel how frightened you were.”
“This time I was able to see the victim’s face,” Anthony said.
“Oh dear God,” Madeline cried.
“Who did you see?” Joe asked.
“It was a policeman,” Anthony said. “David Anderson.”
“No!” Joe cried.
“I’m sorry, Joe,” Anthony said. “He fought back, but it was no use. It was almost as if this killer had superhuman strength.”
“Was it at Serenity Pond?” Joe asked. “That’s where I left him.”
“Yes,” Anthony confirmed.
“I have to go,” he declared.
“I’ll go with you,” Anthony said. “I’d like to perform the last rites.”
“Thank you,” Joe said.
“Anthony,” Madeline asked. “Why did you look so peaceful this time? You didn’t seem to be in any pain.”
“I wasn’t,” he replied. “I was in Jonatha’s care.”
Upon hearing this Edwina shifted her focus from her husband to her Daughter.
“You’re just putting out fires left and right aren’t you honey?” Edwina asked Jonatha.
“I don’t deserve credit for whatever it is I’m doing,” she replied. “I’m not responsible.”
“Jonatha please, you know I don’t have the capacity to dissect metaphysical mutterings,” Edwina said. “I couldn’t master fractions for God’s sake.”
“Soon you’ll understand,” Jonatha responded cryptically. “Soon you all will.”
The young girl’s statement created a silence among the family, a silence filled with curiosity, befuddlement, disdain, and fear. A silence that Anthony felt he needed to respond to.
“Edwina,” he said. “Don’t trivialize what you don’t understand.”
“I’ll do whatever I want,” Edwina began, the continued with mock indignation, “I was in a horrible car accident. How quickly one incident overshadows another.”
“If you’d like I’ll switch places with you,” Amanda said unable to listen to her sister’s tirade any longer.
“Why not?” Edwina said. “It sounds like you’re having more sex than me anyway.”
“Edwina!” Perry cried. “We’re all very tired and I think it’s time we left. Jonatha I’ll take you and your mother home.”
“I’d rather go with . . . my husband,” Edwina said. “But obviously he’s needed elsewhere.”
“I’m sorry,” Joe said.
“That’s alright,” Edwina demurred. “It’ll give me a chance to speak with Amanda in private.”
Joe was too shocked to respond to Edwina’s comment or contemplate its hidden meaning and he ran out of the emergency room without noticing Vincent waiting near the bushes.
“I trust everyone has recovered?” Vincent asked.
The airplane landed smoothly on the runway, but Dashiell’s stomach still felt uneasy. He had originally planned to come to Nightfall, uncover Jonatha Lassiter’s secret, and use it to destroy his mother, Ondine. It was a simple plan and one that he knew he could accomplish with Llewellyn’s help. But when Ondine announced that she would be their travel companion, the plan suddenly became more complicated.
For as long as Dashiell could remember his mother tried to control his life. And even though Dashiell grew to love the extravagant results of her machinations, he resented her interference. Ondine handpicked Llewellyn to be her son’s companion and Dashiell had grown to love him and cherish their relationship. It was also Ondine who introduced Dashiell to the Golden Life and all the magic and power it held, without her he would not be on his way to crossing over and becoming a vampire for all eternity. Still, she was his mother and an extremely domineering one. He wanted her out of his life for good, but until then he would have to listen to her every command.
“Boys grab my bags,” Ondine barked, as one of the flight crew helped her on with her mink coat. “And be careful of my crocodile tote, it has my make-up, and you do want your mother to look beautiful don’t you?”
Not waiting for or expecting a response, Ondine made her exit from the plane leaving Dashiell and Llewellyn to share in the carrying of her bags. As they left the plane they avoided looking into the eyes of the crew members, who regularly cast pitying glances at both men, who had to succumb to Ondine’s wishes without the benefit of a weekly paycheck.
“You realize this will be the worst trip we’ve ever taken,” Llewellyn said.
“If everything goes as I’ve planned,” Dashiell replied. “It’ll be the worst trip my mother has ever taken as well.”
Perplexed, but beaming with pride, Llewellyn followed his lover off the plane.
The Long Road Home
For the first time in quite a while the Love’s limousine was filled to capacity. Vincent sat awkwardly between Perry and Madeline in the seats behind Bartholomew and faced Amanda, Edwina, and Jonatha. Madeline had tried to navigate her granddaughter into the seat between her daughters, but Jonatha had meandered, uncharacteristically, and was the last to enter. Her tardiness, however, allowed her to have a window seat. The young girl
had barely spoken a word since bringing Edwina to the hospital and Madeline wondered if she was hiding something. Amanda stared at Vincent and silently remarked that he was not only very tall, but very odd looking. She couldn’t quite put her finger on it, but he looked slightly out of proportion.
For the moment, Madeline preoccupied herself with the emotional lives of her daughters. A long time ago she had a made a choice to support Amanda and was therefore not constrained to the usual guilt a mother faces when siding with one child during times of conflict. She firmly believed that Edwina seduced Joe when he was losing a battle against grief after his son’s kidnapping. She also believed Edwina committed this seduction not out of love, but jealousy and spite. It was an act for which she would never be able to forgive Edwina fully.
So consumed was Madeline with watching for the inevitable sparks that would fly between her daughters that she didn’t notice how uncomfortable Perry had grown since they had gotten into the limousine. She would never guess that it was because he was sitting next to the man (who wasn’t really a man) who, was a threatening force. It may have gone unnoticed to Madeline, but not Edwina, who had decided to ignore Amanda for the time being and shower Vincent with attention.
“So Vincent,” said Edwina.
“Yes Mrs. Lassiter,” Vincent replied
“First of all thank you for saving my sister from heaven knows what fate and for entering our lives so dramatically,” Edwina continued. “I was beginning to think you would never show your face and hide in those dreary servants quarters forever.”
Vincent didn’t reply, but only stared at Edwina. In the blackness that made up her eyes, Vincent saw a kindred spirit, a woman who moved forward without ever glancing back. Edwina, he realized, was no Lot’s wife.
“Perry, in all the time I’ve known you, you never mentioned you had such a charming daughter,” Vincent remarked.
Everyone in the limousine, even Amanda and Jonatha who were trying desperately to escape any conversation, was intrigued by this comment. None of them suspected Perry and Vincent of knowing each other before Vincent and his son came to live on Love property. As if on cue, all four women bombarded Perry with questions at the same time.
“Daddy,” Edwina said, “I thought you just met Vincent?”
“Dad,” Amanda added, “Why didn’t you tell us?”
“Grandpa?” Jonatha asked, “Do you also know Adam?”
“Perry,” Madeline said, “Do you and Mr. Savage have a relationship that I’m not aware of?”
Vincent smiled an inhuman smile and slowly turned to Perry, whose face was as white as Eucharist, pausing before he spoke.
“Shall you explain it to them, Perry or shall I?”
When Adam turned to face Winter, the first thing she noticed were his crimson-colored eyes and she had the vague memory of seeing the same eyes once before, but she couldn’t recall when. Looking at the rest of his tall, muscular body she slowly became frightened
by the reality that this intruder appeared to be much stronger than she was and could be violent.
“I said who are you?” Winter asked again less harshly than before.
“My name is Adam Savage. I’m your neighbor.”
Winter knew the name, but having never seen the face, she wasn’t entirely convinced.
“What are you doing here?”
“I found you in the woods, asleep or unconscious, and I decided not to let you die so I brought you here. And you’re welcome.”
“How do I know you’re telling the truth?”
“I don’t care if you believe me or not, that’s what happened.”
“If you knew who I was you wouldn’t be talking to me with that attitude.”
“I know exactly who you are. You’re Winter Lassiter, Perry Love’s granddaughter and Jonatha’s step-sister or cousin depending on which side you look at it. And let me tell you, she’s a lot nicer than you are.”
“Oh please! Jonatha is so boring! You would think she’s cool.”
” Obviously you’re jealous of your own flesh and blood,” replied Adam, surprised by his desire to defend Jonatha’s name.
“Jealous? Like not much. I think you better get out of here right now before I scream for my mother.”
“Go right ahead, there’s nobody home.”
For the next ten minutes Winter and Adam continued to banter as if they’d known each other their entire lives. Winter accused Adam of being a blind jerk for liking Jonatha, and Adam accused Winter of being a spoiled rich girl. Adam was highly annoyed by this encounter, but also felt that it was natural and was amused by the spontaneity of their repartee. Winter just wanted him to leave.
Adam turned to go, but once again his eyes glanced on the photograph of the young boy.
“Who’s that?” he asked.
“Oh I thought you knew everything about me. That’s my brother, he was kidnapped when he was four and I haven’t seen him since,” Winter said. “And I don’t care if I ever do.”
“He probably can’t wait to see you again,” Adam said just before he left Winter’s room.
The Long Road Home
“We are waiting for some kind of explanation,” Edwina said and for once her sister, mother, and daughter all agreed with her.
“Mr. Savage and I are business associates,” Perry said trying desperately to ignore the small beads of sweat that began to form on his forehead.
“Vincent didn’t I hear that you’re a professor of ancient civilizations?” Amanda asked.
“That’s correct,” Vincent replied.
“Then how in the world could you be in business with my Father?” Amanda said. “Love Industries is in the pharmaceutical business.”
“Perry may I continue?” Vincent asked.
The last thing in the world Perry Love wanted to do was give this creature free reign to converse with his family, but he was at a loss for words and, as usual, he overestimated his ability to control a situation so he agreed.
“Thank you,” Vincent said. “I am an expert on ancient civilizations and that includes their scientific and medicinal cures. Many of these cures, especially those of the early Egyptian times, are applicable to today’s diseases primarily the blood disorders that Love Industries is working so hard to combat. Your father and I were introduced to each other by a colleague years ago and realized my expertise could help Perry uncover little known herbs and roots that could be used to forward modern medicine.”
“So you must be familiar with the laboratory in Stockholm?” Madeline asked.
“You must be referring to the one in Oslo?” Vincent countered.
Madeline smiled begrudgingly, then added: “Just testing you.”
“What a sad fate has befallen you Perry,” Vincent declared. “The women in your life may be charming, but it seems they’re also quite suspicious.”
To Dashiell and Llewellyn the Collins Inn was charming and rustic and exactly what they thought of when they imagined a New England bed and breakfast. Ondine shuddered when she remembered that at one time she too thought this Inn was romantic and delightful. Then again at that time she was beingembraced by Perry’s young, enthusiastic arms.
“Do try to get some sleep boys, we’ll be paying a surprise visit on the Loves tomorrow and we don’t want to look worn out.”
With a mischievous smirk, Ondine walked up the wooden staircase, which creaked with her every step.
“Someone really should fix this stairway,” Ondine cried. “Visitors should only be announced by a white-gloved butler!”
The young men entered their room and before the door closed behind them they were wrapped in each other’s arms. They kissed quietly, but intently, and fell sideways onto the large king-sized bed. Eucalyptus branches spilled from a vase on the nightstand and their scent, combined with the crisp, fresh air from the slightly opened window made Dash and Llewellyn drowsy. But not drowsy enough to explore each other’s body thoroughly. They never mentioned it, but they knew it would be quite some time before
they would be intimate again.
Father and Daughter
The first thing Edwina did when she entered Nightwind was pull Perry into the greeting room adjacent to the more frequently used front room, and away from the rest of her family. She closed the large French doors behind them so they could have some privacy. It was one of the few moments in her life when she was more confused than angry and
she needed her father’s guidance to help her sort out her emotions. Swimming around in her mind’s eye were the following images: Joe and Amanda making love, Vincent staring lustfully at Amanda, and Vincent and Perry conspiring together in her father’s office. Edwina didn’t like being confused and she was going to put an end to it.
“What the hell is going on, Daddy?” Edwina seethed.
“Your sister,” Perry began. “Obviously has a life kept secret from the rest of this family.”
“Like you don’t?” Edwina retorted. “You don’t think any of us bought Vincent’s carefully worded, but lame, speech do you?”
“What he said was the truth?” Perry stammered.
“Save your indignation for later,” Edwina said. “Right now I want to know what you’re going to do to end this thing between Joe and Amanda.”
“Your sister and your husband have been getting sentimental lately,” Perry said. “But I do not believe it’s been going on for four months.”
“I don’t either, I’m sure I would have suspected something earlier,” Edwina said. “I mean let’s face it Amanda isn’t as clever as me.”
“Agreed,” Perry said. “Well I guess this is the perfect time for Amanda to visit New York.”
Perry, like Madeline, had long ago chosen to align with one daughter over the other. He chose to support Edwina, not because he thought she needed an ally or because he thought she deserved a chance at happiness, but because she was more vindictive and he didn’t want to do battle with her.
“Perfect,” Edwina declared. “Send her off to oversee the Love Foundation and let me remind Joe that he already has a wife, a daughter, and a reputation that he could lose with one well-worded press release written on Love stationery.”
“I fear Joe will never lose Nightfall’s respect,” Perry said.
“If Joe decides he still needs to sow that last wild oat with my sister,” Edwina said. “I guarantee that I will destroy him. I will not lose the man I fought so hard to take.”
“I’ve always said that you’re the most honest of all my children,” Perry said.
“I’m also curious,” Edwina responded. “What’s going on between Amanda and Vincent Savage?”
Just hearing the name of his enemy made Perry’s spine weaken. He didn’t accept Vincent’s explanation that it was mere coincidence that he found Amanda laying on the beach, he knew that Vincent was somehow responsible for Amanda’s collapse. But he couldn’t risk saying anything more to Edwina about his relationship with the vampire. While Edwina had done some unscrupulous things in her life, not even she would be able to understand or forgive Perry for his past actions concerning Vincent.
“I sensed something between them,” Edwina said. “Something primitive.”
“You’re not suggesting that they’ve been physical with each other?” Perry asked, undeniably shocked.
“Oh Daddy, please don’t blush,” Edwina retorted. “Your two daughters have had sex with the same man, and if my suspicions are correct, your only son wouldn’t mind a go at him either.”
“Now you’re talking nonsense!” Perry chaffed.
“Vincent and Amanda have some sort of connection,” Edwina declared. “I’m not sure what it is, but I will find out. And obviously I’ll have to do it without your help.”
“But . . . but . . . ” Perry stammered.
“Don’t stutter Daddy it’s not becoming,” Edwina said. “Now I think it’s time you ordered Amanda to fly to New York.”
Abruptly, Edwina opened the French doors to reveal Madeline and Amanda sitting on the settee and talking quietly in the hallway. Madeline stopped speaking in mid-sentence when she saw Edwina and made no attempt to resume her conversation making it very clear that what she had to say was not for Edwina’s ears.
“Forgive me for interrupting,” Edwina cooed. “But Daddy has an announcement.”
“Couldn’t it keep until tomorrow, Perry?” Madeline asked. “We’re all very tired.”
“No, it’s pressing business,” Edwina responded, “as they say in business. Good night all. I’m going to pay Mr. Savage a visit and thank him for saving my sister. And Amanda, have fun in New York.”
By the time Joe reached David’s corpse, the paramedics had already covered it and laid it on a stretcher. Aimee’s decaying body was also covered and on a stretcher next to David’s. Joe shook his head in dismay and felt incredibly tired. Even in moments of great personal despair he could count on his professional life to offer security and stability, until now. His mind jumped to a time over a decade ago when the same types of killings plagued Nightfall and he knew that he would soon have to go public with this very disturbing information. However, he did command a great deal of respect so he could delay that from happening until he felt the town, and he, were ready.
He pulled the white cotton sheet from what he was told was David’s body and saw his colleague’s face. David’s jaw was still strong, his nose still slightly bent to the left, but the color was completely drained from his face and Joe could even see the bluish veins through his skin. He took a deep breath and turned David’s face to the left and saw the telltale puncture wounds in his neck. How could he tell his fellow officers and
innocent townspeople that a vampire was in their midst? Standing over the two dead bodies, he vowed that the only way he would share the news to anyone would be to also tell them that he wouldn’t rest until he found the vampire and killed him.
Amanda, Madeline, and Perry all looked at the front door that Edwina slammed shut behind her with the same shocked expression, but all for their own particular reasons. Amanda intuitively knew that New York meant working with the Love Foundation, Madeline thought visiting a stranger at such a late hour was in poor taste, and Perry feared that Vincent would reveal his true identity to Edwina. He was about to succumb to the urge to run after his daughter and force her to stay away from Vincent when he heard his wife shouting his name.
“Perry, Perry!” Madeline cried. “What is Edwina talking about?”
“Before you even say another word Dad,” Amanda said. “I have no intention of going to New York.”
Perry felt as restless and frustrated as a laboratory mouse lost within a maze, and unleashed his anger onto his eldest daughter.
“Yes you will! You’re the head of the Love Foundation, there’s a crisis in New York, and that’s where you’re going to go. Tonight!”
Amanda stared at Perry shaking her head in disbelief. “Absolutely not! There is no way that I’m getting on a plane to deal with a business situation tonight, tomorrow, or next week. Were you paying any attention at the hospital Daddy?”
“Of course I was,” Perry said. “You’re pregnant, which doesn’t mean you can’t fly.”
“I can’t believe I’m hearing this!” Amanda cried. “Are you that ignorant that you can’t see how devastating this is to me? If you’d pay attention to me as well as you pay attention to Edwina, you would have heard me tell the doctor that it’s impossible that I’m four months pregnant.”
“Yes I heard what you said to the doctor,” Perry replied. “And so did Edwina.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Madeline asked.
“Amanda would you care to explain?” Perry said.
The three adults were so focused on each other that they didn’t hear Winter walk onto the landing. After her encounter with Adam she was unable to fall back to sleep and the adults in her family were too preoccupied to keep their voices down. With one glance Winter understood that her mother and her grandparents were having an argument. And by the shrill sound of Amanda’s voice, she could tell it was an important one.
“Is that what Edwina’s been filling your head with behind closed doors?” Amanda shouted.
“I have my own eyes and ears, I don’t need any help to see what’s been going on in my home,” Perry said.
“This is ludicrous,” Amanda said. “I’m not having this discussion.”
“Fine, then just pack your bags and leave for New York tonight!” Perry said, grabbing Amanda’s arm.
“I told you I’m not going anywhere!” Amanda screamed. “I’m four months pregnant and I have no idea how I’m in this condition. And I have a daughter upstairs who doesn’t even know yet. How the hell can you ask me to leave town when I haven’t even had a chance to break the news to her?”
“I’ll explain everything to Winter,” Perry said.
“Like hell you will!”Amanda yelled. “It’s time I started being more honest with my daughter. So don’t expect me to leave just because you say so!”
“Don’t use me as an excuse Mother!” Winter cried from the balcony.
“Winter!” Amanda cried.
Standing in her nightgown, clutching the cold marble of the balcony, Winter was in the rare position of having her family’s complete attention so there was no chance she was going to let the moment pass.
“I can’t remember the last time you were honest with me, or with any of us!” Winter shouted down to her mother.
“Winter, let me explain,” Amanda begged. “I just found out.”
“And did you just find out that you’re going to be reunited with Joey?” Winter said very pleased with herself. “That’s right Mother, I know all about the last letter!”
An Expected Visitor
The secret tunnel from Nightwind to the old servant’s quarters took less than fifteen minutes to walk through, but by the time Edwina stood on Vincent’s front porch her cheeks were flushed and her heart was dancing. She felt positively giddy. Edwina never ignored her instinct and ever since she laid eyes on Vincent Savage, her instinct told her that he and her sister were involved. How, she didn’t know, but she was about to find out.
Confidently, she knocked on the door and almost immediately, almost as if he were waiting, Vincent opened the door. Tall and other-worldly he stood in front of her without the faintest look of surprise on his unlined face. Edwina, for the first time in almost two decades, felt self-conscious as Vincent’s eyes traveled languidly from her face to her chest and lower. Involuntarily she rubbed her thighs together feeling a welcomed heat grow from within her, but somewhere from deep within her scarred soul she felt she might have made a mistake coming to this stranger’s door. The heat in her loins was stronger so she chose to stay right where she was.
“Edwina,” Vincent said with a smile. “I knew I would see you again.”
He motioned for her to enter his home and she obeyed, allowing her breast to rub against his chest, which she was delighted to feel was hard as stone. She quickly surveyed the room and realized he had chosen to leave all the old furniture exactly where it was and not clutter the room with mementos, which made her smile as she adored men without any personal baggage. Tossing her wrap on the French Provincial couch, she turned to
Vincent and was struck by his unique beauty.
“Have you slept with my sister?” Edwina inquired.
Winter’s accusation drifted down from the balcony like a reluctant leaf falling from a tree in late autumn. Madeline stared at Amanda with hopeful eyes, while Perry merely stared, but both longed for an explanation. It took Amanda a moment to comprehend what Winter meant since all the confusion surrounding the current child she was carrying had overshadowed the turmoil surrounding her first born.
“Tell them Mother!” Winter shrieked. “Tell them about the last thank-you letter, the one you’ve been hiding from everyone.”
“Amanda, please, what is going on?” Madeline asked softly.
“It’s true,” Amanda managed between swift intakes of breath. “The last thank-you note I received was different.”
“But you told us it was just like all the others,” Perry questioned.
“We didn’t want to get everyone’s hopes up,” Amanda said.
“We?” Madeline asked.
“Joe and I thought it best to keep it to ourselves until we had proof that we would see our son again.”
“Have you heard anything else from the kidnapper?” Perry asked.
“No, nothing,” Amanda said. “Winter that’s why we didn’t say anything. We knew it could be a hoax, that it might never come true.”
“But that’s all you can think about isn’t it? Your other child!” Winter accused. “And now you’re pregnant with another one! Where the hell does that leave me?”
Amanda cried out for her daughter and ran up the marble staircase, but the moment she moved, Winter ran back to her room and locked herself in. Madeline could hear Winter’s sobs mingled with Amanda’s pleas to let her enter Winter’s bedroom, but was powerless to stop the pathetic sounds. Perry’s mind was so filled with his thoughts of Joey, Edwina, and Vincent that he couldn’t hear a sound from upstairs. In fact, when Madeline spoke he was startled.
“I always said that Winter would have been luckier if she had been kidnapped too.”
An Expected Visitor
Humans never ceased to amaze Vincent.
“I said have you slept with my sister?” Edwina repeated.
“A girl with an original opening line,” Vincent said. “I find that provocative.”
“A man with an evasive answer,” Edwina replied. “I find that challenging.”
Feeling a bit more comfortable in the room and much more comfortable in her own skin, Edwina moved closer to Vincent as she continued to interrogate him.
“Now tell me Mr. Savage,” Edwina purred. “Have you ravaged my sister?”
“Are you jealous?”
“Come closer,” Vincent said, enjoying the game Edwina had begun.
Edwina stood inches in front of Vincent and peered up to look into his eyes. She felt weightless as Vincent’s hot breath caressed her face and his wicked grin made her close her eyes with anticipation. Ever since she was a young girl she wanted what her sister had, thinking that if she could touch what Amanda touched maybe she could be as special. She didn’t realize it, but now in the powerful spell of this extraordinary man she was going to get something before Amanda did.
Vincent willed Edwina’s eyes to open and they did. They were filled with such an odd mixture of school girl innocence and street walker apathy that Vincent laughed in her face and broke the preternatural spell he had over her. Edwina responded the same way she always responded when someone laughed in her face, her face coiled into a mask of fury and she lashed out physically. However, Vincent was unlike anyone else who had ever laughed at Edwina so his reaction was unlike any Edwina had ever encountered.
Before Edwina’s red-polished nails could gouge Vincent’s cheek, he grabbed both her arms and pinned them against her side so she couldn’t move. Terror creeped up from that part of her soul that had tried to warn Edwina about this man and although she opened up her mouth to scream only silence emerged. Vincent responded by allowing himself to transform in front of her. His face contorted into an elongated shape, the skin becoming tougher, his eyes turned completely crimson and finally his teeth became sharp fangs that hung over his thin blood-red lips. Edwina’s eyes widened in horror as Vincent pulled Edwina close to him, plunging his teeth into her neck with more force than he usually allowed himself.
Her blood had the robust flavor he cherished and he had to remind himself that he only wanted to sample her offering, not deplete her of her entire supply. He had found his own personal fountain of blood and he wanted to taste her over and over again. Edwina didn’t realize it but she had just become a reservoir for Vincent Savage, a vessel he could return to again and again to graze and guzzle before and after the hunt. He would heal her wounds each time and she wouldn’t remember their encounters. By coming to Vincent’s home willingly, Edwina had unwittingly agreed to play a very special role in his life.
Vincent held Edwina’s head in his large hands and licked a few wayward drops of blood that began to slide down the side of her thin, graceful neck. Edwina roused without opening her eyes and mumbled, “Who are you?”
Vincent paused then bent closer to her ear and whispered: “I am your brother.”",0.9850330352783203,9146,0.5431245565414429

"One of the debt charity StepChange’s advisers moved on earlier this year. His farewell blog post was very informative: a good example of the advice that’s available regularly on their blog. I am sure he – and StepChange – will not object to my quoting it.
“Six truths about debt I’ve found from working at StepChange Debt Charity” (Matthew Cooper)
Truth 1: Creditors will generally accept your best offer of payment
Provided that they are convinced it really is your best offer, I’ve usually thought this to be true. But Matthew’s evidence in support of the theory is amazing: only one proposal rejected … out of 300!
“My job was to give advice on debt solutions and draft the actual individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) documents for clients. I drafted around 300 IVA proposals in about two years. All but one of them were accepted by creditors. I learned that if you make your best offer to creditors they’ll generally be willing to accept.”
Truth 2: Debt can happen to anyone
That’s something I found when researching stories for my book ‘Back to the Black.’ Matthew confirms this:
“While working as an IVA drafter I heard many stories of how people ended up in debt. In most cases debt problems are caused by life-changing events such as unemployment, relationship breakdown, accident or illness.”
Truth 3: Bust out the budget
Here’s the painful part, when you move out of the “denial” phase and start to analyse your financial position. Some humourist once said “A budget is a mathematical confirmation of your suspicions” … but it’s surprisingly true that knowing the worst is less stressful, compared with suspecting the worst but not being sure. Then, when you have an accurate picture of your current situation, you can start to draft a budget (maybe a few versions for different scenarios: see my book) that’ll help you decide what to do next. Matthew says:
“In my time here I’ve helped a lot of clients to put together a budget; as someone who is keen on budgeting I was sometimes amazed that some had never put an accurate budget together before. Over the years I’ve seen the clients who paid careful attention to their budgets be successful in repaying their debts. I now spend at least an hour a week looking over my budget to make sure I stay on track. An emergency fund is also a vital part of a budget, whether you have debts or not.”
Truth 4: Credit isn’t necessarily bad
“I’ve learned that credit isn’t necessarily a bad thing in itself and, like most things in life, it can even be good in moderation. It’s vital not to over-commit yourself though and you should be prepared as your life can change at any time. Despite their bad press creditors aren’t all bad either, as long as you’re honest about your situation. As a charity we want to help the ‘can’t pays’ rather than the ‘won’t pays’; creditors tend to share this attitude.”
That’s an interesting statement right there at the end: the “can’t pays,” as he puts it, are the group that StepChange exists to help; and they are the group with whom creditors are more likely to negotiate reasonably.
Truth 5: Never pay for debt advice
“I’ve also learnt that there is genuinely no need to EVER pay for debt advice. Our advisors are brilliantly trained and highly knowledgeable and will always strive to give the best advice for your personal situation. We’re not for profit but we are for giving best advice.”
Truth 6: My colleagues are great at helping people in debt
I’ve never spoken to those colleagues personally; my own crisis was back in the ‘90s. However, judging by the quality of the info on their blog, I would support that statement 100%. So I’m sure Matthew won’t mind if I repeat in full his plug for his colleagues:
“I’ve made some great friends while working for the charity and together we’ve served a great common cause – ‘free debt advice’. My colleagues are knowledgeable, committed, ethical, funny and warm and they treat people who contact us with a great deal of empathy and never judge them. It’s time for me to hand over to another person to take on my role now. I hope they enjoy it and learn as much as I did during my time with this great charity.”
Citizens Advice was the charity that helped me with my debt crisis, largely because they had a Bureau near me where I could have face-to-face meetings. However they are a generalist advice charity, whereas StepChange is a debt specialist.
And judging by their blog, an excellent one.

"The winter months are the dormant season for most plants here in the Pacific Northwest, so it can be easy to overlook what a landscape has to offer. Still, reliable favorites like Hellebore, Sarcococca (Sweet Box), Snow Drops and Witch Hazel have been in full bloom since the beginning of the year. These plants are excellent choices near entries or frequently used pathways where you will see them even on dark, rainy days.
While you may not be outdoors as much as you would like, you can still see and enjoy your garden from inside your home. This is a good time to think about the views and how to make the most of them. Landscape lighting can enhance focal areas and extend viewing time while creating some interesting after-hours effects. You can add depth and character to your garden with something as simple as strategically placed uplighting on the peeling bark of a specimen tree or wash lighting on a plant with big leaves that create dramatic shadows. Lighting can open up a nighttime world in your back yard.
Here are a few ideas for using accent lighting outside your home. In a woodland setting, I use lighting sparingly and prefer soft, muted effects. Washing the trunk and primary branches of a mature Douglas fir provides ambient lighting throughout the garden. An uplight focused on the canopy of a Japanese maple provides a focal point and sense of scale in the garden at night. Whether your landscaping is modern, natural or traditional in style, lighting can enhance and define it at night.
Consider using low-voltage LED lighting, which can be installed without involving an electrician — all it requires is a nearby electrical outlet. It’s simple to position lights exactly where they need to be for optimal affects and to move them around later as plants grow and your garden changes.
When I’m designing garden lighting, I consider the style, location and size of the garden. I take into account needs such as security, safety, ambient light, focal points and dramatic effects. Primarily, it’s a matter of deciding what kind and how much lighting supports the form and the function of your garden.
Winter is a good time to look at your current outdoor lighting. Does it meet to your needs for safety and security? Is it harsh or distracting? Does it flatter and enhance your garden at night? Now is a good time to get started on lighting and other outdoor improvements so you can enjoy them this summer.
I hope this blog post helps you get started thinking about enhancing your garden with lighting. If you need more ideas, contact me for a design consultation and learn about lighting, design or the best plants for any spot in your garden.",0.9521272778511047,544,1.7113208770751953

"The water emergency along the California-Oregon line went from desperate to cataclysmic this week as government controllers shut off water system water to ranchers from a basic supply and said they would not send additional water to biting the dust salmon downstream or to about six untamed life shelters that harbor a great many moving birds every year.
In the thing is turning out to be the most exceedingly terrible water emergency in ages, the U.S. Authority of Reclamation said it won’t deliver water this season into the fundamental channel that takes care of the main part of the gigantic Klamath Reclamation Project, denoting a first for the 114-year-old water system framework. The office reported a month ago that many irrigators would get drastically less water than expected, yet a demolishing dry season picture implies water will be totally stopped all things being equal.
The whole area is in outrageous or outstanding dry spell, as per government checking reports, and Oregon’s Klamath County is encountering its driest year in 127 years.
“The current year’s dry spell conditions are carrying uncommon difficulty to the networks of the Klamath Basin,” said Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, calling the choice one of “memorable outcome.” “Recovery is devoted to working with our water clients, clans and accomplices to traverse this troublesome year and growing long haul answers for the bowl.”
The channel, a significant part of the governmentally worked Klamath Reclamation Project, pipes Klamath River water from the Upper Klamath Lake only north of the Oregon-California line to in excess of 130,000 sections of land (52,600 hectares), where ages of farmers and ranchers have developed roughage, hay and potatoes and munched steers.
Just a single water system locale inside the 200,000-section of land (80,940-hectare) undertaking will get any water from the Klamath River framework this developing season, and it will have a seriously restricted stock, the Klamath Water Users Association said in an articulation. Some different ranchers depend on water from an alternate waterway, and they will likewise have a restricted stock.
“This equitable couldn’t be more terrible,” said Klamath Irrigation District president Ty Kliewer. “The effects on our family cultivates and these rustic networks will be off the scale.”
Simultaneously, the office said it would not delivery any alleged “flushing streams” from a similar dam on the Upper Klamath Lake to support water levels downstream in the lower Klamath River. The stream is critical to the endurance of coho salmon, which are recorded as compromised under the Endangered Species Act. In better water years the beats of water help keep the waterway cool and tempestuous — conditions that help the delicate species. The fish are fundamental to the eating regimen and culture of the Yurok Tribe, California’s biggest governmentally perceived clan.
The clan said for the current week that low moves from dry spell and from past blunder of the stream by the government organization was causing a cease to exist of adolescent salmon from a bacterial sickness that twists when water levels are low. Yurok fish scholars who have been trying the infant salmon in the lower Klamath River are tracking down that 70% of the fish are now dead in the snares used to gather them and 97% are tainted by the microbes known as C. shasta.
“At the present time, the Klamath River is brimming with dead and passing on fish on the Yurok Reservation,” said Frankie Myers, bad habit director of the Yurok Tribe. “This sickness will execute the greater part of the infant salmon in the Klamath, which will affect fish runs for a long time to come. For salmon individuals, an adolescent fish slaughter is a most horrendous case situation.”
Irrigators, in the interim, responded with doubt as the information on a water shut-off in the channels spread. A bulletin distributed by the Klamath Water Users Association, which addresses a considerable lot of the locale’s ranchers, boomed the feature, “Most exceedingly terrible Day in the History of the Klamath Project.” Farmers revealed previously seeing residue storms that darkened vision for 100 yards (91 meters), and they stressed over their wells running dry.
Around 30 dissenters showed up Thursday at the head entryways of the primary dam to fight the shut-off and ask the water system locale to challenge government arranges and redirect the water. The Herald and News announced that they were with a gathering called People’s Rights, an extreme right association established by hostile to government dissident Ammon Bundy.
Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, the two Democrats, have pronounced dry spell crises around there, and the Bureau of Reclamation has saved $15 million in prompt guide for irrigators. Another $10 million will be accessible for dry spell help from the U.S. Branch of Agriculture.
Ben DuVal, leader of the Klamath Water Users Association, encouraged his individuals to stay serene and not let the water emergency “be seized for different causes.”
The occasional assignments are the area’s most emotional improvement since water system water was everything except slice off to many ranchers in 2001 in the midst of another serious dry spell — the first run through ranchers’ inclinations assumed a lower priority in relation to fish and clans.
The emergency made the country cultivating area many miles from any significant city a public political flashpoint and turned into a standard for Republicans who utilized the emergency to train in on the Endangered Species Act, with one GOP administrator calling the water system shutoff a “perfect example” for why changes were required. A “can unit” fight pulled in 15,000 individuals who scooped water from the Klamath River and passed it, hand over hand, to a dry water system trench.
The circumstance in the Klamath Basin was gotten under way over a century prior, when the U.S. government started depleting an organization of shallow lakes and marshlands, diverting the normal progression of water and building many miles of waterways and waste channels to make farmland. Residences were offered by lottery to World War II veterans.
The venture transformed the district into a horticultural force to be reckoned with — a portion of its potato ranchers supply In ‘N Out burger — however for all time modified an unpredictable water framework that traverses many miles and from southern Oregon to Northern California.
In 1988, two types of sucker fish were recorded as imperiled under government law. Not exactly 10 years after the fact, coho salmon that produce downstream from the recovery project, in the lower Klamath River, were recorded as compromised.
The water important to support the coho salmon downstream comes from Upper Klamath Lake — the primary holding tank for the ranchers’ water system framework. Simultaneously, the sucker fish in the lake need at any rate 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 centimeters) of water covering the rock beds they use as bringing forth grounds.",0.947536051273346,1508,2.110399007797241

"Are you dying to find out what it takes to be a plus-size model? Thanks to a number of boundary pushing models, designers and activists, there is more plus size visibility in the world of fashion than ever before. Plus size modeling opportunities are increasing across the industry, even in Honolulu, Hawaii. Jobs you will see range from catalog and commercial jobs to swimsuit modeling, magazine editorials and even runway shows.
These days, it’s not just plus size clothing brands looking to cast full figured models: more and more straight size brands (those catering to a size 12 and under) are extending their sizing or rolling out entire plus size collections. Therefore, there has never been a better time to become a plus-size model.
If you want to apply to a plus size model fashion agency, you should know what size is considered plus size. Plus size model sizes vary by brand and agency. Plus- size modeling in Honolulu, Hawaii is generally a size 12 and up. Plus size models are typically evaluated and cast based on dress size rather than body measurements. As a general rule, plus-size models are defined by the fashion industry as anyone larger than a size 6.
These days, however, most women deemed plus size models are a size 12/14 or higher, bringing the industry’s perception with what counts as a plus size model a little more in line with that of the public. The industry’s exacting standards about height and other aspects of models’ appearance certainly still remain the same for the most part. Plus size fashion models are generally 5’9” and up and are asked to have unblemished skin, healthy hair and well-kept nails. Plus size fit models can be shorter—between 5’6” and 5’9”, while commercial modeling gigs (a.k.a. Real people modeling) offer more flexibility. Though, there have been exceptions to that rule with the famous plus-size model Tess Holliday at the height of 5 '5 ``.",0.9529097676277161,417,1.3136647939682007

"A dynamic and versatile talent, Samantha Fish has vastly expanded her musical reach in the past year by releasing two albums with strong musical themes. Fish’s 2017 releases of Chills & Fever and Belle of the West have displayed the guitarist and vocalist’s talents of delivering high-quality performances of diverse genres and hence, propelled her to an artistic level far beyond that of merely a top-notch blues rocker.
Fish is from Kansas City, and got her musical start as a drummer before deciding to re-focus on the guitar in her mid teens. She simultaneously began to gain a great appreciation for the blues by attending several shows of the touring blues artists at local clubs and eventually began joining some on stage for brief performances. From these performances and her eventual full-time gigs, Fish recorded and released Live Bait, her 2009 debut live album. The success of this debut, caught the attention of German based Ruf Records, who coordinated a collaboration with fellow blues artists Cassie Taylor and Dani Wilde for the 2011 album Girls with Guitars and the subsequent, successful world tour and 2012 collaborative live album.
Fish then formed the Samantha Fish Band and, over the next several years toured constantly while recording her initial three solo studio albums, Runaway in 2011, Black Wind Howlin’ in 2013, and Wild Heart in 2015. During this time, Samantha also participated in some collaborations with established blues artists such as Jimmy Hall, Reese Wynans, Devon Allman and Buddy Guy and won the 2012 Blues Music Award for Best New Artist.

Samantha traveled to Detroit to record Chills & Fever, an album of reinterpreted versions of mainly Motown, soul and R&B covers of songs from the 1960s and 1970s. This was a completely different musical approach than her previous albums in both musical genre and instrumental arrangement, with backing by a group of musicians collectively known as The Detroit Cobras and with Fish’s vocals talents taking on an increasing level of importance. The album starts with one of its best tracks, “He Did It”, where Fish converts a situation of bitterness and sadness into a pleasant progression of happy-go-lucky rock n’ soul with just enough of brass and backing vocals to decorating it finely. Originally written by Jackie DeShannon as “She Did It” and later adapted by The Ronettes, this a song which Fish truly makes her own and provides a strong guitar lead.
The album’s title track, “Chills & Fever” follows as a perfect update to sixties jazz pop track by Tom Jones and a song with a smokey and sweet vocal delivery. It features an expert electric piano lead by Bob Mervak followed by the nicely contrasted, wah-wah infused guitar lead by Samantha, both of which work to fit perfectly with this song’s overall vibe. Next up in the album’s sequence comes a soulful rendition of Barbara Lewis’s “Hello Stranger”, a bluesy version of Imelda May’s “It’s Your Voodoo Working”, and and excited version of the Jerry Ragovoy ballad “Hurts All Gone”.
A modern version of Lonnie Lester’s beat-driven “You Can’t Go” provides more Motown / soul accents along with a heavy dose of the Stax Records style. Fish then does a beautiful rendition of the classic “Either Way I Lose”, a song written by Van McCoy and made famous by the likes of Gladys Knight and Nina Simone. Highlighted here is Samantha’s soaring and soulful vocals and deliberate, bluesy guitar lead over the deliberative and simple beat. “Never Gonna Cry” is another excellent overall tune built on an ascending phrase, cool organ and just the right amount brass by trumpeter Mark Levron and saxophonist Travis Blotsky.
Coming down the stretch of Chills & Fever, we find more solid (albeit less memorable) tracks. “Little Baby” has a revival-like vibe with a country-esque guitar lead and piano, while Alan Toussaint’s “Nearer to You” further takes on a Gospel-like feel. Betty LaVette’s “You’ll Never Change” is a true blues cover, followed by a version of Skip James’ “Crow Jane” and two “bonus” tracks for newer versions of the album, Ted Taylor’s “Someoneâ€™s Always Tryin'” and a choppy, entertaining cover of Lulu’s “I’ll Come Runnin'”.
Produced by Bobby Harlow and released in March 2017, Chills & Fever is overall a standout for Samantha’s guitar and vocal style as she adds a bluesy element to these (mainly) lesser known classics with solid production and outstanding musicianship.
Released in November 2017, Belle of the West saw Samantha Fish go to Zebra Ranch Studios in Northern Mississippi with producer Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstar’s fame and with whom she had worked previously on her 2015 album Wild Heart. The album also features a completely new crop of backing musicians as Fish takes another sharp musical turn with a rootsy, acoustic-driven album of mainly original compositions, with a trio select cover songs. RL Burnside’s “Poor Black Mattie” featuring some guitar, harmonica and vocals by guest Lightnin’ Malcolm. Likewise, Lillie Mae Rische provides violin and vocals on her composition, “Nearing Home”, a duet with a different style than everything else on this album. The third cover on the album is the Jimbo Mathus-written title track with an old-fashioned Country and Western waltz in the same fashion as many Loretta Lynn classics.
“American Dream” is the album’s opening track with country-tinged blues and sweet instrumentation on a topical tune which reaches for the essence of Americana. This is followed by the calm shuffle with slightly piercing guitar strum of “Blood in the Water”, which features some smoky vocals which float over the soft guitar and subtle violin.
The Americana/Country/Bluegrass vibes continue with the acoustic waltz “Need You More”, the storytelling diddy “Cowtown” and the melodic “Daughters”, which lyrically references the geographic area. The edgy ballad “Donâ€™t Say That You Love Me” follows as a straight-up blues tune with some fine phrasing and a haunting fiddle by Little Mae. “No Angels” is another authentic sounding Mississippi blues tune where Fish’s vocals really shine, leading to the upbeat closer “Gone for Good”, with cool guitars and intense vocals.
Samantha Fish called Belle of the West a “storytelling record by a girl who grew up in the Midwest” that is “very personal” and brings “another dimension” to her music. She continues to tour to support this album in 2018 and, following her incredible duo of terrific, yet distinct sounding albums from last year, it will be very interesting to see where her musical output leads to next.

"Following the launch of its Lokiša Kgwebo Ya Gago/ Qondis’ Ishishini Lakho/Fix Your Business/ Maak Reg Jou Besigheid information sessions, the city’s Local Economic Development (LED) Services has observed that many foreign nationals attending are accompanied by South Africans attempting to assist them to illegally register their spaza shop businesses.
LED strongly condemns this practice and warns that action will be taken against those found to be involved as this undermines the municipality’s efforts to compile accurate data and enforce compliance with regulations. Residents are further forewarned that under the Immigration Act of 2002, it is a criminal offence to assist or enable an undocumented foreign national to operate a business in South Africa.
In cases where public health issues such as food poisoning arise from these spaza shops/businesses, registered owners and not persons operating the shops will be held legally accountable. This includes any hospitalisations or fatalities that may result, making it crucial for locals to assess the risks of associating themselves with such conduct.
LED also encourage all local property owners leasing their premises to business owners to ensure that they comply with the request to formally register their business by 13 December 2024. Several requirements need to be met to ensure the successful registration of a spaza shops/business. These include a correctly completed application form obtainable from our Enterprise and Rural Development offices or downable on our website accompanied by proof of residence, business registration with CIPC and proof of ownership or permission to utilise the business premises.
In addition to the above, a zoning certificate, consent use comment from municipality’s Town Planning Division as well as a certificate of acceptability from Environmental Health and a municipality-determined payment must be submitted and approved before a business licence can be issued.
Foreign nationals will be required to also provide valid documentation from the Department of Home Affairs, giving them authorisation to operate a business in South Africa. This must be in the form of a valid temporary or permanent residence visa or an asylum seekers/refugee permit.
Prior to issuing out a permit, the municipality will also conduct background checks in collaboration with law enforcement agencies, to verify the legality of the applicant’s business activities. Once the applicant satisfies all the conditions stated by the municipality, they will be issued with a registration card or permit that must always be displayed and available for inspections.",0.9409525990486145,486,1.4107074737548828
"Contemporary African photography captures the essence of the continent’s diverse culture, history, and identity. As the global art scene has evolved, African photographers have gained increased recognition for their unique perspectives and contributions to the world of photography. This journal will explore the rich history and themes of contemporary African photography, highlighting the work of influential photographers and examining their impact on the global art scene. Furthermore, it will discuss the future of African photography, emphasizing the importance of promoting and supporting the continent’s vibrant and diverse creative talents.
Historical background of African photography
Notable early African photographers include Seydou Keïta (1921-2001), J.D. ‘Okhai Ojeikere, Adama Kouyaté (1928-2020) and Malick Sidibé (1935-2016). These pioneers captured the essence of African society and culture, providing a window into the continent’s complex history. They often documented significant events, such as independence movements and the evolution of traditional customs, while also portraying everyday life.
The colonial era had a profound impact on African photography. European colonizers sought to impose their own cultural and aesthetic ideals onto African art forms. However, African photographers resisted this cultural imperialism by creating their own visual narratives, portraying the richness and complexity of the continent’s diverse cultures.
Postcolonial African photography emerged as a powerful force, challenging the stereotypes perpetuated by colonial imagery. This new generation of photographers embraced their own unique perspectives and experiences, redefining African photography’s role in global art discourse.
Major themes in contemporary African photography
Social and political issues
Contemporary African photographers often address pressing social and political issues in their work. For example, post-Apartheid South African photographers such as Zanele Muholi and David Goldblatt have documented the complex legacy of racial segregation and social inequality. Other photographers, like Omar Victor Diop and Leila Alaoui, explore themes of migration and displacement, capturing the struggles and triumphs of African people in the face of adversity.
Gender, sexuality, and identity are also central themes in contemporary African photography. Photographers like Nandipha Mntambo and Mimi Cherono Ng’ok challenge conventional norms and expectations by exploring diverse expressions of gender and sexuality, providing representation for marginalized communities.
Cultural and environmental preservation
African photographers often seek to preserve and celebrate their continent’s rich cultural and environmental heritage. Through their work, they highlight the importance of indigenous traditions, customs, and the relationship between humans and nature. For instance, Kenyan photographer Cyrus Kabiru creates stunning images that fuse traditional and modern elements, showcasing the unique beauty of African landscapes and urban spaces.
Aesthetic and experimental approaches
Contemporary African photographers are also known for their innovative and experimental approaches to the medium. The African diaspora has played a significant role in shaping the aesthetics of contemporary African photography, as artists like Awol Erizku and Tahir Carl Karmali draw inspiration from their diverse backgrounds and experiences. These photographers often incorporate cutting-edge technology and digital techniques into their work, pushing the boundaries of the medium.

Education and mentorship play a vital role in nurturing new talent and ensuring the continued development of the medium. Initiatives like photography workshops, exhibitions, and mentorship programs provide emerging photographers with the resources and guidance needed to hone their skills and share their unique perspectives.
The impact of social media and digital platforms on African photography cannot be understated. These platforms provide artists with a global audience, fostering international collaborations and exposing their work to new viewers. African photographers can now share their images and stories with a broader audience, transcending geographical boundaries and breaking down cultural barriers.
Collaborations between African photographers and other creative disciplines, such as fashion, film, and fine art, further enrich the medium and create opportunities for cross-disciplinary experimentation. These collaborations often result in innovative and groundbreaking works that challenge the boundaries of traditional photography and redefine the possibilities of the medium.
Contemporary African photography offers a unique and vital perspective on the world, capturing the complexities of the continent’s history, culture, and identity. The works of influential African photographers have left an indelible mark on the global art scene, contributing to a richer understanding of the human experience. By promoting and supporting African photography, we can ensure that these diverse and powerful voices continue to be heard and celebrated.
The potential of contemporary African photography is immense, with talented artists across the continent pushing the boundaries of the medium and shaping the future of global art. As we continue to support and engage with the work of these artists, we can foster a greater appreciation for the richness and diversity of African photography and, in turn, contribute to a more inclusive and culturally rich global dialogue.

"The Role of Bond Market Index Funds in Passive Investing
Passive investing, often associated with index funds, has gained significant popularity among investors seeking a low-cost and diversified approach to portfolio management. While equity index funds have long been recognized for their benefits, bond market index funds are also playing a crucial role in passive investing. In this article, we will explore the role of bond market index funds in passive investing and discuss their advantages for investors.
Understanding Bond Market Index Funds
Bond market index funds are investment vehicles designed to track the performance of a specific bond market index, such as the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. These funds seek to replicate the index’s composition and investment characteristics, providing investors with exposure to a broad range of bonds within a particular market segment.
Unlike actively managed bond funds, which rely on the expertise of portfolio managers to select and manage individual bonds, bond market index funds follow a passive investment strategy. They aim to match the performance of the underlying index rather than outperform it. As a result, these funds typically have lower management fees compared to actively managed funds.
Advantages of Bond Market Index Funds in Passive Investing
- Diversification: Bond market index funds offer instant diversification across a wide range of bonds. The underlying index includes bonds from various sectors, issuers, maturities, and credit ratings. By investing in a bond market index fund, investors gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of bonds, spreading risk and reducing the impact of individual bond defaults or rating downgrades.
- Cost Efficiency: Bond market index funds are known for their low expense ratios. Since these funds do not require active management and extensive research, they have lower operating expenses compared to actively managed funds. The lower costs allow investors to keep more of their investment returns, enhancing their long-term wealth accumulation.
- Transparency: Bond market index funds provide transparency in their holdings. The composition of the underlying index is typically publicly available, allowing investors to see the specific bonds held in the fund. This transparency enables investors to understand the risks associated with the fund and make informed decisions based on their investment objectives.
- Consistency: Passive investing through bond market index funds offers consistency in investment performance. These funds aim to closely track the performance of the underlying index, providing investors with a predictable return pattern. This consistency can be particularly valuable for investors with a long-term investment horizon or those seeking stability in their bond portfolio.
- Lower Manager Risk: Active bond fund management introduces the risk of poor investment decisions or underperformance by the fund manager. In contrast, bond market index funds eliminate this manager risk by tracking a predetermined index. Investors are not dependent on the skill or judgment of a portfolio manager, which can provide peace of mind and reduce uncertainty.
- Accessibility: Bond market index funds are widely available to individual investors. They can be purchased through brokerage accounts, retirement plans, or investment platforms. This accessibility allows investors of all levels of experience and wealth to participate in passive bond investing and benefit from the advantages it offers.
Considerations for Bond Market Index Fund Investors
While bond market index funds offer numerous benefits, investors should consider a few factors:
- Interest Rate Risk: Bond market index funds are not immune to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices typically decline, impacting the value of the underlying bonds in the fund. Investors should be aware of the potential impact of changing interest rates on the performance of bond market index funds.
- Bond Market Dynamics: Bond market index funds may not capture specific market opportunities or take advantage of mispricing in individual bonds. They provide exposure to the overall performance of the bond market segment but do not offer the potential for outperformance through active management.
- Credit Risk: While bond market index funds diversify credit risk to some extent, investors should be mindful of the credit quality of the underlying bonds. Some bond market indexes include a mix of investment-grade and high-yield bonds, which carry different levels of credit risk.
Bond market index funds play a crucial role in passive investing, offering investors a cost-efficient, diversified, and transparent approach to bond investing. With their low expense ratios, broad market exposure, and consistent performance, these funds provide an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term wealth accumulation through fixed-income investments. By understanding the advantages and considerations of bond market index funds, investors can make informed decisions and build a well-rounded investment portfolio.",0.9300578236579895,910,1.436837911605835

"Explaining the Key Points of the Amended 'Japanese Whistleblower Protection Act': What Measures Should Businesses Take?
The Japanese Whistleblower Protection Act was amended in 2020 and came into effect on June 1, 2022. This amendment imposed obligations on businesses to establish systems to properly respond to internal reports.
In this article, we will explain the key points of the amendment to the Japanese Whistleblower Protection Act and the measures that businesses should take in response to this amendment.
What is the Whistleblower Protection System?
The “Whistleblower Protection System” is a system designed to protect individuals who provide information about incidents or misconduct for the public good (whistleblowers).
For instance, corporate misconduct or scandals such as hiding automobile recalls or food misrepresentation are often difficult to detect from the outside, and many cases are revealed through internal whistleblowing. However, some people hesitate to report because they fear they may suffer disadvantages within the company. To avoid this, it is necessary to ensure that internal whistleblowers do not receive unfavorable treatment such as dismissal.
Internal whistleblowing is beneficial for organizations as it allows for early detection and response to problems or misconduct. Furthermore, protecting whistleblowers and appropriately handling their reports promotes the organization’s self-purification, enhances social credibility, and improves corporate value.
The Whistleblower Protection System aims to promote compliance with laws and regulations by businesses and ensure the safety and peace of mind of the public by protecting internal whistleblowers from this perspective.
Key Points of the Amendment to the Japanese Whistleblower Protection Act
The amendment in 2020 (Reiwa 2) was implemented to enhance the effectiveness of the internal reporting system. The following points are included in this amendment.
Mandatory System Development for Businesses
Businesses are obligated to do the following (Article 11 of the Japanese Whistleblower Protection Act).
- Designate a person in charge of handling public interest reports
- Develop a system necessary for appropriately responding to internal reports
However, for small and medium-sized enterprises with a workforce (including part-time workers) of 300 or less, these are only obligations to make an effort.
When the Prime Minister deems it necessary, he/she can request a report from the business and provide advice, guidance, and recommendations (Article 15 of the same Act). If the business does not comply with the recommendations, it can be publicly announced (Article 16 of the same Act).
Furthermore, the person in charge of handling public interest reports is obligated to keep confidential any information that can identify the whistleblower. If this confidentiality obligation is violated, a fine of up to 300,000 yen may be imposed (Articles 12 and 21 of the same Act).
The information that can identify the whistleblower includes the whistleblower’s name, employee number, etc., and even general information such as gender can be applicable if it can identify the whistleblower when combined with other information.
Making it Easier to Report to Administrative Agencies, etc.
If a company dismisses a whistleblower for reporting to an administrative agency or a media organization, the requirements for the dismissal to be invalid have been relaxed, making it easier to report (Article 3 of the same Act).
In the case of reporting to an administrative agency, not only the conventional “when there is a reasonable reason to believe,” but also “when a document with the name, address, etc. is submitted” has been added to the requirements.
For reporting to media organizations, the pre-amendment was only harm to life or body, but after the amendment, “harm to property” was added. Also, “when there is a reasonable reason to believe that the company will leak information identifying the whistleblower” was added.
Expanding the Protection of Whistleblowers
Previously, only employees were subject to protection, but with the amendment, retirees within one year of retirement and officers were also added (Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the same Act).
With the addition of officers to the protection targets, disadvantageous treatment of officers is prohibited, and if an officer is dismissed due to a public interest report, it is now possible to claim damages (Article 5, Paragraph 3, and Article 6 of the same Act). In addition, the scope of protected reports, which used to be only criminal penalties, has been expanded to include administrative penalties (Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the same Act).
In addition to the invalidation of dismissal due to reporting and the prohibition of disadvantageous treatment such as demotion and pay cuts, it is now prohibited for businesses to claim damages from whistleblowers on the grounds of damage caused by public interest reports (Article 7 of the same Act).
Expanding the Scope of Facts that are Subject to Protected Reporting
This amendment has expanded the scope of facts that are subject to protected reporting (Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the same Act).
It is stipulated as “the fact of a criminal act of a crime stipulated in this law and the laws listed in the appendix (including orders based on these laws.) or the fact that is the reason for the fine stipulated in this law and the laws listed in the appendix (including orders based on these laws.).”
This “law listed in the appendix” is defined in the “Ordinance to Specify the Laws in Appendix 8 of the Whistleblower Protection Act (Ordinance No. 146 of 2005)” based on the Appendix and Appendix 8 of the Whistleblower Protection Act. The list of laws is published by the Consumer Affairs Agency as “List of Laws Subject to Reporting (474 as of February 1, Reiwa 3).”
Measures Businesses Should Take to Properly Respond to Internal Reporting
Businesses with more than 300 employees need to understand the obligations imposed by the recent amendments and respond appropriately. Here, we will explain the measures that businesses should take.
Establishing a System to Properly Respond to Internal Reporting
The Japanese Whistleblower Protection Act does not specify how to set up an internal reporting system, leaving the actual form of the reporting system up to the discretion of the business. There are various cases to consider, such as setting up a reporting system within the organization, such as the HR department, outsourcing the reporting system to an external organization like a law firm, or setting up reporting systems in both places.
No matter what form is chosen, the following points must be adhered to:
- Establishment of an internal public interest reporting system: Clearly define the department or person responsible for investigations and corrective actions.
- Measures to ensure independence from the head of the organization and other executives: Ensure independence from the head of the organization and other executives in cases involving them.
- Measures related to the implementation of public interest reporting response tasks: Conduct internal investigations and implement corrective actions.
- Measures to eliminate conflicts of interest in public interest reporting response tasks: Prevent those involved in the case from participating in public interest reporting response tasks.
Businesses must designate personnel to handle public interest reporting response tasks, receive public interest reports, conduct internal investigations, and, if necessary, implement corrective actions.
Establishing a System to Protect Whistleblowers
Even if an internal reporting system is established, the whistleblower protection system will not function properly unless the protection of the reporter is ensured. Therefore, businesses need to take the following measures:
- Measures to prevent disadvantageous treatment: Prevent disadvantageous treatment and provide relief if such treatment is discovered. Take disciplinary action against those who have treated others disadvantageously, etc.
- Measures to prevent sharing outside the scope: Prevent sharing outside the scope and provide relief if such sharing is discovered, etc.
Disadvantageous treatment of whistleblowers includes not only dismissal but also pay cuts, demotions, and forced retirement.
For the measures that businesses should take, please refer to the Guidelines necessary for businesses to take measures based on the provisions of Article 11, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Japanese Whistleblower Protection Act, in order to ensure their appropriate and effective implementation[ja] (Cabinet Office Notice No. 118 of August 20, Reiwa 3 (2021)).
Summary: Consult a Lawyer for Measures Regarding the Whistleblower Protection Act
The Whistleblower Protection Act has been amended, and businesses are now required to establish systems to properly respond to internal reports. This has increased the responsibilities that companies must fulfill. Furthermore, when a report is made, it is necessary to have a system in place in advance to properly respond to it.
Protecting whistleblowers and responding sincerely to their reports is important not only for businesses but also for society. For matters concerning the Whistleblower Protection System, please consult a lawyer.

"I've had numerous conversations with others about this topic. My fiancé often tells me that one of the most powerful gifts God gave was free will. What does it mean?
It means an unprecedented power like no other. True freedom of choice. A freedom to create your own destiny, way of life, etc. What may be powerful to you is going to look different than what may be powerful to others.
I had the oppourtunity to be whatever I want to be in life--I still do. To me, becoming a nurses was something that I focused on until the dream became a reality. Now that the dream is accomplished, I can create something more or less--it is up to me. How enormous is that?
The funny thing about power is the responsibility of it all. Whatever you decide to do with it, you must be willing to face all of the costs and benefits of it. Whatever decision you made is going to have rewards and consequences. However, let the benefits outweigh the risks.
Don't let your power escape from you. It's truly sad when one doesn't recognize the power that they have and squander it away. Make up in your mind that you have the power and no one will take that away from you. People will ridicule you and try to talk you out of what you are destined to do--don't let it happen. Pursue whatever dream you have in your heart, mind, and soul and pursue it.
As the picture states, YOU create YOUR own oppourtunities.

"Originally, it was a group of twelve German-speaking traction cities who joined together to resist the advance of the Green Storm in destroying all traction cities. The Green Storm were seeming to win until many more cities joined the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft. This led to a stalemate with neither side willing to give. Cities who did not join the Traktionstadtsgellschaft often sent money or supplies to help in the war, and also profited from selling the alliance weapons. The cities agreed not to prey on each other until the war was over; instead eating Mossie ships and forts as food, though some less-ethical towns such as Harrowbarrow continued hunting for prey as they thought the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft would turn them soft.
The Traktionstadtsgesellschaft was shattered when the Stalker Fang attacked and destroyed most of it's bigger cities with ODIN. With the end of the war and the deaths of the Stalker Fang and General Jiang Xiang Naga, the remnants of the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft settled down and became static, as per the treaty struck between the leader of the newly reformed Anti-Traction League Oenone Zero and Kriegsmarshal Von Kobold to cease fighting forever.
Fourteen years earlier, while Wren was busy learning to crawl and alarming her parents by eating stones, beetles, and small ornaments, the Green Storm had swept down from their strongholds in the mountains of Shan Guo to spread war and destruction across the Great Hunting Ground. Their air-fleets and Stalker armies had surged westward, herding terrified Traction Cities ahead of them and destroying any that did not flee fast enough. Then Arminius Krause, the burgermeister of Traktionstadt Weimar, had sent envoys to eleven other German-speaking cities and proposed that they join together and turn to face the Storm before every mobile town and city was driven off the western edge of the Hunting Ground into the sea.
And so the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft was born. The twelve great cities, swiftly joined by others, swore that they would eat no mobile town until the Green Storm was destroyed. They would survive instead by devouring Mossie ships and forts and static settlements until they had made the world safe again for Municipal Darwinism, which every civilized person knew was the most natural, sensible, and fair way of life ever devised. They turned, they fought, and they forced the startled Green Storm to a stalemate. Now, a broad ribbon of no-man’s-land wriggled across the Hunting Ground from the southern fringes of the Rustwater Marshes to the edges of the Ice Wastes, marking the boundary between two worlds. To the east of it the Green Storm was struggling to plant new static settlements and reclaim for their farmers land that had been plowed up and polluted by centuries of Municipal Darwinism. To the west, life went on almost as before, with cities hunting towns and towns hunting villages; the only difference was that most mayors sent a portion of their catch to feed the Traktionstadts. Over the years there had been all manner of battles as each side tried to break the line. Stretches of churned mud and empty marsh changed hands again and again, at the cost of thousands of lives, but always, when the months-long thunder of thrust and counterthrust had faded, the line remained much as it had been before, a river of dead ground winding across a continent.

"(The Dead Sea Scrolls)
1. Qumran: Qumran is best known as the place where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered not so long ago. The discoveries were made in caves located in the cliffs a mile or so west of the NW corner of the Dead Sea, at a place known by the modern Arabic name of Qumran. It is located between Jerusalem and the major Dead Sea beaches and other places like Ein Gedi and Masada. There are about 230 natural Qumran caves in the area and ten artificial caves and they are all spread over a large area. There are caves discovered, which were partly collapsed. Some natural caves went deeper then anyone had thought. It’s the be believed, that there are caves, not discovered yet, which connects several places together in the wilderness outside the caves. Remains dating back to the Iron Age have been uncovered at Qumran as well as walls, pottery and a cistern from later settlements.
2. The Essenes Jewish: Qumran was established during the Hellenistic Period c. 134-104 BC and remained inhabited up until c. 68 BC multilevel structures, reservoirs, pottery kilns and houses have been excavated in this era. It was during the Hellenistic Period that the Essenes Jewish sect settled here, isolating themselves from big city life and living as a communal monastery-like community. The community devoted itself to the study of the Bible. The life of the community was largely ascetic, and their practices included ritual bathing, sometimes referred to as baptism. The sect is thought to have eaten communal meals, studied sacred scriptures for most of the night, practice celibacy and they had their own calendar. From information found in the Dead Sea Scrolls scholars have managed to get a clear picture of the community’s way of life and beliefs. It is thought that about 200 people once lived here. In later periods of history there were Arab settlements here and during the Bar Kokhba Revolution the rebels may have taken refuge here.
The Essenes Jewish sect were the ones, who hid the Dead Sea scrolls in the caves, right before the arriving Roman armies who killed everyone.
3. The story behind the discovery: The Death Sea Scrolls were discovered in A.D. 1947, by a shepherd gazing his flock in a wadi at Qumran. As the story goes, a shepherd of the Ta’amireh tribe left his flock of sheep and goats to search for a stray. Amid the crumbling limestone cliffs that line the north-western rim of the Dead Sea, around the site of Qumran, he found a cave in the crevice of a steep rocky hillside. Intrigued, he cast a stone into the dark interior, only to be startled by the sound of breaking pots. Upon entering the cave, the young Bedouin found a mysterious collection of large clay jars. The majority were empty and upon examining the remaining few, he found that the jars were intact, with lids still in place. However, a closer look revealed nothing but old scrolls, some wrapped in linen and blackened with age. The boy had stumbled upon the greatest discovery of the century, the Dead Sea Scrolls.
4. Ancient manuscripts: This discovery brought to the attention of the scholarly world late that year and early in 1948. The most distinguished scholars called the find “phenomenal and sensational.”
The scrolls (biblical, deuterocanonical, and non-canonical) come from the last century B.C. and the first century A.D. At least 382 manuscripts are represented by the fragments of Cave Four alone, about 100 of which are biblical manuscripts. These include fragments of every book of the Hebrew Bible except Esther. Some of the books are represented in many copies. The documents, dated between 130 BC to AD 70, were fragments of a library which belonged to a Jewish monastic community.
Near the cliffs of the Dead Sea is the site of an ancient building known as the “Monastery,” which has yielded important data about the nature, size, and date of the Qumran community. From the sect’s literature we know that the people of Qumran were Jews who had split off from the Jerusalem (or main) stream of Judaism. A complete copy of Isaiah written in Hebrew was found and it was much older than any other known manuscripts. In all, 40,000 fragments were discovered and these have been reconstructed into over 500 books. About 100 of these are copies, with duplicates, of the Old Testament. In a general sense these underline and emphasize the accuracy of the documents we already have.
5. Importance of the discovery: The Dead Sea Scrolls proved that the Old Testament and the Hebrew Torah were true and independently confirmed! But there are mysteries too. We can only speculate about the scrolls which were destroyed when the caves collapsed and the scrolls which may never be discovered. There are caves ending somewhere in the surroundings of the Dead Sea, Masada and the Qumran caves. Those caves are long and go on for many kilometres. Some of them led to Jerusalem, others are unknown.
The discoveries of Qumran are important for biblical studies in general. In the matter of the text of the Old Testament, however, the Dead Sea Scrolls are of great importance. The text of the Greek Old Testament (or the Septuagint) as well as the quotations of the Old Testament in the New Testament, indicate that there were other texts besides the one that has come down to us (the Masoretic Text). In relation to the NT, the Dead Sea Scrolls furnish the background to the preaching of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ, as well as the writings of Paul and John.
Speaking on the reliability of the New Testament, F. F. Bruce said, “There is no body of ancient literature in the world which enjoys such a wealth of good textual attestation as the New Testament.",0.9746301770210266,1228,3.304079532623291

"Titanic is considered to be one of the most romantic movies ever made. You would not deny that. Many people consider it to be one of the greatest movies of all time. Even after more than two decades since its debut on the big screen, Titanic remains a truly unforgettable film. Everyone’s hearts were broken by the tragic love story of Jack and Rose. The movie won 11 Academy Awards because of James Cameron’s stunning filmmaking skills and Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet’s outstanding performances. With a major historical event as its backdrop, this 1997 blockbuster film combines drama, romance, action, and adventure.
There is more to Titanic than just a movie. There has not been an indelible memory than this one, a cultural touchstone that has not and probably will never be forgotten. Almost no movie can live up to the reputation of this one. However, there are many more touching stories like that of Jack and Rose which you should not miss. Here are some amazing movies similar to Titanic. Although none were as popular as Titanic, each is admirable and exceptional in its own way. Let us board the ship with some popcorn and tissues. We promise it is going to be a long, emotional ride.
Pro Tip: Make sure the internet connection does not make you grab some extra tissues with the screen freezing because you do not want that. If you are looking for reliable options, Spectrum Internet is a great one to look into. The rates are affordable and it gives you unlimited data usage.
Let us start with the movies list then.
Romeo and Juliet
There have been a million adaptations of William Shakespeare’s plays and stories to the big screen. This 1996 film explores Romeo and Juliet in a way few have seen before. Apart from modernizing the Shakespearean icons, Baz Luhrmann redesigned the story into an edgier, quirkier, contemporary California gang battle. However, love is not lost in the process. Romeo and Juliet are an endearing couple whose love story culminates in a tragic ending. Yes, just like Titanic.
You will not find a better romantic holiday movie than this one. This is one of the best movies of all time. As an anthology film, this English romance tells the story of dozens of love relationships between a bunch of characters tangentially intertwined. It is a blend of comedy and drama. As you watch the annual Christmas Nativity play, you will laugh, cry, and wonder how a lobster became a character. There is also an all-star cast to look forward to.
The focus of most romance films is ostensibly on two people falling in love. Many romance films have a recurring theme where the characters are able to live an authentic life through their relationships.
Carol and Therese are definitely like Rose and her story in Titanic. While the risks of following their hearts are enormous, the ambiguous ending at least implies that they are at least going to make it. The story takes place in the 1950s and tells the story of two closeted women who fall in love. That is all we are going to tell for now. You will have to watch the movie for the twist and fun.
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
What a beautiful, beautiful name for a film! Despite the fact that both films feature Kate Winslet, they take a different approach to falling in love than Titanic. It is also different from every other romance movie you have ever seen.
A couple decides to erase all memories of each other, only to realize that their attempts to escape the past were a mistake, even though their relationship was not as successful as expected. Love seems to be unbreakable; because once they meet again they appear to be engaged in another love journey.
The experience of falling in love is one of the most thrilling experiences in life, and Titanic masterfully captured that sensation. Blue Valentine also does a great job with capturing this beautiful emotion. It is true that there is nothing more relatable than realizing that the infatuation has passed, and there is nothing that can be done to salvage the euphoric feeling. It is a heart wrenching experience to watch the two lead characters come together only to eventually fall apart in this masterpiece.
That is all for our Titanic folks! We hope you enjoy watching all these movies just like you have enjoyed watching Titanic. If you also have movie suggestions for us, please let us know by commenting below.",0.9670549631118774,904,1.282275915145874
"Wedding photos are special, and if you find someone known to do it for you, things are move smoothly. A Redditor asked on a popular forum, Am I wrong for deleting my cousins precious wedding photos?
There is a lot that happened in the story, so here is it:
The Original Poster (OP) agreed to take wedding photos for his 26-year-old cousin Sarah’s wedding. She wanted OP to take photos of her getting ready, their grandmother putting a family heirloom necklace on her, the first look, the wedding, the reception, etc.
There was also another photographer who was a friend of the groom. He was taking photos of the groom and his side getting ready, and he was also taking photos at the wedding/reception. Since OP wasn’t a professional photographer by any means he told her that he would only charge $50 for the entire day.
And when he said entire day, he meant it.
From 8 am until 10 pm OP was with her taking photos and being harassed by her, her bridesmaids, and his aunt. She was a full-on bridezilla the entire time, not just to OP but to everyone including her husband. It was a long day.
So after all of that OP went home, edited the photos, and copied them onto individual USB drives for people she might want to give them to. OP texted Sarah a couple of days later to let her know that they were ready and that OP would happily meet up with her to exchange them for the $50.
She never responded. For the next three weeks OP texted, called, got in touch with her mother (OP’s aunt), and even stopped by her house to try and get the photos to her. She evaded every single attempt.
What Happened Next?
6 months passed since the wedding and OP was at the movies with his other 19-year-old cousin who was Sarah’s younger brother and a couple of their friends.
It was mentioned to OP that Sarah was wondering when he was going to give her the photos and that she was willing to pay $10 if that was the reason for the delay in communication. OP was shocked.
First, it was $50 and that was the deal from the start. OP told his cousin about that and asked to tell Sarah if she wanted them she needed to contact him within 2 days so they could meet up, with the payment, or he was going to delete them.
Sarah never contacted OP.
2 days passed, and OP deleted the photos and erased the USB drives. Less than a week later, OP’s aunt called, accusing him of threatening his cousin into paying when she supposedly did not have the money. OP explained that he tried to contact Sarah for over six months and that it was too late now because the photos were gone.
Some relatives, including OP’s aunt and uncle, refused to talk to OP or OP parents. OP’s mother believed OP should apologize, while OP’s older brother thought OP held onto the photos longer than necessary and should have deleted them after the first week of being ignored.
So OP asks, “Am I wrong for deleting my cousin’s wedding photos?”
Was OP correct to delete the photos? Was it inappropriate for OP’s cousin to keep evading him and then offer $10? How would you have reacted in this situation?

"Workplace Data Transfer FAQs
At Workplace, we're committed to your privacy and security, with world-class infrastructure and enterprise-grade security features designed to keep your Workplace community safe. We want to explain in more detail the commitments we make to our customers to keep their data safe and secure when it is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the US. We have therefore put together this FAQ for our customers to explain how and why we transfer data, as well as the protections we have in place when doing so.
Is Workplace data transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)?
Yes. In order to be able to provide the Workplace service, it is essential for us to be able to transfer data outside of the EEA and to utilise our global infrastructure. We do this in accordance with our Workplace Online Terms and specifically, the European Data Transfer Addendum. Workplace customer data processed by Meta Ireland will be transferred to countries outside the EEA, including the United States, for the purposes described in our Workplace Online Terms. These data transfers are necessary to operate and provide the Workplace service.
What mechanism does Workplace use to transfer data from the EU to the US?
From 7 September 2023, Meta will rely on the new Data Privacy Framework (DPF) for the transfer of Workplace customer data from the EU to the US. The DPF resolves a long-standing conflict of law between the EU and US, and means that we have the legal clarity to continue providing our services in Europe for the foreseeable future.
The DPF came into effect earlier this summer after the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision. It is a robust agreement that ensures the continued protection of Europeans’ data and renews legal safeguards for thousands of transatlantic companies that transfer data between Europe and the US. It ensures that vital digital connections between businesses on both sides of the Atlantic can continue uninterrupted.
What measures and safeguards have we put in place to protect Workplace data when it is transferred outside the EEA?
We have in place a number of safeguards and measures for Workplace data being transferred outside the EEA, including:
Meta maintains an Information Security Management System (ISMS) for Workplace. ISMS is put in place to establish, maintain and continuously improve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Workplace information assets and to ensure the trust of users using the Workplace platform. This has allowed Meta to maintain both ISO27001 and ISO27018 for Workplace, in addition to maintaining a SOC2 report and the robust technical safeguards outlined in the Data Security Addendum of the Workplace Online Terms. Becoming ISO27001 and ISO27018 compliant demonstrates Workplace is committed to protecting its operations and information from internal and external threats.
Encryption of data in transit so it cannot be read:
Meta employs industry standard encryption algorithms and protocols designed to secure and maintain the confidentiality of data in transit over public networks. Employing advanced encryption algorithms enables Meta to secure Workplace data in transit from access by third parties.
Operational policies and procedures:
We have robust policies and procedures in place to ensure Workplace data is adequately protected in relation to requests from governmental agencies. For example, we will only comply with a governmental request for Workplace user data after we are satisfied that the request complies with applicable law and our policies. If the request is unlawful (e.g. overly broad, or legally deficient in any way), we will push back or challenge the request. We encourage governmental agencies to submit only requests that are necessary, proportionate, specific, and strictly compliant with applicable laws, by publishing guidelines for government requests. More details about how we respond to government requests are provided in the Reviewing Government Requests FAQ.
No “back door” governmental access: We do not provide any government with direct access or encryption “back doors.” We believe that intentionally weakening our services in this way would undermine the security that is necessary to protect people who use our global service.
We have a dedicated, trained Law Enforcement Response Team (LERT) that reviews and evaluates every government request for user data individually, whether the request was submitted related to an emergency or through legal process obtained by law enforcement or national security authorities. This team ensures that all requests are consistent with applicable law and our policies.
Meta’s Transparency Report:
We publish information on government requests we receive in our Transparency Report. Information regarding requests made under the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) is included in the report with the maximum level of detail permitted under US law.
We appreciate the focus of governments across the globe on protecting and safeguarding people’s data, including in the US and Europe, and we work hard to do our part. We actively engage with governments to encourage practices that protect peoples’ rights. We belong to advocacy groups like Global Network Initiative, whose mission is to advance the freedom of expression and privacy rights of Internet users worldwide; and are a founding member of Reform Government Surveillance, which advocates for government data requests to be rule-bound, narrowly tailored, transparent, subject to strong oversight and protective of end-to-end encryption. We support surveillance reform and frequently engage with various government and regulatory bodies to advocate the same.
In addition to the rights under EU law and US law, individuals also have the right to submit a complaint or questions about Meta’s DPF certification through TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.
How does Meta handle law enforcement requests relating to Workplace?
Metas policy is to redirect government requesters to the Workplace customer in the first instance. If Meta is required to respond to a request for information relating to Workplace customer data, then this Government Requests FAQ sets out the policy and processes which will apply.
Meta scrutinizes every government request we receive, regardless of which government makes the request, to make sure it is legally valid. If we determine that a government request is not consistent with applicable law or our policies, we push back and engage the governmental agency to address any apparent deficiencies. If the request is unlawful (e.g. overly broad, or legally deficient in any way), we will challenge or reject the request. We encourage governmental entities to submit only requests that are necessary, proportionate, specific, and strictly compliant with applicable laws, by publishing guidelines for government requests.
We have robust policies to ensure every government request is scrutinized no matter which government makes the request. Meta must comply with valid and compulsory legal requests from US government agencies. These requests must be made in accordance with applicable law and our policies, and we produce only the information that is narrowly tailored to respond to each request.",0.9368749856948853,1377,1.4047504663467407

"As the outlook for the UK economy remains uncertain, UK business fears over potential insolvency appear to be easing.
While government data shows insolvencies are at a four-year high, research suggests that these figures are reaching their peak.
Wealth management and professional services group Evelyn Partners found that just under one in three businesses (32 per cent) acknowledged there is a risk they will become insolvent over the next 12 months.
This is considerably lower than in September 2022 when 47 per cent of firms believed there was a risk of insolvency.
According to the firm, businesses now seem to “be in a stronger position to weather this uncertainty and have rowed back from plans to batten down the hatches”.
Alternative means of funding
It also found that with traditional lender appetite suppressed, UK business owners are looking to alternative means of funding. Of the total capital UK businesses are looking to raise in the next six months, just 12 per cent of this funding will be from traditional banks.
More are turning to alternative means of funding, such as credit funds, where nine per cent of funding is set to be raised in the next six months.
‘Survival prospects have improved’
Claire Burden, partner at Evelyn Partners, said: “Businesses have weathered an exceptionally challenging winter, in which the cost of funding has soared, consumer confidence has taken a sizeable hit and energy prices have rocketed.
“Emerging out of these challenging months, it is encouraging that business confidence remains stable, and survival prospects have improved as businesses look ahead over the next year.
“Businesses are not out of the woods just yet, however. Although funding remains in ample supply, banking instability and interest rate rises have led to a buyers’ market. For borrowers and management teams this has resulted in more cumbersome financing processes.
“Businesses looking to re-finance or take on additional funding should therefore start the process early and enlist the support of specialist advisors to help identify funding options and the providers best aligned to their business needs.”

"When a Christian child was asked what she did when tempted to do wrong, she replied that she turned to the Lord Jesus, whom she had invited to dwell in her heart, and said:—
“There’s Satan at the door. Will You please go and answer the knock? And when Satan sees it’s Jesus, he knows it’s no use stopping, so he goes away.”
What a wise young Christian!
Satan still tempts us though we are Christians—he even tempted the Lord Jesus Himself! (Matthew 4:1-11). The enemy of our souls is stronger than we are, so do not let us try to fight him ourselves, but, like our young friend, ask the Lord to deal with him for us.

The Moon in Dutch Culture
There is a belief in Western culture that when looking up at the moon, the image of man can be seen. The Dutch household myth is, that the unhappy man was caught stealing vegetables. Dante calls him Cain:—
“… Now cloth Cain with fork of thorns confine,
On either hemisphere, touching the wave
Beneath the towers of Seville. Yesternight
The moon was round.”—Hell, cant. xx.
“… Tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots
Upon this body, which below on earth
Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?”

"Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, Murray Silverstein ~ 1977, Oxford University Press, New York.
In 1977, whilst in the UK the Sex Pistols where spreading a message of anarchy and being “Pretty Vacant”, in the USA Alexander, Ishikawa, Silverstein and co. were publishing three books that would enable us to bring order and thoughtful design to our homes, neighbourhoods, towns and cities. This, the second book in the series, is a working document for ‘a new traditional post-industrial architecture’.
The book takes the form of 253 patterns each pattern describes a problem that occurs in our built environment and then suggest ways to tackle that problem in a generic form, such that the application of the pattern to the problem will result in a unique and effective solution. The problems tackled range in scale, from number 1 the macro Independent Regions pattern that concerns itself with the size and nature of the largest autonomous congregations of people, through to pattern 253 things from your life a micro level pattern, that accentuates the need for the personalisation of our surroundings.
I can draw much from this book for my own project. The Secret Place pattern helps me to decide what to do in an awkward space between a bedroom and its en suite bathroom. The Six Foot Balcony pattern helps me plan a potential balcony and with reference to the pattern its usability should be ensured. Cooking Layout helps to derive the optimal kitchen design.
This is a pick-and-mix of a book, not all patterns will be of relevance to all projects, many are very high level, the first hundred or so are concerned with region, city, town & neighbourhood planning and so have minimal value to measly barn converters (although hopefully some relevance in planning shared spaces). Others betray the times in which they were written, Communal Sleeping, Dancing In The Street and Sleeping In Public evoking the more innocent, hopeful hippy-dippy 1970’s.
Having said that, despite its 30 year vintage, this book remains a thought provoking tome that is an essential reference resource for anyone designing or thinking of designing a building.",0.9330852627754211,434,1.3587077856063843
"Are we heading for a global trade war?
The global economy has still not fully recovered from the financial crisis, and it could be under threat again.
President Trump was elected with a mandate to make America great again – especially in terms of industry. The great industrial cities of the Midwest have become the ‘Rust Belt’ in decline since the 1980s, when traditional manufacturing work started to be lost to foreign competitors. China and the emerging economies had low labour costs and manufacturing plants based on new technology, which allowed them to undercut US industry.
American manufacturers have actually relocated to China to take advantage of the cheaper labour costs. “Made in USA” imprints are becoming a rarity.
The first shots have been fired
As part of a stated policy to bring jobs back to America, the Trump administration imposed a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods imported into the United States on June 15.
However, the very next day, June 16, 2018, China announced a retaliatory 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of American exports to China.
It looks as though the first shots have been fired a trade war between the US and China. But the fighting may not be restricted to the Pacific theatre. President Trump hit EU, Canadian and Mexican metal producers with tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium at the start of June. Last Friday, the EU reacted with retaliatory import tariffs on a range of American products. Everything with a made in the USA tag from orange juice and blue jeans to that Harley Davidson you always promised yourself will cost you more as a result.
An initial €2.8 billion (£2.5bn) in charges could be just the beginning. The pattern of Mr Trump reintroducing protectionism and other countries predictably hitting back could risk escalating into an all-out trade war between the US and the rest of the world.
We know where protectionism leads…
President Trump seems to be following a policy of Protectionism, the economic policy of restricting imports from other countries through methods such as tariffs on imported goods. Protectionist policies shield the businesses and workers of the importing country from foreign competitors. However, they also reduce trade and raise the cost of imported goods.
There is a consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth, and some believe it to be the cause of the great depression of the 1930s. Stock markets around the world may have seen falls sparked by fears of a protectionist trade war.
Germany has slashed its economic forecasts. OPEC is worried. China may already be slowing, emerging markets are coming under pressure and the International Monetary Fund is sounding the alarm.
But are things quite so simple?
A trade war could slow global trade, which would lead to the US killing off the growth it needs to bring back jobs to the rustbelt. President Trump can’t afford to undermine growth and jobs in the United States, cutting the US out of international trade, while other blocks take advantage of free trade elsewhere. Or it could simply be a political move, rather than an economic strategy, a tactic designed to soften up trading partners for some of the much-vaunted Trump deal making in the near future.
Whether the threat is real or not, if your investments include international stock, you might want to consider your position with volatile markets in mind.
The value of investments can fall as well as rise and you may get back less than you invested.

"Crafting a Winning CV as a Student with No Experience
As a student, transitioning from academia to the professional world can be daunting. One of the first steps in this journey is creating a compelling Curriculum Vitae (CV). Even without a wealth of professional experience, you can craft a CV that showcases your skills, potential, and dedication. Here’s a guide to help you create a standout CV:
1. Understand the Purpose of a CV
A CV is a comprehensive document that details your education, skills, experiences, and achievements. It serves as a marketing tool to introduce yourself to potential employers. Unlike a resume, which is often tailored to specific job applications, a CV provides a broader overview of your qualifications.
2. Choose a Suitable CV Format
While there are various CV formats, the most common for students are:
- Chronological: This format lists your experiences in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent. It's ideal for students with a clear timeline of academic achievements.
- Functional: This format highlights your skills and experiences, rather than focusing on chronological order. It's beneficial for students with gaps in their work history or who want to emphasize transferable skills.
- Combination: This format combines elements of both chronological and functional formats, allowing you to showcase your most relevant experiences while providing a clear timeline.
3. Start with a Strong Contact Information Section
Place your name, email address, phone number, and a professional-looking LinkedIn profile link at the top of your CV. Consider including a personal website or portfolio if you have one.
4. Create a Compelling Summary or Objective Statement
This brief introduction should highlight your key skills, career goals, and what you can offer employers. For example:
- Summary: “Highly motivated student with a passion for [field of study]. Seeking an entry-level position to leverage strong [skills] and academic achievements in a dynamic work environment.”
- Objective: “To secure an internship in [field] to gain practical experience and apply theoretical knowledge while contributing to a collaborative team.”
5. Document Your Education
List all your education institutions that you have attended, degrees, majors, minors, and date of graduation, as well as relevant coursework and honors or awards that you received. You should include in this list your graduation date and expected graduation date if you are still studying for your degree.
6. Demonstrate Your Skills
Divide your skills section into two subcategories: Hard skills (technical abilities, e.g., software proficiency or languages) and Soft skills (interpersonal qualities, e.g., communication, teamwork, and problem-solving). Where possible, you should use numbers and percentages to quantify the skills you have for example, ""Proficient with Microsoft Office Suite with advanced use of Excel"").
7. Leverage Experiences
Even though you may not have any traditional work experience, relevant activities and experiences are to be a highlight. This might include, but not limited to:
- Part-time employment: List part-time employment, internships, volunteer work.
- Academic projects: State group projects with detailed descriptions of research papers and presentations.
- Extracurricular activities: Define clubs, organizations, or sports teams you have been a part of.
- Certifications: List any certification or licenses.
- Describe experiences using the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result. Example :
- Situation: ""Being a project leader in a group project, I coordinated a group of five students.""
- Task: ""Develop a mobile application for a local charity.""
- Action: ""Making a full timeline of the task and delegating appropriately to meet the deadlines, utilizing skills in project management""
- Result: ""We launched an app; to our surprise, it crossed all the expectations we had set for raising money.""
8. Customize Your Resume to Every Job Application
While your CV provides the overall synopsis of your qualifications, you need to tailor it to the specific application. Research the company and position, then pull out the skills and experiences most directly applicable to the job.
9. Thorough Proofreading
While a typos and small errors will not generally make a difference, they can have a negative impact on an application. Take the time to review your CV for all types of errors. Have a friend or mentor also review your CV for errors and oversights.
10. Keep It Concise
Aim for a CV that is one to two pages long. While it's important to include relevant information, avoid redundancy and unnecessary details.
Remember, your CV is your first impression on potential employers. By following these guidelines and showcasing your skills and potential, you can create a compelling CV that helps you stand out in the competitive job market.",0.9163820743560791,990,2.0880446434020996
"- Dollar tries to recover as Fedspeak favors further cuts
- China announces new measures, positive initial market reaction
- Aussie benefits from another hawkish RBA meeting
- Gold, oil and pound rallies continue
Debate for the next Fed cut intensifies
US stocks remain in a positive mood as Fed speakers continue to advocate for further rate cuts, despite the fact that the US data confirm the strength of the US economy. Although the first Fed rate cut was almost unanimously approved, there seems to be a lack of cohesion regarding the size of the next step.
The doves are in favour of further aggressive cuts, but the hawks are supporting a more measured approach, with one eye on the US election. Interestingly, Fed board member Bowman, the lone dissenter at last week’s Fed meeting, will be on the wires later today, ahead of the important consumer confidence indicator.
Fed board member Bowman, the lone dissenter at last week’s Fed meeting, will be on the wires later today
On Monday, the US dollar managed to recoup a small part of its recent losses by taking advantage of the abysmal preliminary PMI surveys in the euro area and the negative newsflow from Germany. Oddly, the market continues to price in 75 bps of Fed easing in 2024, but only 50 bps of rate cuts by the ECB. This looks surprising considering the economic outlook of these two regions.China announces further support measures
An array of new measures has been announced by the PBoC and the Chinese administration. Following Monday’s strong cash injection of around $33bn, the reserve requirement ratio will be cut by 50 bps and the 7-day repo will drop to 1.5% from 1.7%.
In addition, the MLF rate, which is the rate at which banks borrow from the PBoC for up to 1 year, will be lowered by 0.3% and the LPR, the 5-year benchmark for mortgage rates, will drop by 0.25%. Further measures were also announced in a desperate attempt by the Chinese authorities to turn the tide in the housing sector.
The interesting factor is that the PBoC did not announce the implementation date of the new measures, as they probably wish to evaluate the market reaction. Chinese stocks have reacted positively to the news with the Shanghai composite index rising around 4%, led by property sector stocks. However, the initial market moves might be misleading, as the market will be anxiously looking for a rebound in house prices in order to accept the effectiveness of the new measures.
Chinese stocks have reacted positively to the news with the Shanghai composite index rising around 4%, led by property sector stocks.
RBA remains hawkish
In the meantime, the Reserve Bank of Australia maintained its relatively hawkish stance, as it continues to be displeased about the inflation outlook and the elevated underlying inflation. Taking into account the positive newsflow from China and the possibility of a strong pickup in economic activity there, expectations for an RBA rate cut by year-end could be further dented.
Aussie/dollar reacted positively to the headlines, and it tested the December 28, 2023 high of 0.6870, but it is gradually surrendering part of its gains as RBA Governor Bullock commented that they did not consider a rate hike at the meeting.Gold, oil and pound benefit
Amidst these conditions, gold, oil and the pound continue to record gains. Both gold and oil are taking advantage of the dollar’s recent weakness and the latest developments in the Middle East, where Israel is rumoured to be preparing for a ground operation in Lebanon.
Amidst these conditions, gold, oil and the pound continue to record gains.
Similarly, earlier today the euro/pound pair reached the lowest level since April 2022, and pound/dollar traded at a new 30-month high. Understandably, some profit has since taken place, supported by BoE Governor Bailey’s comment at a regional newspaper that rates will come down gradually.

"When the weather dips below -15C (5F), a beautiful natural phenomenon can occur, producing a fractal flourish of ice known as “frost flowers.” These delicate blooms are made entirely of ice crystals that grow in patches around three to four centimeters in diameter. They are specific to thin lake ice in calm weather conditions, and they form in a branching, tree-like pattern that mimics a rose or petal. When present, the frost flowers transform the landscape into an ethereal wonderland.
The ice blooms seen here are located in Hokkaido, Japan on Lake Akan. Its conditions are just right for these crystalline structures to exist–a mountain blocks the wind so the scenery is peaceful. When looking at the meadow of frost flowers, you might feel the same tranquility needed for them to thrive.

"The Need for Immigration Reform
Immigration has always been a major topic of debate in the United States. America’s history is deeply rooted in immigration, and it’s one of the reasons why it has always been considered a “melting pot” of cultures. Unfortunately, the current immigration system is not without its share of problems. The US immigration system has been heavily criticized for its complexities, bureaucracy, and difficulty in obtaining legal status. Additionally, the lack of immigration reforms in the country has only exacerbated these issues, leading to a significant backlog in immigration cases and a rise in undocumented immigrants. The need for immigration reform has become even more urgent in recent times, with the Covid-19 pandemic highlighting the critical role that immigrants play in essential industries such as healthcare, agriculture, and food processing.
The Dreamers and DACA Program
The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was created in 2012 to protect undocumented immigrants who had been brought into the country as minors. These individuals, often referred to as “Dreamers” had been living in the shadows because of their undocumented status, and the program was put in place to allow them to work and live in the United States without fear of deportation. However, in 2017, the Trump administration moved to phase out the DACA program, causing a legal battle that eventually reached the Supreme Court. In June 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could not end the DACA program, bringing relief to more than 650,000 Dreamers currently enrolled in the program. However, the future of the program remains unclear, and it has become a hot-button issue in the ongoing immigration reform debate.
The Impact of Covid-19 on Immigration
The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the world, and the immigration system has not been spared. The pandemic has led to the shutdown of embassies and consulates around the world, causing a backlog in visa processing and leaving many individuals stranded. In addition, the Trump administration used the pandemic as an excuse to further restrict immigration, including suspending visas for certain types of workers, such as H-1B visas for highly skilled workers. In contrast, the Biden administration has reversed some of these policies, such as ending the ban on visas for Muslim-majority countries and lifting restrictions on foreign workers in certain industries. However, the pandemic has created long-lasting issues that will need to be addressed in future immigration reforms.
Congressional Action on Immigration Reform
The current administration has consistently pushed for comprehensive immigration reform, which includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, reform of the legal immigration system, and border security measures. In 2021, the Biden administration unveiled the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, a sweeping immigration reform bill that includes provisions for Dreamers, temporary protected status (TPS) holders, and essential workers. The bill also includes measures to address irregular migration in Central America and provide more funding for technology, infrastructure, and staffing at the border. While the bill is a significant step towards reforming the immigration system, it still faces an uphill battle in Congress, where Democrats hold a slim majority in both houses.
The Future of US Immigration Reform
Immigration reform has always been a difficult issue to address in the United States, and it’s likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. The Biden administration has expressed a commitment to push for immigration reform, but with a divided Congress, it remains to be seen what reforms will ultimately come to fruition. In the meantime, millions of immigrants in the United States continue to navigate a complex and often hostile immigration system, hoping that someday they will receive the fair and just treatment that they deserve.

"I always feel wolves were a bit under-powered (wolf bite is 400 PSI), so this is my take on them... bigger wolf too.
Wolves are most active at night but can be roused to activity during the day. Hunting expeditions are highly co-ordinated affairs.
A pack chooses and stalks its prey carefully and attacks, when they happen, consist of successive waves of between three and six animals aiming to incapacitate the prey before tearing out the throat or cutting off air at the windpipe. The alpha male feeds first, followed by the remainder of the pack in an established order. The youngest members of a pack may have to make do with scraps.
In combat wolves rely on their powerful bite rather than their claws. Once a bite takes hold the wolf locks its jaws, and continues to exert pressure through the canines and by vigorously shaking the head, deepening and lengthening the bites. Wolves therefore tend to choose the Grip and Choose Location Special Effects (always aiming for an exposed area). A Gripped victim sustains biting damage throughout the duration of the grip as the wolf worries at the wound.
If the alpha male is forced to flee then the pack follows suit, although braver individuals may attempt to gain status by remaining to fight. |",0.9697290062904358,259,2.5310046672821045

"Rivals national recruiting director Adam Gorney has a trio of predictions on five-star quarterbacks Julian Lewis and Bryce Underwood and whether we’re making a mistake by not having a five-star tight end in the 2025 class.
MORE PREDICTIONS: Michael Fasusi, Tennessee, South Carolina
MORE GORNEY: Biggest recruiting visits on tap this weekend
CLASS OF 2027 RANKINGS: Top 100
1. IF JULIAN LEWIS FLIPS, IT WON'T BE TO COLORADO OR INDIANA.
This prediction is coming a little out of left field although there are some rumors floating around that other programs could be trying to get involved with Julian Lewis, who has been committed to USC for more than a year.
Here’s the situation as it stands now: The five-star quarterback from Carrollton, Ga., remains pledged to the Trojans but Indiana and Colorado have been trying to flip him for months. Georgia, Auburn and others have been involved throughout his recruitment as well.
Colorado is intriguing for a number of reasons from coach Deion Sanders’ success during his second year with the program, to playing for offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur, who has NFL experience, and the opportunity to take over for Shedeur Sanders, an expected first-round NFL Draft pick.
There are also some concerns. What will the offense look like with Sanders and Travis Hunter, another first-round selection, gone? How engaged will Sanders be with the Buffaloes if another job – maybe an SEC one – opens up, especially with his two sons and Hunter gone?
Indiana seemed like an absurd long shot before the season but there continues to be interest there. First-year coach Curt Cignetti is pulling off a miracle in Bloomington. Lewis has known position coach Tino Sunseri since the five-star was a kid and Sunseri was at Florida State.
But is there enough of an NIL market in Bloomington? Can this success be sustained in the Big Ten over the long term? How would all that work not playing in a big media market or a traditional powerhouse program?
And then there’s USC. The season has been a disappointment but coach Lincoln Riley has coached numerous Heisman Trophy winners and No. 1 picks. That remains a massive draw.
There are other programs still working and scheming for a quarterback in this class and the final weeks before signing day could be really interesting. For Lewis, there might still be a lot to figure out in the final days.
2. THIS WEEKEND WILL DETERMINE EVERYTHING FOR BRYCE UNDERWOOD.
The situation is pretty clear for five-star quarterback Bryce Underwood: Stick with his LSU commitment that he made in January or flip to Michigan, which has put together a hefty NIL package and clearly needs to fix its massive quarterback hole.
The Wolverines have had all the perceived momentum in recent weeks especially as it’s been reported that Michigan coach Sherrone Moore is now even more personally involved in getting the Belleville, Mich., standout to flip.
Chatter ramped up even more after four-star LSU receiver commit Derek Meadows visited with the Wolverines last weekend and is expected at Notre Dame on Saturday. Four-star Michigan quarterback commit Carter Smith backed off his longstanding pledge in recent days.
Is this all a coincidence or is Michigan now in a really good spot with Underwood?
We should have a much clearer picture after this weekend since the five-star standout is expected back in Baton Rouge for the showdown against Alabama. His relationship with position coach Joe Sloan is very strong so if Underwood gets any hint or inclination Sloan could be in line for the East Carolina job or any other spot that could make things more interesting.
The good news for LSU was there was no immediate flip to Michigan once that side proposed the NIL situation and how he could be used in that offense. There was always marginal interest in the Wolverines throughout his recruitment.
The environment in Baton Rouge should be incredible this weekend. Underwood will be there. Michigan is making a push but this is LSU’s chance to lock up the five-star once and for all.
3. WE WILL REGRET HAVING NO FIVE-STAR TIGHT ENDS IN THE 2025 RIVALS250.
Without getting too deep in the numbers, there is usually one tight end taken in the first round of the NFL Draft so our rankings should not only consider that but reflect it with one five-star in most classes, give or take. Some years there will be a few, some years none if we don’t really love the class.
We really love this tight end group, yet we still haven’t pulled the trigger on a five-star tight end. That looks like a mistake to me with only one rankings cycle left after the all-star events over the holidays.
Georgia commit Elyiss Williams is No. 1 so he’d be the leading contender but there definitely has to be a discussion around Kansas State pledge Linkon Cure, Tennessee pledge DaSaahn Brame and possibly others.
This is a loaded tight end group. One is usually taken in the first round. At least one five-star should be among the position and right now it’s a mistake that we don’t have one.",0.9602389931678772,1105,0.9209121465682983

"If you are looking for work in Canada, the LMIA program can be a great way to get started. This program allows Canadian employers to hire foreign nationals to fill jobs that cannot be filled by Canadians, or Permanent Residents (PR). If you are interested in applying for this program, there are a few things you need to know. In this blog post, we will discuss the basics of the LMIA program and how to start your job search!
Do You Need A Permit To Work In Canada?
If you are a foreign national hoping to work in Canada, you will need a work permit, in most cases. If you are found to be working without a proper permit, you may be subject to removal from the country. In some cases, you may also be fined or imprisoned. There are a few exceptions to this rule, such as if you are working on a film or television production, performing in a concert, or participating in an exchange program. If you are a student in Canada on a study permit, you are permitted to work while you are in the country without applying for a separate work permit. However, if your study is completed and you want to work in the country, you will need to apply for a post-graduation work permit (PGWP).
If you are unsure whether or not you need a work permit, you can contact Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for more information.
In order to apply for a work permit, you will need a job offer from a Canadian employer and in most cases, the employer will also need to obtain a positive Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) before you can apply for a work permit.
How Does The LMIA Program Work?
The LMIA is used to assess the impact that hiring a foreign worker will have on the Canadian labor market. If the LMIA is approved, the employer will then send you a copy of the LMIA along with your job offer. You will need to submit this documentation when you apply for your work permit.
There are some exceptions to this rule. If you come from a country in the International Experience Class, you can apply for a job without having an LMIA first. You can find the list of countries on IRCC website.
It is important to note that the LMIA program is not open to all employers. Only those who have made an effort to hire Canadians but have been unable to find qualified candidates will be considered for the program. In addition, the employer must be able to provide evidence that the foreign worker will be paid a salary that is comparable to Canadian workers in the same occupation.
The first step in applying for the LMIA program is to find a job that interests you. Once you have found an employer who is willing to hire you, they will need to obtain a positive LMIA from ESDC. The employer will then send you a copy of the LMIA along with your job offer so you can apply for your work permit.
How To Start Your Job Search
In order to get a LMIA, you first need to find a job that cannot be filled by Canadians. The best way to do this is to look at the Canada Occupation in Demand List. This is a list of the jobs that have the most employee shortages right now. If you have good experience in one of these roles, you may be able to apply for a position and the employer can then apply for an LMIA.
However, if you don’t have the experience in these areas or there are other suitable local candidates, you may struggle. That doesn’t mean you cannot find a job by other means though. Consider your experience and qualifications and start searching for jobs by other means. You can use job sites like the Canadian government job bank or even contact companies directly. Many companies will advertise the jobs as LMIA jobs because they have already advertised to Canadian citizens and failed to find a suitable candidate.
When looking at jobs, you need to consider the NOC (National Occupation Classification) code. This is a four-digit code that corresponds to the skill level and pay bracket of the job. Looking for high-skilled jobs will increase the likelihood of your work permit being accepted, but you will need more qualifications and experience to apply for these positions.
If you follow this process, you should be able to find a job and get an LMIA so you can apply for your work permit.

Several countries have reported faulty or contaminated equipment from China to combat the deadly coronavirus which also originated in China.
A range of products have been delivered to countries overwhelmed by the global Covid-19 pandemic from China.
However, the gesture and goods haven’t quite passed the bar in some cases.
Yesterday, Australian officials reportedly seized facemasks exported from China to help combat the spread of the virus.
The Australian Border Force seized around 800,000 defective facemasks worth around $12m AUD.
National File recently reported on a viral video of a Chinese factory worker snickering as he rubbed facemasks on his shoe.
The UK reported of Covid-19 testing kits sent from China found to be contaminated with the coronavirus when they were being surveyed by a Luxembourg-based company.
The delivery of the kits were delayed by the contamination.
Last week, Spain returned faulty Covid-19 testing kits after the Spanish government bought the kits from an unauthorized Chinese company.
The first batch, of around 9,000 kits, found that only 30% tested the patients for the virus with reliable accuracy–even though an 80% level of accuracy was expected, according to the New York Times.
The head of Spain’s public health emergency department Fernando Simon said: “Spain obtained several providers and supply routes. The first one sent a batch of 9,000 tests that were validated at the National Center of Epidemiology and some hospitals (in Madrid).
“The specifications of the batch did not match up with the certification of quality that came with it, which meant they had to be returned and the company will change them.”
The Netherlands was forced to recall around 600,000 China-made masks as they failed to meet specifications. The Czech Republic also reportedly returned sub-par Chinese equipment–some of which was diverted from Italy–designed to help battle the pandemic.
China has struggled to meet standards as they scramble to reach global demand for protective, medical equipment to help stifle the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
Over 900,000 people worldwide have tested positive for the coronavirus, with more than 46,000 deaths recorded.",0.976352334022522,460,2.3419628143310547
"Here's What You Need To Remember: China continues to acquire Russian jets, though this is largely in order to acquire technologies in the latest versions of the Flanker, the Su-35. China acquired these aircraft in December 2015. Supposedly, the primary item of interest is the improved engines in these aircraft, following China’s failure to get a license to produce that specific part and its own difficulties in producing clones of the original Su-27SK engines for the J-11.
The Sukhoi Su-27 “Flanker” was never planned to exported when it was originally developed, unlike its lighter cousin, the MiG-29. However, ever since being approved for export it has been one of the most popular fighter exports in the Asian region. The first customer for the Su-27 was China, which secured a procurement deal while the Soviet Union still existed. But how did Beijing accomplish this?
The beginning of the Su-27’s export success began with the Sino-Soviet thaw in 1989. During Gorbachev’s visit to China in May 1989, motions were made to reopen Sino-Soviet military trade. This was followed by an interview published in a magazine in September 1989 that stated that there would be no political obstacle to China acquiring MiG-29 fighter aircraft. In May 1990, a Chinese delegation visited the Soviet Union to discuss the acquisition of advanced aircraft. This delegation saw demonstrations of the MiG-29, Su-27 and various helicopters.
The Soviet handlers attempted to push the MiG-29 onto the Chinese delegation, pointing at the long history of Chinese adoption and adaptation of MiG aircraft. However, after seeing the demonstrations, the Chinese delegation wanted the Su-27. Reasons cited were the larger combat radius of the Su-27, the advanced fly-by-wire system (compared to the MiG-29’s simple hydraulic controls) and the superior performance of the engines in the Su-27 in both raw power and operational life. This would provide the best platform on which future upgrades could be built, a modern “base” on which the next generation of Chinese tactical aircraft would draw from.

Given the significant Chinese modernization and upgrade programs for the MiG-21 (J-7 in Chinese service) that were necessitated by the long Sino-Soviet split, the Chinese industrial base has had significant experience modifying and improving Soviet designs. Chinese leadership probably felt that the Sukhoi’s superlative aerodynamic capabilities and large airframe made it the most suitable for such experimentation and upgrades, compared to the MiG. While the Soviets resisted, the economic troubles of that era probably lead them to greenlight the Chinese procurement of the Su-27. Chinese sources point more to a spirit of brotherly cooperation and a need to make amends following the long period of chilly relations, but an economic incentive seems more likely.
Following negotiations in the winter of 1990, China signed an agreement to purchase twenty-four Su-27SK and Su-27UBK (K indicating Kitai, meaning China) fighters. Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, President Boris Yeltsin continued to honor this arrangement, and the first fighters were delivered on June 27, 1992.
But this was not enough for China. Realizing the dire economic straits Russia faced in the 1990s, they pushed for technology transfer of the Su-27, including the full production line. This, too, was agreed on in 1995. China then began licensed production of the Su-27 as the J-11.
This strategy appears to have paid off in spades for China, as apparently one of the original goals of the Su-27 adoption was to have an advanced “chassis” on which Chinese technology could be adopted and developed. We can see this in spades in the myriad of versions of the J-11 China has put out in recent years. The J-11B features AESA radars, composite components, Chinese glass cockpits and Chinese engines. The J-16D represents a Chinese attempt to make an EW aircraft similar to the EA-18G “Growler.” Unlike India, which opened the MMRCA program to find a multirole fighter aircraft because it deemed its Su-30MKIs as incapable of being true multiroles, the J-11 can employ a wide variety of Chinese ground-attack munitions, including Chinese versions of the American Small Diameter Bomb. Russian equipment has been steadily replaced, from the oxygen generators to the radar warning receivers.
Despite these advances, China continues to acquire Russian jets, though this is largely in order to acquire technologies in the latest versions of the Flanker, the Su-35. China acquired these aircraft in December 2015. Supposedly, the primary item of interest is the improved engines in these aircraft, following China’s failure to get a license to produce that specific part and its own difficulties in producing clones of the original Su-27SK engines for the J-11. Regardless, the reasons for China’s adoption of the Su-27 stand: Beijing wanted the top-performing fighter with the best technology from which it could learn, and got it.

"The England Hypothesis: The Real Reason Behind the Autism Pandemic
What you are about to read is so shocking, disturbing and counter-intuitive that you will want to turn away from even the possibility that I am right. I urge you, for the sake of yourself and your family, to consider what I am presenting before rejecting it.
The England Hypothesis, named for its brilliant creator, Christina England, herself a mother of two adults severely injured by vaccines, is important enough to change our world. If I am correct and the England Hypothesis is accurate, it already is changing our world in unimaginable and horrifying ways – and no one noticed until Christina saw the pattern last week!
She shared it with me and the other Trustees of the Natural Solutions Foundation. We believe she has hit the nail on the head. Read on. Your world will never be the same.
No one would wish an autistic child on his/her family. No one could harm a child intentionally to that extent. No one wants to see minds and lives destroyed. Right?
Wrong, according to the England Hypothesis.
Widget not in any sidebars
According to the England Hypothesis, vaccine injury-induced autism is an intentional chemical manipulation used to create millions of worker drones – sterile, docile, unable to question the conditions handed to them for their lives, content with boring, repetitive tasks, placid, disposable and interchangeable. In short, autists are the ‘deltas’ and ‘epsilons’ of the brave New World Order toward which we are being herded through intentional social, political and genetic manipulation consistent with the genocidal aspirations of the globalists and their horrifying Agenda 21.
A moment of historical perspective is in order, since this has been in the works for a very long time.
Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World was published in 1932. In that dystopian view of our future, babies were created to serve the state, raised in Hatcheries and Conditioning Centers, where they are divided into five castes, each designed to fulfill predetermined positions within the social and economic strata of the World State. Fetuses chosen to become members of the highest castes, ‘Alpha’ and ‘Beta’, are allowed to develop naturally while maturing to term in “decanting bottles”. Fetuses chosen to become members of the lower castes (‘Gamma’, ‘Delta’, ‘Epsilon’) are subjected to carefully designed specific chemical interference to cause arrested development in intelligence or physical growth.
High cast members are individuals since each ‘Alpha’ or ‘Beta’ is the product of one unique fertilized egg developing into one unique fetus. Members of lower castes are not unique but are interchangeable and disposable drones since large numbers are spawned from a single ovum.
We do not yet have decanting bottles and hatcheries in which to produce Genetically Modified babies. In our world, 2013, they are created with syringes. They are not called deltas and epsilons. They are called autistic people.
The England Hypothesis suddenly explains – and predicts, as any good hypothesis should – the otherwise inexplicable and currently mysterious.
It makes total sense out of the totally unscientific and irrational vigor with which world bodies support increasing numbers of highly toxic vaccines for every child, even before they are born, knowing full well that these children will be damaged – chemically altered – forever, but denying it with insane fervor. It also makes total sense out of the vicious and illogical attacks on those who call vaccines out for what they are: syringes of death, inefficient, inexact, illegal, uninsurable, disastrously dangerous and scientifically unsupported practice of vaccination.
Those who survive somewhat intact are intended for the bottom tier of the labor pool – the technicians and working prols keeping the Neo-Aristocrats clean, fed, mobile and entertained.
Some autistic people are employable. Some are not. But the ones who are are make perfect technoids: happy with routine tasks, happy with predictable, controlled environments and lives, happy with limited aspirations and capable of docile, life-long passivity if their routine needs are met, eager to please and sometimes very good at highly linear tasks like programing.
So autism, we realize, thanks to the brilliant insight of our Dr. Rima Reports guest this week, Christina England (mother of two autistic vaccine injured adults) is a useful trait induced in a large number of children for their technician classes.
Let’s test this horrifying hypothesis against the known facts, shall we? Goldman Sachs this week announced the funding of a program to hire the autistic. The links at the end of this article take you to just a few of the programs now receiving funding and plaudits from globalists like Goldman Sachs and Bill Gates.
As Lord David Freud, a Member of the House of Lords, said in his speech on March 20, 2012,
…it makes good business sense to employ people who are reliable, punctual and loyal; people who have good attention to detail and concentration levels; people who have excellent problem solving skills and can be analytical, resourceful and creative. What good employer wouldn’t want an employee with those skills?
Indeed, what good employer would not? But what lengths would that good employer and his friends go to in order to make sure that there were plenty of people in that pool, plenty of deltas and plenty of epsilons?
The length of a syringe, perhaps. The England Hypothesis, to which I subscribe, says they would – and, horrifyingly, do. Millions and millions of times per day, all over the world.
Fox News reports that SAP, a huge German company which employs 65,000 programmers world-wide now want 10% of their programmers to be autistic persons. Justifying their interest in autistic programmers, Fox tells us “The multinationals both say they hope to harness the unique talents of autistic people as well as giving people previously marginalized in the workforce a chance to flourish in a job.”
How nice. What about people with Spinal Bifida? Parkinson’s Disease? Cerebral Palsy, flipper limbs? harelip?
The propaganda is flowing, now that vaccine injured persons are reaching marketable age.
An article lauding a Goldman Sachs program to hire autistic persons says,
He is part of the most visible generation of young people with autism our society has ever known. Diagnosed early, this generation have been educated to expect not just a job when they leave school but a career on a par with their ‘neuro-typical’ contemporaries.
‘Neuro-typical’ sounds like Brave New World Order speak for Alphas and Betas.
The THIRD is to take this Action Item, http://tinyurl.com/VaccineRefuser, telling your decision makers that you absolutely reject forced vaccination or other drugging now and forever for every one of your family members and then commit to motivating at least 10 others to do the same and motivate 10 more, etc. Mass resistance is fertile, not futile.
And the FOURTH is to become an advocate for vaccine truth. Tell your friends, neighbors, church members, relatives, people in the supermarket checkout line, playground parents, co-workers, that you do not support vaccination and that you are a vaccine refuser as I am.
In fact, I invite you personally to send me a less than 1 minute video telling me why you are a vaccine refuser. Email it to me at [email protected]. We’ll create a Vaccine Refuser’s Wall of Fame and you’ll be there along with me.
Ultimately, vaccination is perhaps the clearest issue of health freedom or slavery.
Either you own your body and control what goes into it or you do not. Either you are a free person or one whose body belongs to someone else.
Either you control your genetic matrix or someone else has the right to alter it for their purposes.

"It is indeed difficult to get back the children into following the regular school schedule from the lazy summer holiday schedule.
Most often, children stay up late to watch TV during summer, and also end up doing everything else that they want to. Generally, it takes about a month to get them back into a routine, and you are likely to face some challenges. Here is a checklist that has been put together help you to make a smooth transition into starting the regular school routine for your children.
The most important point that needs mention is the time that you have to give both yourself and the children: the time required by you to set up a new schedule and the time required by the children to fall into the new bedtimes and waking-up schedules.
Plan in Advance: As an adult you may need up to two weeks to adjust to a new schedule. Give yourself this time allowance; your children may take a little longer to adjust.
Fix Their Sleep Hygiene: The summer heat can linger for a good few weeks after the holidays have finished, meaning your kid’s rooms might be too hot for them. During school time, this can be a problem because they need to be well-rested, so try visiting an HVAC website to get air conditioning fitted throughout your house. This will bring the nighttime temperature down, making it easier for everyone to sleep.
Fix YOUR Sleep Hygiene: It is essential that you take care of your child’s sleep health, but you must also be aware of your own so you can benefit as well. You’re not the only one who has changed due to a different summer schedule. If you suffer from sleep issues such as insomnia or sleep apnea, then you know how difficult sleep can be, which is why you need to take charge because how can you look after your children if you can’t look after yourself? If you are wondering “what is the best cpap mask?” or “how can I improve my sleep quality?” Then you are in luck as sites such as cpaponline.com.au are here to help.
Rise Early: In the final fortnight before the school reopens, advance your alarm clock by a specific amount of time. Ensure that you wake up at this time and you can further advance the alarm clock by 15 minutes at regular intervals to make a smoother transition.
Go to Bed Early: It is a good idea to get your children to go to bed early as well. You can manage a smoother transition and save yourself a few heated exchanges by promising a treat in return for getting into bed early. To make their bedtime even more appealing, consider exploring different bed options that they might find exciting, such as bunk beds, canopy beds, or themed beds. You can also consider investing in mid sleepers with storage, which can not only provide them with a comfortable place to sleep but also help keep their room organized and clutter-free. With built-in drawers or shelves, your children can keep their favorite books, toys, or bedtime essentials close at hand.
Get Back Mealtimes on Track: Meal times also go awry during the summer, much like the sleep schedules. Having meals at a specific time is the first step towards having a sound and healthy sleep. It is a good idea to slowly adjust the timing of the meals prepared to times that they are usually served during school days. It is easier for the children to have their meals at specific times; in addition to dinner, meals during lunchtimes can be served at the same time that it is served at the school.
Maintain a Healthy Activity Schedule: Striving to keep the child active during daytime along with adjusting meal and sleep schedules allows for a smoother transition into the new routine. However, ensure that the activity level is reduced by the evenings so that they are not too excited by dinner time.
Additional Tip: Depending on which part of the country you are staying in, it is possible that the sun is still up in the latter half of the evening. A sleep blindfold or a similar object will be of great help for the child to stick to regular sleep timings in places where light stands in the way of sleep.
In summary, it is important that you adjust yourself to each and every aspect that affects schedules of your children during the transition from summer holiday time to regular school routine",0.9726018905639648,894,1.7466936111450195

"According to research, a good standing business should spend between 15% and 30% of its gross revenue on the payroll. For the firms spending $82.6 billion on payroll and bookkeeping in 2020, the investment is significant.
With the options available today for payroll automation, the question is not if you should use payroll software but rather what payroll software can best work for you.
Here’s a closer look at four essential payroll software for accountants to help you run your business.
- Gusto: Nimble Choice for Small Business Payroll
Gusto is payroll software developed with small businesses in mind to help them manage payroll for independent contractors and employees.
The software offers an unlimited number of pay runs at no extra cost, which is useful if you need to run payroll several times.
Additionally, you can have a support team at hand to help you set up via live chat. That’s in addition to a searchable support center as well as video guides.
Some of the benefits Gusto can help you process include:
- 401(K) retirement
- Health insurance
- Commuter benefits
- Flexible spending accounts
- Health savings accounts
- 529 savings plans
When it comes to payment options, Gusto allows you to use checks and 2-day direct deposits. You can also decide to use payroll available on-demand or a cashout feature (that facilities payroll as your workers earn it).
What about time off? Gusto allows you to set a paid time off (PTO) policy within its system. That way, you can manage the time each employee takes and, at any time, tell how much each employee has.
Gusto boasts several integrations with:
- Receipt Bank
- When I Work
The complete Gusto package starts at $39, with an additional $6 for every employee or contractor.
Keep in mind that Gusto does not offer insurance in 24 out of the 50 states.
- Patriot Software: Full-Service Payroll for the Budget-Conscious
If you are looking for a cost-conscious payroll option, then Patriot is right up your alley.
You can run full-service payroll with the free software at $30 a month plus $4 per employee or contractor.
If you are more of a do-it-yourself (DIY) kind of person, then for $10, Patriot will let you run payroll (even though filing and paying of payroll taxes will be up to you).
The option to test it out with DIY payroll before taking on the full service is a feature you don’t find with other payroll software in the big leagues.
Setting up Patriot is easy as fewer features, meaning you have fewer things to figure out. If you run into any issues, support over email, live chat, or the phone can sort you out. There’s also a searchable Help Center to enable you to resolve any issues you may have.
You also get an unlimited payroll run at no additional cost.
When you need to make payments, you can do so via checks or direct deposits. For direct deposits, Patriot software requires a lead time of four days.
One thing you ought to weigh is the software’s lack of capability to process benefits or insurance.
- PayStubCreator: Affordable Pay Stubs for Small Businesses and Freelancers
In recent history, the pay stub market has been hit with scammers. The group that’s taken the biggest hit has been small businesses and freelancers who can’t afford more expensive services.
PayStubCreator is created by accountants to enable these small businesses and freelancers to find an affordable and convenient way to generate pay stubs.

PayStubCreator comes with round-the-clock customer service and a 30-day money-back guarantee for unsatisfied customers.
- ADP: Payroll Flexibility for Startups and Growing Businesses
Do you plan to scale up your operations in the next five years? ADP is payroll software built to cater to that exact need.
ADP offers different payroll options for large businesses, medium and small firms. As such, you can start with the software and still stick to it as your business expands.
There will be no need to migrate to another software whenever you enter a new level of growth.
There is assistance from the company when setting up ADP, but the process can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to set up.
The extensive feature range means there’s a learning curve. Once you figure things out, though, you have a wide variety of options.
ADP enables you to handle a wide range of benefits and insurance such as:
- Health, dental, vision, disability and life insurance for your employees

If you need to share a file with a third-party provider, ADP can output a generic file for you.
To purchase ADP, you need to contact a representative. You’ll also have to pay $200 for a setup fee though some representatives can waive this.
Nonprofits stand to receive a 25% discount when signing up to ADP depending on the availability of the offer.

"The Ark of the Covenant was surely one of the most important objects ever in the Jewish tradition. It contained both sets of the Ten Commandments (one in pieces) and a sample of the manna that our ancestors lived on during the forty years of wandering in the desert.
And yet somehow it just disappeared. It features prominently in Scripture, both in the Torah and in other books of the Bible, up until around the first time the Temple was destroyed in 586 BCE. And then it just disappears and is not mentioned again. What happened to it?
I, your humble rabbi, have played a small – well, very small – part in the search for the Lost Ark of the Covenant. Although to be honest, I was more part of a dramatization of the search for the Ark for entertainment purposes, than a real explorer. You can see me in a TV show on the Science Channel, “Unlock the Secrets of the Lost Ark” with a hard hat and light, prowling through Zecharia’s Cave in Jerusalem, in the rubble under the Temple Mount, searching for the lost ark. A real Indiana Jones moment for me. You can also catch me on Montreal native William Shatner’s UnXplained, Season 3 Episode 3, “The Search for the Ark of the Covenant” explaining to viewers the significance of the ark and discussing what might have happened to it.
Today I will share with you some background on the ark and my theory on what happened to it.
A verse in this week’s Torah reading, Behaalotcha, hints at why the Ark was so important. It’s a familiar verse: we recite it every time we take the Torah out of the ark.
Vayihi binsoa haaron, vayomer Moshe: kuma, Adonai, v’yafutzu oyvecha, viyanusu mipanecha m’sanecha
And it was when the ark traveled, Moses said, “Arise, Adonai, and may your enemies be scattered, may those who hate you flee from your presence!”
This is a somewhat perplexing passage. What does the ark traveling have to do with enemies being scattered?
The commentators are all over the map in trying to understand what these verses are about. The Midrash, Sifrei, asks who could be enemies of God? The answer—enemies of Israel! The Slonimer rebbe suggests we should understand these verses metaphorically and consider talmidei chochamim, Torah scholars, the ark—after all, it is within people that the Torah really resides. Although that interpretation doesn’t necessarily make any sense either – do you see enemies fleeing from Torah scholars?
However, it may be that a less interpretive reading, and a more literal reading is closer to the original intent. The tradition claims that the ark WAS imbued with mystical powers that allowed the Israelites to prevail over their enemies. If so, the ark’s ability to help us conquer our enemies could explain why this is so important as to merit being set apart from the rest of the Torah.
The power of the ark is mentioned in several places in the Torah. Consider the caution given after Aaron’s sons, Nadav and Avihu are killed for offering strange fire to the Lord: “The Lord said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he should not come at all times into the holy place within the veil before the throne of mercy, which is upon the Ark, so that he does not die: for I will appear in the cloud upon the throne of mercy.”
The throne of mercy was the slab of pure gold which served as the cover for the ark, on which rested the two cherubim. God’s presence was said to rest on the Ark, and approaching at the wrong time could lead to sudden death!
If you’ve ever seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, you might have thought that all that fantastical stuff about the powers of the Ark, how it could level mountains, lay waste regions, and protect any Army carrying it was all made up. Not so! The writers of Raiders of the Lost Ark relied directly on material in the Jewish tradition—in the Bible and in the Midrash.
The Bible and Midrash are full of legends which attest to the powers of the Ark. Most of the legends about the ark are in the later books of the Tanakh, not in the Torah itself.
There’s a midrash that claims the Ark was the ancient Hebrews’ navigational device. The Ark led the way in the desert. As the people would break camp, Moses would tell them to do what the Shechinah (Divine presence) within the Ark commands. But the people wouldn’t believe Moses that the Shechinah dwelt among them unless he spoke the words in this week’s parsha: “Arise, Lord, and let your enemies be scattered, let them that hate you flee before you.” At which point the Ark would move, the people would believe, and the Ark would soar up high and swiftly move before the camp a distance of three days march, settling in a suitable camping spot. Wouldn’t that be useful for those summer vacations when all the good camp sites seem to be taken!
The Midrash also tells us that the Ark provided protection in the desert, with sparks or fiery jets issuing forth from the cherubim that killed off the serpents and scorpions in the path of the Israelites, and burned away all the thorns on the path that might injure the hikers. As if that’s not sweet enough, the smoke from the zapped thorns rose straight in a column, and perfumed the whole world!
Everyone knows about the parting of the waters at the Red Sea. Not everyone knows about a second parting of the waters—of the Jordan River. In the book of Joshua we learn that when the Israelites were entering the Promised Land, as the priests who were carrying the Ark set foot into the Jordan River, the waters piled up behind, and allowed them to walk across on dry land. The midrash expands on this story, and says that the waters rose to a height of 300 miles!!! The midrash says the Ark remained in the middle of the riverbed while all the people crossed, and once all the people were across, the Ark set forward all on its own, dragging the priests entrusted with its care after it, until it overtook the people!
Once they got the Ark to Israel, the first stop was to conquer Jericho. Most people have heard the story of how the Jews walked around the city, blew on the trumpets, and the walls came tumbling down. But an important part of the story is that the important factor in the walls coming down was not the blowing of the trumpets, but rather the presence of the Ark, which was carried around the city.
Having the Ark in your possession was NOT a guarantee of victory in battle, as evidenced by the story told in the book of Samuel, when the Philistines captured the Ark. The Philistines quickly realized they had a hot potato—where ever the Ark was, statues of the Philistine god Dagon were knocked down, people died, and those who didn’t die were afflicted with a horrible case of hemorrhoids. The Philistines loaded the Ark on a wagon and it sent it back to the Jews. With an “offering” of five golden hemorrhoids for good measure.
There are several stories told of people escorting the Ark dying mysterious deaths.
The Ark had a few other remarkable powers. According to the Midrash, when they were bringing the Ark to Geba, the priests who tried to take hold of it were raised up in the air and thrown violently to the ground. Another story told of the Ark is that when the Queen of Sheba came to visit Solomon, Solomon used the Ark to distinguish between men who were circumcised and men who were not!
Given all of these magical powers, and the fact that the Ark held the testimony to the covenant between Man and God, the tablets of the Ten Commandments, the Ark and its contents were clearly the most important object in Jewish history. There is nothing that is even a close second. Which makes it all the more mysterious that the Ark could disappear without a trace. The very last reference we have to the Ark anywhere in the Bible is in 2 Chronicles, where it says King Josiah told the Levites to put the Ark in the Temple, the implication being that it had been moved from there earlier by King Menashe. This was late in the First Temple period, 7th century BCE, probably 30 or 40 years before the Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians. And that is the very last mention of the Ark in the Bible—yet there is a lot of history which comes after.
Nowhere in the Bible does it mention the Ark either being carried off in the destruction of the First Temple, or it being returned after the Persians allowed the Jews to rebuild the Temple. There are no further references to the Ark whatsoever. Not only has the Ark physically disappeared, but even the scriptural history of the Ark stops totally abruptly.
The book of 2 Maccabees, part of the Apocrypha not included in the Hebrew Bible, but part of the Catholic Bible, claims that the prophet Jeremiah spirited the ark out of Jerusalem and hid it in a cave in the Judean desert.
The Talmud gives a few different theories. One says Josiah hid the Ark before the invading army of Nebuchadnezzar came and destroyed the Temple the first time. Another says that one time a priest noticed something hidden under the wood house by the Temple, but he was struck dead before he could reveal the secret to others, intimating it’s under the Temple Mount.
There are those who believe that this story in the Talmud is what actually happened, and that the Ark remains hidden away under the Temple mount somewhere, waiting to be unearthed. That’s my favorite theory.
But there is another tale told. The Christians of Ethiopia claim that the Ark, the most sacred object in Judaism, the Ark which could kill 50,000 who just looked at it (sounds like a nuclear explosion, no?) is in Ethiopia.
The Ethiopians claim that when the Queen of Sheba visited Solomon, she took a little souvenir home: the Ark of the Covenant! The path the Ark supposedly took in getting from Jerusalem to Axum is a very long and complicated story. Interestingly, every Ethiopian Christian church has a tabot, which is a replica of the Ark. These replicas of the Ark are what gives the church its sanctity. When they bring the replicas out, they are covered in cloth wrappings so no one can actually see them.
Not only does each church have a replica, but the Ethiopians claim that in the town of Axum in Northern Ethiopia, in the church of Saint Mary of Zion, guarded over by one old Ethiopian who tried to flee when told he was appointed guardian of the Ark, rests the Ark of the Covenant.
Should we search for the actual physical Ark? If it’s in Ethiopia, should we ask for it back? Should we hunt for it under the Temple Mount?
Despite my televised poking around looking for the Ark, I don’t think so.
The Torah tells us the Ark was so special no one could look at it anyway. Another reason not to have it in our possession is it would be far too easy to turn it into an opportunity for idol worship. To focus on the box, not the contents, the tablets, not the teachings. Having the Ark and putting it on display in a museum would make Judaism seem like another museum religion, like the Egyptian sun worshippers for example, a religion with interesting artifacts, but no relevance to the present.
No, it’s better to remember what the Slonimer Rebbe said. The Ark that counts is the person. The Ark that is eternal—the Ark that cannot be lost, stolen, or destroyed is the Ark of the Jewish people, who keep the covenant engraved on their hearts, not engraved on stone. And it is that Ark which will scatter our enemies—we will scatter our enemies through the strength, wisdom, and courage we gain from living lives guided by God and Torah.",0.9663716554641724,2610,2.7496931552886963

"Currents News Staff and Bill Miller
BROWNSVILLE — When Denise Robinson was shown an apartment unit at the Catholic Charities Pope Francis Apartments at Loreto, she knew she had found a new home.
“My eyes got big, and I was like a kid just after Santa Claus came,” said Robinson, who in mid-April settled into one of the 135 units. “I didn’t ask to see another one. I said, ‘Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus!’ ”
Bishop Robert Brennan and Bishop Emeritus Nicholas DiMarzio joined Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens (CCBQ) in dedicating the eight-story complex with a ribbon-cutting on Thursday, April 28.
This site, 2377 Pacific St. in the Brownsville area, was once home to Our Lady of Loreto Parish. Structural problems forced the demolition of the church in 2017.
About half of the apartments have already been leased for low-income and formerly homeless senior citizens like Robinson, who struggles with back and hip ailments.
Robinson and her new neighbors now have access to Catholic Charities Neighborhood Services, including an on-call nurse, health counseling, and case management. Amenities include 24-hour security, a fitness room, two large community rooms, and laundry room.
Rooftop solar panels cut the building’s utility bills and its carbon footprint, in accordance with the environmental leadership expressed by Pope Francis in his 2015 encyclical, “Laudato Sí.”
Bishop Brennan said that as the new head of the Diocese of Brooklyn, “you find yourself taking bows for work that other people did.
“And so,” he continued, “I’m proud to pick up the baton from Bishop DiMarzio and all of the work that went into the planning and all of the construction of this project.”
CCBQ broke ground on this affordable housing project in January 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic struck two months later, but construction continued while other projects in the area stalled.
That’s because affordable housing projects were exempted from the lockdowns, said Tim McManus, senior vice president of CCBQ’s Progress of Peoples (POP) Development Corporation. This organization develops affordable housing for Catholic Charities.
Although construction at the Pacific Street site continued, it was not without pandemic problems, McManus said.
“Everything we know about construction and real estate development changed because of COVID,” he said. “We had to adapt to new ways of doing things. Case in point: we had to learn how to do things remote.
“We had specialty software that the general contractor would [use to] walk around and do video tours so we could actually inspect without coming here, without the risk,” McManus added. “If someone from the outside came in and had COVID and infected someone on the site, we would have had to shut down for three weeks, potentially more.”
Including the rooftop solar panels added to CCBQ’s experience of developing clean alternative energy solutions. CCPOP launched its Laudato Si’ Corporation in 2021 to do just that. CCPOP now runs several solar arrays in the CCBQ housing portfolio.
Like Robinson, new resident Michael Freeman was ecstatic to have a new home
“I’m just so happy,” he exclaimed, verging on tears. “I want to scream and shout. But I don’t want to embarrass myself.”
Freeman, who spoke during the dedication, explained later that he became homeless during the pandemic, He fell into depression when family members died of COVID. He entered homeless shelters, but Catholic Charities quickly helped him find a new home.

The e-mail deliverability is also top-notch and you won’t have an issue with emails getting thrown into the spam folder.

So what you will see is my 100% unbiased, truthful viewpoint of the tool, and whether it’s right for you. So with that said, let’s proceed with the video. To start off with, just what is?

rather sceptical of these all-in-one platforms. I kept a psychological note as I was in fact going through the functions and the tools and in basic, the entire system.

You don’t need a multitude of different tools and memberships that build up in expenses, things like email marketing, a website and webhosting, a landing page builder, and a course hosting site. Another benefit of these all-in-one platforms is that all of the different tools incorporate with one another without any dispute. And in general, the drawback as specified, these all-in-one platforms may not be excellent or a master of that one aspect of an online company platform. Another failure, but one that’s quite rare is that because you are hosting everything on that one platform, you are putting your eggs in my basket. However those are some basic things to understand about all-in-one platforms before you think about signing up to one. The most significant standout of is that they offer a totally free strategy, including their entire suite of tools.’s rates.

"Fighting Mass Surveillance
Israel’s human rights organisations, including many NIF grantees, have written to the Attorney General, Avichai Mandelblit, and the Israel Police demanding that they immediately stop the use of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware in investigations.
Last week Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist revealed that the Israel Police routinely used the cyberattack tool without a court order against numerous people — including the protestors from the anti-corruption “Black Flags” political movement that led protests against former Prime Minister Netanyahu outside of his residence on Jerusalem’s Balfour Street and around the country.
NSO was blacklisted by the US Department of Commerce last November for allegedly using its flagship Pegasus spyware for “transnational repression” and acting against US national interests. NSO was already in hot water following the investigation last summer by Amnesty International and Forbidden Stories, which was published in The Washington Post, The Guardian, and other newspapers. The report claimed that Pegasus was used by governments to breach the mobile phones of human rights activists, journalists, and political opponents, as well as foreign governments. NSO also faces a major lawsuit from Apple in the US for hacking its phones. Pegasus is a unique spyware tool in that it can be installed in the target’s smartphone without a need for the user to press on any links.
The latest NSO Group revelations have shocked Israelis and the human rights organisations. The letter demanding the immediate halt of the use of this technology included The Movement for Freedom of Information, Israeli Privacy, the Israel Internet Association, The Israel Democracy Institute, Haifa University Technology and Cyber Law Clinic, and the Zulat Institute for Equality and Human Rights.
Association of Civil Rights (ACRI) Attorney Anne Suciu said that the Israel Police’s use of Pegasus is an absolute scandal.
“There are very detailed regulations enshrined in law about when it is permitted to listen in on conversations and infiltrate phones. It has been revealed that the police have gone far beyond what the law allows. Even if there were court orders every time the software was used, there is no legal arrangement that permits this, because in addition to tapping conversations, [the software] takes complete control of the phone – these options were not what the lawmakers intended. Even if we accept the police claims that everything was done legally, this software is a Trojan horse that infiltrates the phone, and that is against the law .”
Israel’s State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman has announced an investigation into the use of Pegasus by the Israel Police.

"Nikolai Starikov: How the United States ""brought the European Union to its knees"" with sanctions against Russia
How the United States ""brought the European Union to its knees"" with sanctions against Russia
The sanctions that were imposed against Russia were actually imposed mostly against the European Union. And therefore, EU officials, of course, did not say what sad consequences these sanctions would lead to for the economy, first of all, Germany, France, and other European countries. Well, in order for them to be accepted, it was necessary to wrap them somehow. Therefore, ""let's do it, because Russia will immediately be defeated,"" and so on.
In fact, the United States has brought to its knees, of course, not Russia — they have brought the European Union to its knees. Therefore, when we observe the position of the leaders of the European Union today, it is obvious to us that they have become much softer, more plasticine, more compliant than they were before the start of their own and the introduction of large-scale sanctions against our country.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz can be cited as an example. What an evolution he went through from a man who did not want to supply anything but helmets and bandages to someone who resists the supply of long-range missiles. And this is just a direct consequence of the sanctions.

"What do soap bubbles and grasshoppers have in common? As it turns out, they can both be used to help students learn about modern materials and their engineering applications.
This summer, Dr. Scott Ramsay and Professor Uwe Erb (both MSE) each led an undergraduate student team from the Department of Materials Science & Engineering (MSE). Students teamed up to develop new educational kits that will help fellow students learn introductory engineering concepts.
The first group worked with Ramsay on a project called Materials One as part of the engineering course, MSE101. They collaborated on new methods to help first-year students grasp challenging concepts in materials science. The other group, part of the nanOntario outreach program led by Erb, developed instructional kits for high school students.
“The concepts we teach in materials engineering are often new to our students and can be challenging to grasp,” said Ramsay. “There isn’t really an equivalent prerequisite course at the Ontario secondary school level. That’s why we have students come up with educational aids – to facilitate learning at a level that speaks to other students. And, it’s really a lot of fun for everyone.”
Take a look at the two groups that came up with fun – and sometimes sticky – learning activities.
Undergraduate students Anastasia Alksnis (MSE 1T6), Roberto Aurilio (MSE 1T5), Daniel Levitt (MSE 1T7), and Xiaoji (Iris) Zhang (MSE 1T5) developed a series of hands-on activities and learning aids that complement MSE 101 – the first-year materials science and engineering course offered across the Faculty.
One of the activities the group came up with asks students to blow soap bubbles onto a flat surface forming a so-called ‘bubble raft.’ Developed in the late 1940s, this technique was first used by researchers to model atoms in solids. Now reimagined for MSE 101, students will be challenged to take photos of their bubble rafts, which show the best examples of various microstructural features – features that contribute to materials properties and performance.
“Working on the Materials One project was a great way for me to reinforce what I had learned in MSE 101,” said Levitt, whose group was supported by the Faculty’s Engineering Instructional Innovation Program. “I hope our efforts will help future students engage with the curriculum and build a solid foundation for their upper year studies.”
Watch Dr. Scott Ramsay perform the elephant toothpaste experiment at a local elementary school, illustrating catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide – an experiment prepared by Materials One project student Xiaoji (Iris) Zhang.
Now in its fifth year, nanOntario is a youth outreach program led by Professor Uwe Erb (MSE) aimed at educating secondary school students about bio-inspired nanotechnology found in Ontario’s outdoors.
Tasked with designing instructional kits to facilitate the course, undergraduates must think deeply about materials science subjects in order to best deliver the information. In this way, the learning is two-fold, as both high school and university-level participants benefit from the course.
This year’s theme was “Hexagonal Structures”. Participants investigated the prevalence of six-sided surface structures in nature, and how humans have mimicked these shapes to enhance technologies.
For example, katydids – an insect similar to the grasshopper – have hexagonal micro-patterns on their legs that help them attach to surfaces when jumping from place to place. A similar pattern can be found in certain winter tires to improve traction for driving safely in slippery conditions.
Partnered with Hitachi High-Technologies Canada (HHTC), participants of the course have access to a portable scanning electron microscope that enable discovery at the atomic level, including a close-up look at the surface structure of insect legs.
“As students shift more of their studies towards the use of online materials, one of the best functions of classroom and tutorial time is to make use of demonstrations and hands on activities to facilitate different modes of learning,” said Professor Jun Nogami, Chair of the Department of Materials Science & Engineering. “The ideal way to develop these new teaching materials is to involve students in their development from the very beginning.”",0.9485703110694885,908,3.293017625808716
"Saaremaa rural municipality is to set up a crisis home for all nursing home residents who have contracted coronavirus, but do not require hospitalization.
The home in question, Saaremaa Südamekodu, proposed the initiative to the islands crisis committee, which agreed.
A property run by Saaremaa Südamekodu at Upa, close to the island's capital, Kuressaare, is to be used for the crisis home, and will be run by Saaremaa's crisis committee, as are all nursing homes on the island, which has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic.
Twenty-two residents and three members of staff at a Südamekodu Care home in Saaremaa tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) last Friday, the Health Board (Terviseamet) says.
Saaremaa mayor Madis Kallas, who is chair of the crisis committee and himself contracted coronavirus and is working from home, said quick decisions are vital in the emergency situation.
""We are very grateful to the Saaremaa Südamekodu for its cooperation in helping elderly islanders to obtain the best possible care during a crisis,"" said Kallas, adding it was a good example of a community-based approach, where people are the priority rather than who owns and operates the home.
Martin Kukk, Saaremaa Südamekodu board member, added his organization will place all its resources at the disposal of the Saaremaa crisis committee.
""Additional help is needed to protect the lives and health of people residing with Saaremaa Südamekodu board member, added his organization will place all its resources at the disposal of the Saaremaa crisis committee. as well as in other care homes, and particularly [also] for staff,"" Kukk said.
The Saaremaa rural municipality government and Saaremaa Südamekodu signed a written agreement on the matter on Sunday.

"Each year since 1970, we have celebrated Earth Day on April 22 to remind the world that we need to take care of our home – our planet — and to reflect on our relationship with it.
In the events industry, we are committed to integrating best practices for the environment into our events while demonstrating corporate and individual commitment to sustainable practices. We are supporting the sustainability standards and guidelines, and raising awareness and educating employees, as well as event attendees, about the environment conservation.
And at the same time, we acknowledge the difficulties and challenges we face when trying to make our world better. Earth Day is a great opportunity for all of us to show our commitment to making events more sustainable.
Event organizers, destinations, venues and numerous suppliers have an amazing opportunity to celebrate it both in their offices and with their teams not only during Earth Day itself, but also all the year round when organizing events and sharing their knowledge with their many stakeholders.
Earth Day 2024
On Earth Day 2024, EIC was especially encouraged and inspired by the growing number of global business events industry colleagues who have shown their commitment to sustainability. Whether it’s through pursuing the individual Sustainable Event Professional Certificate or working to achieve the EIC Sustainable Event Standards, our industry is making major strides towards a more sustainable future for all.
For example, the Kenes Group, a global PCO (Professional Conference Organiser) with employees in 18 locations around the world, developed a series of Earth Day activities for their more than 350 employees, all focused on ways to increase the positive impact on the circular economy. Several offices held their own Earth Day Bazaars and Donations Day, where employes were encouraged to bring in clothes and books for a “swap and shop” activity. Anything not picked by a fellow employee was donated to local charities and non-profits.
How did you celebrate Earth Day? We’d love to hear your stories.",0.9632546901702881,390,1.6287567615509033
"Kenya Perezgil participated in sweat lodge ceremonies in her family’s backyard for as long as she can remember. Inside the dome-shaped hut, a fire pit burned lava stones infused with a herbal tea mixture to cleanse their spirits and connect them with their ancestors.
“My parents taught me that I am the reflection of the Earth, the Creator and to always acknowledge the natural world’s elements,” said Perezgil, a child and adolescent studies student at Cal State Fullerton. “All Native and Indigenous tribes rely on the natural world to sustain all that exists, and it is our responsibility to keep Mother Earth alive and well.”
Since she was a young girl, her parents instilled values that are rooted in community, leadership and respect. Over the years, she became a staunch advocate for increasing cultural awareness and preserving Native American lands in Mexico, Colombia and Peru.
After transferring from the College of the Desert to Cal State Fullerton, Perezgil wanted to connect her Indigenous roots with her experience in higher education. She discovered the Inter-Tribal Student Council, a student-led organization that champions Indigenous and Native culture. Perezgil serves as president of council and had the opportunity to deliver a land acknowledgment at the university’s 2024 Convocation and State of the University.
“Native and Indigenous people are in the process of collectively regaining our culture, power and resources,” said Perezgil. “I actively encourage all students to absorb the deep history and wisdom about the land we are standing on.”
The club’s general meetings consist of educational films, talking circles, powwow dances, social outings, nature walks, workshops, and conversations with representatives from the Native and Indigenous communities.
“The Inter-Tribal Student Council exists for us to support each other through our educational journey while learning more about the diversity of Native culture,” said Perezgil.
Plans are underway for a new Native American and Indigenous Resource Center in the Pollak Library as part of Diversity Initiatives and Resource Centers’ expansion efforts. Until a new center opens, students can access resources through Native American and Indigenous Student Services.
The Healing Force of Horseback Riding
With plans to graduate in spring 2025, Perezgil aspires to become a licensed therapist specializing in equine therapy for youth. She felt inspired to care for generations of families through the Native philosophy that children are Earth’s protectors.
“I would like to honor the Native philosophy and be an advocate for children and families,” she said. “My intention is to promote harmonious connections within families.”
She envisions equine therapy as an accessible and transformative counseling practice through the healing force of horseback riding.
As a horse owner for over eight years, Perezgil understands the therapeutic benefits of horseback riding and interacting with horses. She explained that horses function as mirrors, motivating people to reflect on their thoughts and behaviors.
“Horses are highly sensible animals that emit peace and tranquility to any person in their surroundings,” said Perezgil. “Horses helped me build my confidence and shift my mindset to an ‘I can’ attitude.”
Perezgil credits CSUF for enriching her education with hands-on therapy experience.
To obtain her degree, Perezgil practiced 60 hours of applied behavior analysis therapy for children with autism.
“I learned that working with children with autism is a very fulfilling experience, and it brought me to tears of joy when I saw progress within my client,” Perezgil said. “I was patient and detailed during my sessions with him. We quickly built a bond and I wish our connection would last forever.”",0.9592464566230774,773,2.0264806747436523
"Disclaimer: The views expressed in this interview are solely those of the interviewee.
Past ISSTD President, Dr Warwick Middleton, MD interviewed Nick Bryant in August 2019 to discuss Nick’s work investigating cases of organised child abuse. This interview pre-dates Epstein’s death and the risk to his life is discussed within the interview, a foreshadowing of events to come.
This is the second part of a two-part series. To read Part One click here.
Warwick Middleton: I’m going to ask for your thoughts in regards to the Epstein matter, and we’re going to talk more about it. One of the key witnesses that has made her testimony quite public is Virginia Roberts, or Virginia Guiffre as she now known. She has stated that she was pandered by Jeffrey Epstein to a large number of rich and powerful figures who include senior political figures and a member of the British royal family. She (also) says – and this is yet to be fully established by other witnesses – that Jeffrey Epstein was secretly recording at least some of the sexual contacts she allegedly had with senior figures and that presumably tapes of these contacts exist somewhere. We know that very recently when the Southern District of New York launched an investigation that the first thing they did was to use a crow-bar to break Jeffrey Epstein’s front door to his 7-story mansion and to go then straight to his safe. What do you think is going on?
Nick Bryant: One of the discs was allegedly labelled with the name of a person who is affluent, a powerbroker and then (the name of) a victim. We don’t know the victim and we don’t know the power-broker. But I have known that Jeffrey Epstein has been clandestinely taping people. In 2005, when the Palm Beach Police Depart served a warrant on Jeffrey Epstein’s home, they found two hidden cameras. Hidden cameras have been a part of his reality for quite some time.
What I try to tell people, when they say “Jeffrey Epstein has a person compromised”, (is that) if you are compromising powerful people, people who have access to thugs, murderers, you have to have an organisation behind you that is very powerful. You can’t be just Jeffrey Epstein and whack people. So, these people knew that if they tried to do something to Jeffrey Epstein, something would be visited upon them that is far worse.
So, if you are blackmailing very powerful people – you cannot do that and live, unless you have an organisation behind you. And those people that you are blackmailing have got to be aware of that organisation, or else they will take you out in a heartbeat. Legs broken, arms broken or whatever they do.
Warwick Middleton: You were the first person, via Gawker, to publish full details of Epstein’s so-called “Little Black Book” and the flight manifests of Epstein’s private jet. Can you, in an overview, tell us what you think is going on with Jeffrey Epstein and what sort of a network he is involved with?
Nick Bryant: I acquired the “Black Book” about five or six years ago, and at the same time, I acquired the passenger manifest. What is troubling is that I pitched that “Black Book” to every major magazine in New York and none of them would touch it. So that was frustrating for me. I had so much evidence at that point, I had police reports. I had everything and I still couldn’t get anybody to touch it. The response to Epstein is very similar to what I experienced with Larry King and Spence. Epstein ran a very large paedophile network, that panders young girls to rich and powerful men, just the way that King and Spence ran a network that pandered mostly boys, but also young girls, to powerful people. They are very similar and blackmail I believe was part of the Epstein network and certainly blackmail was part of the King and Spence network. Federal and local law enforcement got corrupted in Epstein’s case – when he had to do 13 months for all the girls he molested, and especially when the Feds had a list of like, 38 victims. So, it is very, very similar to what I have written about in “The Franklin Scandal”, very similar.
Warwick Middleton: If you were to actually compare the two, what are the key points of similarity?
Nick Bryant: You’ve got underaged kids being flown all around, state to state, being molested with impunity by rich and powerful men, and then you’ve got a corruption of local and federal law enforcement and the judiciary. I think that those are the common denominators, and of course I think that there is blackmail going on – with both networks. So, I think there are a number of similarities about what people are finding out about Epstein and the Franklin scandal.
Warwick Middleton: What do you make of the fact that in both scenarios a key powerful abuser has reasonably intimate connections with one or more American presidents?
Nick Bryant: It shows that these networks go all the way to the top of the food-chain. The Franklin scandal went all the way to the top of the food-chain and I believe that Jeffrey Epstein’s network does too. That’s why they had to be covered up – there’s too many politicians, too many powerful people, very powerful people, who would be exposed if a network like that isn’t covered up.
Warwick Middleton: Can you think of any other example in US history, where we’ve had not one, but two American presidents, falling over themselves to go on the public record to distance themselves from a predatory paedophile?
Nick Bryant: Yes, it is pretty amazing. I hope this opens up the minds of Americans, and I think it is happening a little bit. I see really similar stories by the mainstream media regarding Jeffrey Epstein. They are getting away from the fact that Jeffrey Epstein pandered children to rich and powerful people. They are writing about Jeffrey Epstein’s DNA and things like that, which kind of bothers me a little bit. I’d really like the media to stick to how he got away with molesting so many kids with impunity and also, what we really need to find out is who were the other guys molesting these kids? That’s what we really need to know. That’s what the media really should be focussed on right now – the fact that Epstein really wasn’t the only guy who was molesting these kids. The media really needs to dig into that.
Warwick Middleton: Nick, within a few days of being arrested and put in a Manhattan prison, there seemingly was either an attempt to murder Jeffrey Epstein, or alternatively, an attempt by himself, to suicide. Is it not hard to imagine that there are a whole lot of people who would breathe a sigh of relief if Epstein, one way or another, was dead at this point?
Nick Bryant: You have to keep in mind that Epstein corrupted a US attorney who was ultimately made US Secretary of Labour, one of the most powerful positions in the US government. There was that much power deployed that they corrupted a US attorney. So, ultimately with Epstein, what is interesting – is that with the Franklin scandal, Craig Spence committed suicide. I don’t think he was “suicided”. I think he committed suicide. I think that all his money had been taken away. He’d become a crack addict and he could no longer function the way that he needed to function. So, I think he took his own life. Now with King, he did ten years in prison and was taken care of after he got out of prison. He was basically given a no-show job and he kept his mouth shut.
Now with Epstein, he’s going to do the rest of his life in prison, at this point. There is an outside chance of him talking, so that he could get his sentence reduced. I just don’t think that is going to happen. I think that with the people that Jeffrey Epstein pandered children to, it’s been shown how powerful they were, that they have been able to corrupt a grand jury and also a US attorney. I think Jeffrey Epstein knows that if he starts talking, his life won’t be very long. That’s what I believe.
Warwick Middleton: So, if you were advising authorities in terms of being able to deliver Jeffrey as a witness for some form of trial, what would you be doing?
Nick Bryant: If the system wasn’t thoroughly corrupted in regards to his case, you could make him a state witness, where he would testify, but I just don’t think that is going to happen. The way that the Trump administration is configured – I think the Attorney General is very corrupt. What is kind of interesting is that the Southern District for Manhattan are known for being “cowboys” as far as taking on cases. They aren’t sanctioned. They are known for really taking on the system. So, I haven’t figured out yet whether that move was by the Southern District acting unilaterally, or whether it was a Department of Justice directive that came down to the Southern District. I just don’t know at this point.
Warwick Middleton: Nick, you’ve been endeavouring for some years to have a documentary film series made on the Franklin scandal. You’ve also clearly been wanting to say more about the Epstein matter. What is the chance of you being able to get a film made or do some in-depth analysis associated with a publication in a mainstream media regarding Jeffrey Epstein?
Nick Bryant: Thus far two major magazines have shut me down with stories about Epstein. It is mind-boggling, because I know the Epstein story better than any other journalist in New York. I can see by their reporting that they are just jumping into this at the shallow end of the pool. They don’t understand the larger ramifications of Epstein. “The Franklin Scandal” has been optioned by Magnolia Pictures for three years. Magnolia has a very good reputation. Rob Reiner hooked up with Magnolia for a while and pitched “The Franklin Scandal”. We’ve been rejected by every network. I thought when Rob Reiner came on board, that that would be it, a slam-dunk at that point, but we were rejected by every network. You know, every magazine article I pitched on Franklin was rejected. I had an agent that tried to sell “The Franklin Scandal” book proposal, and it was a very large book, but he couldn’t sell it. So, I’ve been rejected on this thing forever. I just pitched another magazine article on Epstein today. The editor was aware of my work in this area, so hopefully I will get some good news about that. Magnolia Pictures has really hung in there. Most people have read about the rejections and have just given up on it. A few very distinguished film makers have given a rejection on Franklin, and that was it. But Magnolia Pictures have been having rejections on Franklin for like – three years, and they are still hanging in there with it, so I find that pretty amazing.
Warwick Middleton: Some have observed that nothing succeeds like persistence and you are one of the most persistent investigative journalists we’ve ever had.
Nick Bryant: (Laughs) At this point it would be very hard for me to do a u-turn. (both laugh) I’ve put a lot of effort in.
Warwick Middleton: Where do you see your work fitting in with the wider spectrum of things that have evolved in society’s awareness about trauma and also with what has happened within the field of trauma and dissociation? We are now in an age where powerful men who lead double-lives, are being exposed. There’s positives and negatives about that, but how much does that give you an entre to take forward your work?
Nick Bryant: It can’t hurt. That’s for sure. What I would like to do is make a docu-series or a film about Franklin. I’ve really wanted to do that. Magnolia has really hung in there with me. It’s great that I’ve found a team of people who don’t seem bothered by rejection – like me.
Epstein, there is a lot of stuff about Epstein that I have, that no one else has, so I would like to see a mainstream media magazine give me a shot at Epstein. Like I said, I’ve been rejected a couple of times by mainstream media magazines.
Warwick Middleton: As I have said Nick, this is just my opinion, but it seems like there is a really nice opportunity to have an article published that goes along the lines of, “We’ve been here before”. And you are in a unique position to do so. It draws together the key dynamics of the Franklin scandal, overlying the key dynamics of the Epstein scandal.
Nick Bryant: I think that would make a great article. Actually, that article has been rejected by two magazines already. I just pitched a magazine today. I’ve got some stuff on Epstein that no one has. So, we’ll see what happens. It’s really hard when you’ve been branded one way to get back in the groove with these editors and publishers in New York State. When you’ve been branded a “conspiracy theorist”, even though you have published a book, haven’t been sued, and everything I said about Jeffrey Epstein turned out to be true, man it’s very strange. You would think these editors and publishers would embrace you with both arms: “You’re Nick Bryant! You’ve been right all along!” (both laugh) “And we’re really sorry and we are going to publish everything that you write from here on in!” But I have not been treated as a conquering hero.
Warwick Middleton: The nature of human nature is that that rarely happens! And the one thing editors really hate is being exposed as being wrong.
Nick Bryant: You know, in New York the publishing industry is very myopic in a lot of ways, especially when you get into trauma, child abuse, paedophile networks. They would rather believe that it doesn’t happen. They’d just rather believe that.
My third book will be on sexual blackmail. This is about heterosexual honey-traps involving adults and which have led to a major change in the trajectory of history. I think it will be as mind-boggling as “The Franklin Scandal”. I’ve been working on it for quite some time. It’s as corroborated as “The Franklin Scandal”.

"Elon Musk Sues The View and Whoopi Goldberg for $90 Million: Claims They Are Lying About Him
In a move that has left many scratching their heads, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has filed a $60 million lawsuit against Whoopi Goldberg and The View. According to Musk, the talk show hosts have been spreading lies about him and his companies, and he’s had enough.
In a statement released to the press, Musk said, “It’s time to set the record straight. The View has been spreading lies about me and my businesses for far too long.
They’ve made unfounded accusations, questioned my integrity, and tried to paint me as some sort of villain. Well, enough is enough.”
The lawsuit, which was filed in a Los Angeles court, accuses Goldberg and the other hosts of making defamatory statements about Musk and his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla.
Among the allegations are claims that The View has accused Musk of cutting corners on safety, mistreating employees, and engaging in unethical business practices.
But some experts are skeptical of Musk’s claims. “This seems like a bit of an overreaction,” said legal analyst Karen Johnson. “The View is a talk show, and talk shows are known for being opinionated.
It’s not like they’re reporting news or conducting investigations. They’re just giving their thoughts on current events, and sometimes those thoughts are critical of people like Elon Musk.”
Despite the criticism, Musk is standing by his decision to sue. “I’m not saying that The View can’t have opinions,” he said.
“But when those opinions are based on lies and misinformation, it’s time to take action. I won’t stand by and let my reputation be destroyed by a bunch of talking heads on a daytime TV show.”
Only time will tell how this lawsuit will play out, but one thing’s for sure: Elon Musk is not backing down.",0.9807980060577393,431,0.9492426514625549
"Biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB) major Taylor Elliott ’23 has been a Rhodes Le Bonheur Summer Plus Research Fellow at Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital since his sophomore year. Last December, Elliott was invited to the annual American Epilepsy Society (AES) conference in Chicago, where he presented his clinical research project on the anti-seizure medication cenobamate (CNB) as the primary researcher, making him the first Rhodes student to attend the event.
A native Memphian, Elliott likes to say he’s been pre-med for as long as he can remember. He gained medical experiences in the Memphis area even before starting college, including four years at Baptist Memorial Hospital-Collierville and two years at UT/Methodist University Hospital during high school. Coming to Rhodes, Elliott was introduced to additional opportunities for clinical experience through Rhodes’ Health Professions Advising (HPA) department.
“I was immediately drawn to the Le Bonheur program,” says Elliott. “It offers a full clinical experience that concludes with the completion of a research project, so it’s an amazing opportunity for students in any discipline on the pre-med track.”
“It was the right decision for me and has since reaffirmed my interest in pursuing a professional degree in medicine. I am most interested in patient care, and seeing how small applications in medicine can make major improvements in the lives of pediatric patients has made the overall experience very rewarding for me.”
As part of the program, Elliott has been working as a clinical research assistant at Le Bonheur’s Neuroscience Institute in the comprehensive epilepsy program and is advised by Dr. Jonathan Fitz Gerald in Rhodes’ Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology for academic support. He was the first BMB major to apply to the Le Bonheur program, which typically attracts neuroscience majors, as fellows work in a neurology clinic. “As the only BMB applicant to the program, I quickly fell in love with neurology and neuroscience and enjoyed being able to see the overlap between the two disciplines. I came into the program eager to absorb every opportunity I could. While I felt prepared to rise to any challenge that was presented, I developed skills in notetaking, medical scribing, patient observation techniques, clinical research objectives, and scientific writing.”
Knowing his background, Elliott’s mentor, Dr. Jim Wheless, director of Le Bonheur’s Neuroscience Institute, guided him to find a project that could unify the fields of clinical neurology and biochemistry. Subsequent clinic visits with Dr. Wheless inspired him to complete a real-world study of pediatric patients and their responses to cenobamate, a relatively new anti-seizure medication prescribed to adults and adolescents with epilepsy. His research was the first to look at cenobamate’s impacts on the pediatric population and the previously excluded population of patients allergic to drugs that can be used in conjunction with the medication.
“Results showed greater than 60 percent significant reduction in seizure frequency and intensity, with some patients achieving seizure freedom for a few months,” says Elliott. “This medication can also provide relief for patients taking multiple medications with no symptom reduction. Our results show that it can be applied in epilepsy clinics across the country to the benefit of those patients needing a reduction in the number and severity of seizures they experience. That is why it is so important to continue working on its possible applications, especially for the youngest population of epilepsy patients, those aged 2 to 11 years.”
He submitted the abstract of his research to the American Epilepsy Society (AES) and was invited to give an in-person presentation at their December 2021 conference. Elliott then authored a full manuscript for the research, which has been published in the Journal of Pediatric Neurology.
“The AES annual conference is a place for researchers, physicians, and anyone who provides epilepsy care of varying degrees to come together and share their wisdom with other providers in the hopes of spreading awareness for certain diseases, new and promising medications, and skills and techniques that can alleviate stress and suffering of all epilepsy patients,” he explains.
At the conference, he was able to talk with and gain feedback from physicians, researchers, and pharmaceutical representatives from varied backgrounds. “I found myself talking with a physician from Brazil, a researcher from California, and representatives from companies all over the globe,” says Elliott.
“I felt like this was where I belonged. The most gratifying thing that I have witnessed time and time again at Le Bonheur, but experienced firsthand at the AES Conference, was that collaboration is far more important to medicine than the competition. Medicine is such a diverse and developing field, brimming with an even more diverse population of caregivers. Participating in the conference reaffirmed my passion for medicine, confirmed my interest in the biochemistry of neurology, and has inspired me to continue researching. Throughout this experience, I remain thankful for the guidance and support at Le Bonheur of Dr. Jim Wheless, Dr. Tracee Ridley-Pryor, and Mr. Andrew Gienapp.”

The accompanying caption to the viral job advertisement post adds a touch of humor, remarking, “Looks like this local momo shop is offering a better package than the average college in India these days,” cleverly poking fun at the current state of college placements and highlighting how enticing job opportunities can sometimes overshadow the significance of degrees.
The viral job advertisement post aims to shed light on the prevailing situation faced by numerous tier 2 and tier 3 MBA and engineering colleges in India. These institutions often struggle to deliver quality education and secure promising placements for their students.
The viral post is rapidly gaining traction, garnering over 71.8K views and continuing to attract attention. Netizens are flooding the comment section, expressing their opinions and thoughts on this unexpected job advertisement.
One comment reflects, “The reality that often goes unnoticed,” highlighting the discrepancy between expectation and reality in job opportunities.
Another comment humorously points out, “They didn’t specify if it’s per month,” suggesting a light-hearted skepticism regarding the salary mentioned in the advertisement.",0.9217755794525146,383,1.29132080078125
"When the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren spoke in a New Hampshire town hall last month, she promised to break up Silicon Valley monopolies and levy a wealth tax on “the Rembrandts and the diamonds” of the super-rich, before quipping: “I’m sick of freeloading billionaires.”
Days earlier, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders had addressed a rally in Concord, 45 miles west. He said his was a campaign that “tells the powerful special interests who control so much of our economic and political life that we will no longer tolerate the greed of Wall Street, corporate America and the billionaire class”.
During a road trip through the state days later, the former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke stopped at a university in Keene to lament an economy that only works for “the very few”. “We never had this kind of income and wealth inequality unless you go all the way back to the last Gilded Age,” he said.
Much has been said about the unprecedented diversity among Democrats vying to replace Donald Trump in the White House in 2020. But voters in New Hampshire, which will hold the first in the nation primary next year, can be forgiven for feeling they all sound kind of similar.
Reporters on the campaign trail constantly ask Democrats if they self-define as a “socialist” or “capitalist”. Yet a better label for several of the frontrunners may be “populist” – at least in the moderate, diluted form in which the term is commonly used in the US.
That reflects a wider populist turn in Democratic politics, born from a realisation that in 2016 it was Trump, a real estate billionaire, who did better than Democrat Hillary Clinton at channeling widespread voter frustration at economic elites.
Now Trump has become emblematic of the swamp he once promised to drain. The president has given tax cuts to America’s wealthiest, given his family White House portfolios, stacked his cabinet with friends and donors with a combined net worth estimated to be worth over $4bn, and overseen an administration that some historians argue is the most corrupt America has endured since the 1920s.
“All that is perfect terrain for a leftwing populist to pounce,” said Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University and the author of a book on American populism.
The movement that spawned the word ‘populism’
It is against this backdrop that Democrats are looking to a us-v-them style of politics redolent of the US agrarian revolts of the 1890s – the movement that spawned the word “populism” in the first place.
That was the era when an anti-elitist alliance of impoverished farmers, rail workers and union members briefly formed the Populist party, which called for an end to monopolies, a progressive income tax and government ownership of the railroads, telegraph services and post office.
After briefly threatening to upend America’s two-party system, the Populist party collapsed after selecting the Democratic nominee for president, William Jennings Bryan, who lost in 1896. But the movement has been credited with giving rise to a progressive era in Democratic politics that culminated in Franklin D Roosevelt’s 1930s New Deal.
The meaning of populism has evolved considerably since then, and scholars today generally accept populism can be deployed by capitalists as well as socialists. Rightwing populists came to the fore in American politics in the mid-2oth century with figures such as the segregationist governor of Alabama, George Wallace, and the Republican anti-communist senator Joseph McCarthy.
What populists across the spectrum have in common is a claim to serve the popular will of ordinary people in their quest to overcome powerful, self-serving elites. Kazin, who edits the leftwing magazine Dissent, said there has long been a rich seam of opposition to entrenched elites in American politics that “has always been there to be tapped” by politicians of all stripes.
Surges in populist rhetoric tend to be prompted by perceived political and economic crises. Kazin argues the current populist wave leads back to the 2008 financial crisis, which has framed American political discourse for more than a decade.
However, Kazin said he could not remember a presidential primary when so many prominent Democrats were running on a leftwing populist agenda – or a presidential contest, as 2020 may turn out to be, when both the Democrat and Republican are nominees are populists. “You’re probably not going to have a leading candidate this year – except, perhaps, Joe Biden – who is not going to be talking in pretty strongly populist terms,” he said.
The populist label
That may be an exaggeration. In addition to Biden, who has not announced his presidential campaign, moderate senators such as Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand have held back from populism.
Others, meanwhile, are probably stretching the definition. When Kamala Harris launched her campaign in Oakland in January, an aide to the California senator told New York magazine she was claiming the mantle of “a new populism”.
Her campaign slogan – “for the people” – is a nod to her career as San Francisco district attorney, but also a classically populist term. Yet while her speech referred to “the people” 15 times, it contained none of the sharp condemnation of elites that is also a hallmark of populist discourse. On the contrary, Harris made a point of stressing “our United States of America is not about us versus them”.
Even Barack Obama once toyed with the populist label. Reflecting on some of his leftwing policies, Obama openly mused on the idea that he might be a populist, but hedged: “Maybe somebody can pull up in a dictionary quickly the phrase ‘populism’.”
Had anyone bothered to do so they might have discovered the word is routinely misused. In Europe, it is often used pejoratively to refer to far-right, nationalist politics of leaders such as Italy’s Matteo Salvini and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. Many supporters of leftwing radicals such as the UK’s Jeremy Corbyn or France’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon balk at the populist label, which they argue tarnishes their candidates by association.
In the US, there is perhaps better understanding of the idea that populism can be a political language used by the right or left. But the word has also lost some of its meaning as it increasingly becomes a shorthand for economic redistribution. As a result, no candidate is more routinely referred to as populist than Sanders, but others include Warren and – until he dropped of the race – the Ohio senator Sherrod Brown.
Brown, one of the few politicians to embrace the populist label, dedicated a page on his campaign website to explaining “what populism is – and what it isn’t”. The page argued that populism “doesn’t fan resentments and exploit grievances”, a claim that might be disputed by scholars of leftwing populists such as Hugo Chávez – or even the original American populists, like Bryan Jennings.
‘We’re living in another Gilded Age’
Sixteen Democrats have so far formally declared bids for the presidency, and another dozen are criss-crossing the early caucus and primary states to test the waters. They include New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, who recently stopped by the Strange Brew Tavern in Manchester, for “happy hour with young Democrats”.
He told around a dozen party faithfuls gathered around a pool table that his “line” resonating most Iowa and South Carolina was that “there’s plenty of money in the country, it is just in the wrong hands”. “It don’t think it is an accident,” he added. “People are fed up.”
He later told the Guardian that populism was “very much part of who I am”.
“Recently in public discourse somehow populism has been described as a rightwing phenomenon, through a negative prism, when I think there’s a very rich history in the United States of progressive populism, centered on economic issues, referencing working people’s lives, and that’s what we have got to get back to,” he said.
De Blasio added he agreed with Warren’s proposal to break up technology giants. “I do see an emerging frustration with the technology sector that is about unfettered power. But also connects to the notion of large corporations, unaccountable to the people – just as people felt about Wall Street.”
“We’re living in another Gilded Age. The income inequality levels today are comparable to the time of the robber barons,” he added, arguing that a slew of political advances – anti-trust laws, progressive taxation and limits on corporate money in politics – were born of the populist backlash of the late 19th century.
“Those are all ideas that go back 100 years and more in this country,” he said. “Full circle, these ideas are now coming to life in much bolder form today.”
That much seemed evident in nearby Exeter, when Warren delighted the crowd, days earlier, with her unabashed attack on America’s “ultra millionaires”.
Nodding emphatically from a balcony above the stage was Janice, a woman in her 60s in a faded Mickey Mouse T-shirt. She declined to give her last name because she was embarrassed to admit she had voted for Trump in 2016.
“My friend kept saying: ‘Trump’s for the little people,’” she recalled – stressing that, at the time, she was holding down two jobs and struggling to pay the rent, so did not have time to vet the candidates.
She now believes Trump “talked that way to become president” – and after hearing Warren speak, she felt she’d found a more authentic version of the candidate she had been looking for. “Warren sounds like she’s on our side. And it’s us v them,” she said.",0.9688328504562378,2154,1.889519214630127
"A newly designed system of identifying molecules for treating hepatitis C should enable scientists to discover novel and effective therapies for the dangerous and difficult-to-cure disease of the liver, says Zhilei Chen, a Texas A&M University assistant professor of chemical engineering who helped develop the screening system.
The system, Chen explains, enables researchers to study the effects of molecules that obstruct all aspects of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle. That’s a significant milestone in HCV research, says Chen, noting that previous methods of developing drug treatments for the virus have been limited by the fact that researchers were only able to study one aspect of the HCV life cycle. Chen’s findings appear in the most recent edition of the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
First identified in 1989 and responsible for hepatitis C, an infectious disease affecting the liver, HCV has infected an estimated 180 million people worldwide. Spread by blood-to-blood contact, HCV can cause chronic infection that leads to dangerous scarring of the liver, liver failure, liver cancer and death.
Although new infections resulting from blood transfusions are rare thanks to screening measures that began in 1990, the overall number of people facing death or serious liver disease from HCV is steadily rising because people often live decades with the virus before showing symptoms, Chen says. In addition, injection drug users are at high risk for infection from contaminated needles.
The only existing therapy for HCV is a physically and emotionally taxing 48-week course of treatment that cures less than half of all patients who undergo it, Chen says. The particularly grueling nature of the treatment – it’s been compared to chemotherapy – as well as the high financial costs associated with it often result in many patients opting to forego the therapy.
Because Chen’s newly developed screening system enables the discovery of small, low-cost molecules that block the HCV life cycle, she believes it could contribute to new, more affordable and more effective therapies for hepatitis C.
The screening system uses an innovative way to “see” cells that are infected with HCV.
“Typically when a virus infects a cell, it’s not obvious to detect; it’s not easy to distinguish an infected cell from an uninfected cell,” Chen says. “Much in the same way a person who is infected with HCV does not initially feel anything, when a cell is initially infected nothing really observable happens. This makes it difficult to distinguish HCV infection in cells.”
To address this challenge, Chen “tweaked” the cells she was studying by inserting a gene into them that triggers cell death if HCV enters that cell. This allowed Chen to easily measure the extent of infection in her genetically engineered cells by quantifying the degree of cell death within the cell cultures she was examining.
These engineered cells were grown in miniature compartments in the presence of infectious HCV, and a different chemical was added to each compartment.
“We could then look and see which cells were able to survive because if you have chemicals that don’t inhibit HCV, the cells will die, but if you have a molecule that blocks the HCV life cycle, the cells will grow,” Chen says. “And because we were able to look at the complete life cycle of the virus with our system, we discovered inhibitors of the virus across three different stages: entry into cells, reproduction within cells, and final escape from infected cells to attack new cells.”
Testing about 1,000 different chemicals, Chen found several that strongly inhibited the HCV life cycle. Some of the inhibitors, she said, obstruct virus entry into a cell. Others inhibit virus replication, meaning that infected cells won’t be able to support the reproduction and growth of the virus as much. Chen also found effective inhibitors that keep the virus from escaping the cell even if it grows well inside the cell.
“Since this virus changes all of the time, you really want to hit it across multiple aspects simultaneously,” Chen says. “Nevertheless, most current efforts to block the HCV life cycle focus only on its replication within cells due to the long-time absence of a system that allows for convenient screening of molecules blocking other aspects of the virus’ life cycle such as entry into cells and release from cells.
“Our system is well-suited to large-scale drug screening efforts because the technology is simple to use and can be easily scaled up to test extremely large collections of compounds using a robotic system,” Chen says. “We anticipate that this system will enable the discovery of many more new and more potent HCV antivirals.”
Working with Chen to develop the system were Karuppiah Chockalingam and Rudo Simeon, postdoctoral associate and graduate student, respectively, from Texas A&M and Charles Rice, professor from Rockefeller University.",0.9605183005332947,1020,3.4873762130737305

"Chart-topping K-pop group NewJeans announced Thursday their decision to leave their label ADOR, accusing the company of “mistreatment”.
The news comes two weeks after the girl group sent an ultimatum to ADOR parent company HYBE—behind K-pop sensation BTS—telling the firm they would terminate their contract unless a set of demands was met.
“From midnight today, our contract will be terminated with ADOR,” member Minji said at a press conference.
NewJeans made their debut in 2022 and the K-pop phenomenon is among HYBE’s most successful groups.
Band member Hanni said Thursday the group has “faced mistreatment, not just towards us but also including our staff,” without elaborating.
NewJeans experienced “deliberate miscommunications and manipulation regarding multiple areas,” she said.
“This is not the type of work ethic we respect and not one we want to be a part of, and to continue working under a company with no intention of protecting NewJeans would only do us harm,” said Hanni.
ADOR did not immediately respond to AFP requests to comment on the announcement.
The band members said they would continue with their contractual obligations, but acknowledged they may no longer be able to use the name NewJeans.
“However, that doesn’t mean that we are giving up on the name at all,” said Danielle.
“We will continue to fight for NewJeans. NewJeans never die.”
The group’s demands addressed to HYBE included an apology for a comment by one of the company’s managers, who is accused by NewJeans of bullying, and the immediate reinstatement of their producer Min Hee-jin.
Min resigned last week from ADOR’s board of directors after HYBE accused her of breach of trust, which sparked a sprawling legal and PR battle.
Industry experts said the decision by NewJeans was expected.
“The contract termination lawsuit itself has been widely anticipated in the market, so today’s press conference, in a way, seems to have a predetermined outcome,” said Lim Soo-jin, an analyst at Daishin Securities.
“Entertainment analysts have generally excluded NewJeans-related projections from next year’s estimates, so the overall impact is not expected to be substantial,” he told AFP.
The hefty fee which NewJeans may have to pay will compensate for “financial loss” at the label, he added.
The K-pop group may have to face a contractual penalty of up to 620 billion won ($440 million) according to legal experts.
The band members, however, disagree.
“We have not breached the exclusive contract and have done our best in our activities so far, so we believe there is no reason for us to pay any penalty,” said band member Haerin.
“On the contrary, it is ADOR and HYBE that violated the contract, leading to this situation, and the responsibility clearly lies with them.”",0.969224750995636,665,0.9964051246643066

Construction companies can also think creatively about how to send their cards. They might work with local providers who use green shipping methods. Or, they could send digital cards to avoid mailing altogether. This way, they show they care about the planet while still spreading holiday cheer.",0.9335154891014099,2400,1.548491358757019
"Bruce Willis, the film star known for his roles in “Die Hard” and “Pulp Fiction,” will step away from his decades-long movie career in the wake of a recent aphasia diagnosis. His ex-wife, Demi Moore, shared the news in an Instagram post, saying the disease was “impacting his cognitive abilities.”
Dr. Borna Bonakdarpour, a behavioral neurologist with Northwestern Medicine, said about one million people in the United States currently had aphasia, which disrupts the ability to speak, read and write.
What is aphasia?
Aphasia is a constellation of symptoms that make it difficult or impossible to express or comprehend language. The disorder stems from damage to the parts of the brain that are responsible for language functions, which are typically housed on the left side of the brain. Aphasia can be devastating for patients, disrupting their ability to take part in everyday life.
All cases of aphasia stem from neurological changes in the brain. Strokes resulting in brain damage are the number-one cause, said Dr. Shazam Hussain, director of the Cerebrovascular Center at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. But it can also be caused by degenerative conditions like dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, other triggers include brain injuries, including from severe blows to the head; brain tumors; gunshot wounds and brain infections.
How does aphasia manifest itself?
There are several types of aphasia, all of which have an outsize impact on patients. Those with expressive aphasia may struggle to speak in complete sentences or find the words they are looking for. “It’s very frustrating,” Dr. Hussain said.
They may also have trouble remembering the words for certain objects, said Dr. Bonakdarpour, which leads them to pause for long periods of time, often in the middle of their sentences.
Other patients have receptive aphasia; they may experience intense confusion when people talk to them, and they may fail to follow conversations.
A person can experience receptive aphasia and expressive aphasia, but some experience only one or the other.
Global aphasia is a condition in which all four of the main language modalities — speaking, understanding, reading and writing — are severely impaired, leaving a person unable to communicate, said Karen Gendal, a speech-language pathologist at N.Y.U. Langone Rusk Rehabilitation.
Are there warning signs?
While aphasia occurs mostly in patients over the age of 65, it can develop at any age. The condition can come on suddenly, particularly in the wake of a stroke, but some people with aphasia develop it gradually. “Their sentences become shorter and shorter,” Dr. Hussain said. “Then, they get to a point where they have difficulty expressing any language at all.” Patients may also find that their ability to read or write worsens over time.
“Everyone can have periods where they’re busy or distracted or forgetting a word,” Dr. Hussain said. But if your inability to communicate holds you back from day-to-day activities, keeps growing more severe or, crucially, if friends and family point out a pattern that you are not aware of, seek medical attention, he said. People with aphasia typically lose insight into their interactions with others.
“If it’s really preventing your communication, that’s when you should be worried,” Dr. Bonakdarpour said. “If you’re forgetting a word here and there, that’s OK.”
Are there ways to prevent aphasia?
There is no guaranteed technique to prevent aphasia, but you can take simple steps to boost your brain health in general, Dr. Hussain said. Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly and watch out for stroke risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. Smoking can also elevate your risk for stroke and aphasia. “The healthier you can keep your brain overall, the less a chance of these or other issues of the brain developing,” Dr. Hussain said.
Are there treatments?
While there is no cure, patients with aphasia can seek speech and occupational therapy.
The National Aphasia Association recommends two primary methods of treatment. Impairment-based therapies involve evaluating and then targeting specific reading, speaking and writing skills through activities like fill-in-the-blank exercises and training patients to remember synonyms and antonyms. Communication-based therapies focus on rebuilding conversation and cognition skills that patients use to participate in everyday activities; they may role-play scenarios like ordering a coffee or speaking on a video call, said Ms. Gendal, the speech-language pathologist.
Support groups are also available across the United States and online to help people cope with the toll of the condition.",0.9526715874671936,1048,2.3273134231567383

"Chinese Actress Reveals ‘Rotting’ Nose from Cosmetic Surgery That Put Career on Hold
By Ryan General
Chinese actress Gao Liu shared images of her damaged nose resulting from a botched cosmetic procedure.
Liu was doing well in her career and featured in multiple projects when she suddenly stayed out of the public view for months.
The rising star would later explain on her Weibo account that she laid low for months due to a “cosmetic surgical incident” that resulted in nose necrosis, the death of the tip’s tissue, BBC reports.
In sharing the photos with her five million followers, Liu said she wanted to caution people against the possible harm that cosmetic surgery can do.
According to Liu, she decided to undergo surgery after a friend recommended a plastic surgeon from a clinic in Guangzhou.
Liu noted that she was advised to “get a slight trim” and thought that doing so would bolster her career.
“The entire procedure lasted four hours. I thought that in these four hours, I would be made more beautiful,” she wrote on Weibo. “I didn’t expect these four hours to be the beginning of a nightmare.”
She described her nose feeling “irritated and tingly” soon after the procedure was finished.
While the surgeon told her she would be able to go back to work by December or January, she hadn’t done so because her nose got infected repeatedly.
Liu revealed she had thoughts of committing suicide as the situation got worse.
“The skin on the tip of my nose… became darker and darker, and my nose became necrotic,” she added.
The extent of the damage was so severe that she would have to wait for at least a year before she can undergo reconstructive surgery.
Liu said she lost 400,000 yuan ($61,900) in work after being hospitalized for two months.
Data from the Tianhe District Health Bureau revealed that the clinic committed unspecified offenses that resulted in five administrative penalties between March and October 2020.
Liu’s revelation has resulted in other individuals coming forward with their own complaints about the clinic.

"Japanese researchers unveil digital reconstruction of 1,600-year-old woman
By Ryan General
Researchers in Japan have digitally reconstructed the image of a woman born 1,600 years ago using DNA technology and advanced computer graphics.
The research team of scientists from seven research institutes in collaboration with the education board of Yonezawa city released the photo and video of the recreated model dubbed “Himiko of Okitama” on Nov. 4.
Himiko is depicted with droopy eyes, a flat nose and straight black hair in the images made possible via DNA analysis and forensic facial reconstruction.
The woman’s skin color and hair type were reportedly determined based on genetic data derived from her skeletal remains exhumed in 1982. Her “drooping eyes” were based on her skin’s estimated thickness.
The bones were extracted from a stone coffin found in the No. 137 Totsukayama grave, one of the 200 graves situated at the foot of Mount Totsukayama in Yonezawa’s Asagawa district.
Himiko’s coffin also contained a long-tooth comb and a small knife.
A study conducted by Dokkyo Medical University revealed that the woman was around 143 to 145 centimeters tall and is estimated to have died at around 40 years old.
In 2017, a separate excavation conducted by Tohoku Gakuin University at the Haizukayama burial mound site in Kitakata led to the unearthing of the skeletal remains of a 50-year-old man.
The research team held a symposium in Yonezawa City on Nov. 13 to explain the process involved in Himiko’s reconstruction project.
The project began after nuclear DNA sampled from her teeth was compared with the man’s remains, leading to the conclusion that her genetic data was about 96 to 97 percent well-preserved, reported The Asahi Shimbun.
Tohoku Gakuin University’s Hideto Tsuji, who led the project, noted that the “entire data of nuclear DNA” they obtained from the remains is rarely found in old human bones.
In 2021, Tohoku University’s Yuka Hatano and Toshihiko Suzuki began studying the woman’s remains and reconstructing her facial features. The research team also commissioned the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo to analyze the nuclear DNA.
The results of the National Museum of Nature and Science’s analysis indicate that she had straight black hair as well as brown or blackish brown skin. Her eyes were reportedly a color between black and brown.
While Himiko’s skull had already lost its nasal bone and part of its right side, the researchers were able to visualize how the ancient woman likely clenched her teeth, which may provide insights into her eating habits.
“Her teeth were found worn down with apparent signs of temporomandibular joint dysfunction,” Hatano said. “The conditions seemingly resulted from her chewing style and other habits, and her jaw was distorted slightly leftward.”
The researchers noted that while they think Himiko may have originated from people in the Yayoi Pottery Culture Period (1000 B.C.- 250 A.D.) she also shares traits from people in the earlier Jomon Pottery Culture Period (c. 14500 B.C.-1000 B.C.).

"The Jets have already brought in some big names this offseason, but could GM Joe Douglas have one more trick up his sleeve?
Mike Garafolo of NFL Network reports that San Francisco 49ers star wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk has officially requested a trade following stalled-out contract extension talks.
So, could the Jets come calling for the former first-round pick?
The Arizona State product would surely be a fit on any NFL team, as he’s gotten better in each of his four pro seasons, culminating with a 2023 campaign in which he caught 75 passes for 1,342 and seven touchdowns. Over the course of his career, Aiyuk has averaged 14.4 yards per touch, proving to be one of the more explosive players in the NFL with the ball in his hands.
The Jets already made a splashy move at receiver this offseason, inking former Los Angeles Chargers wideout Mike Williams to start opposite Garrett Wilson. But Williams has dealt with injury issues during his career, and even if he is healthy the Jets could certainly stand to give Aaron Rodgers another weapon. A trio of Wilson, Williams, and Aiyuk would give the Jets perhaps the best “big three” in the NFL.
The Jets have some intriguing names on the wide receiver depth chart, such as third-round pick Malachi Corley and the disappointing Allen Lazard, who has strong rapport with Rodgers. But no current Jet could replicate the star power that Aiyuk would bring to the field.
Aiyuk is currently set to play the 2024 season on his fifth-year option, which would pay him roughly $14 million, but any potential trade for the 26-year-old would almost certainly have to include a new contract as well.

"Nov. 26—Dean Janikowski didn’t get the news until shortly after Tuesday’s Washington State practice, which took place in the new Taylor Sports Complex, thanks to temperatures dipping into the 30s as November rolls along.
He’s one of three finalists for the Wuerffel Trophy, which goes to the college football player who best exemplifies community service, academic excellence and athletic performance.
“It’s a huge honor,” Janikowski said. “I remember being young and seeing that award, and it’s a huge honor, especially just all the work that we put in, giving to the community. It’s cool to be given that recognition. It’s a really honorable award, and we’re super pumped about it.”
Janikowski, the Cougars’ sixth-year kicker, has earned the recognition in large part through the Heather Janikowski Foundation in honor of his late mother, raising more than $150,000 to support cancer research and patients. Since arriving at WSU, he has launched the “More Than a Kick” and “Kicking Cancer” initiatives, encouraging donations for each field goal and extra point he makes.
Janikowski has stayed busy organizing fundraising events like the Do it For Her 5K and Monserrate Memorial Hike, donating to people in need and using his platform to support cancer patients in his community.
The winner will be announced live on an awards show on ESPN on Dec. 12. The recipient will also be formally honored at a gala in February at the College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta.
Before then, Janikowski will wrap up his time playing at Gesa Field — Martin Stadium when he joined the WSU program as a preferred walk-on in 2019 — when the Cougs host Wyoming on Saturday afternoon.
Bowl-bound WSU will still get another several weeks of practice and a bowl game, but it amounts to the end of a long career in Pullman for Janikowski.

"With inventory remaining tight in 2023, dealers may be looking to extend their credit to and look at getting a floor plan to remain competitive.
In the April issue of UCD, we look at floor planning and get practical advice on getting started.
“Sourcing inventory in a tight market requires independent dealers to have a plan in place to make smart buying and pricing decisions,” said Scott Maybee, president of NextGear Capital. “Using a flexible floor planning strategy can make a dealer’s inventory work for them and stay competitive in any environment.”
NextGear is the largest inventory finance company in North America, providing lines of credit for dealers at more than 1,000 auctions throughout the nation.
Floor plan lending differs from borrowing from traditional financial institutions. Floor plans often have more flexible terms for dealers to meet needs for types of vehicles or payments. Floor plan lenders specialize in lending to dealerships and understand the capital needs for different markets.
“Dealers need terms that fit their needs. From flexible pricing and eliminating fees, it allows them to keep more money in their dealership,” Maybee said.
Terms will be dictated by performance of the dealership in turning vehicles.
Also in the April issue, find our Dealer Spotlight story on Melissa McCown of Amigo Motors in Houston. In the two years since the death of her husband Patrick, she and Mi Amigos in Houston had persevered through an embezzlement, break-in and even a tornado that wiped out a planned expanded collections department. But after nearly reaching her breaking point, she knew she needed to keep going. And meeting with peers, she received something more valuable than the list of items to work on for her dealership in that initial Dallas visit.

"Edinburgh Science Festival: Play On
As part of the Edinburgh International Science Festival in 2017, I designed and built 5 interactive exhibits for the Play On exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland. I was aided in this by MAKLab (sadly now no more), who took care of construction of the various physical housings for the different exhibits.
The exhibits consisted of:
A videogame exhibit inspired by Martin Jonasson and Petri Purho's Juice It or Lose It talk. Harpoon! is a simple arcade game about collecting fruit to score points, with the ability to add and remove layers of 'juice' (e.g. sound, animation, visual effects etc.) to see how those layers change the feel of the game.
Two instances of Harpoon! were installed for the exhibition; one that was locked to the simplest mode (no sound, monochrome, simple blocky graphics), and another that incorporated a chunky rotary switch with which players could add and remove the various layers of juice.
A simple subtractive synthesizer designed to demonstrate how sound can be generated via software or electronics. Consisting of a single oscillator (with Sine, Sawtooth and Square waveforms), a low pass filter, an envelope with 3 preset shapes, and a small screen displaying visually the effect of the user's interactions with the various controls.
Three instruments connected to screens displaying an oscilloscope-style display of those instruments' vibrations when excited. The instruments were: a set of 3 guitar strings mounted to a small resonating box; a guiro, and a set of 4 chime bars. Contact mics were used to transmit the instruments' vibrations to 3 Raspberry Pi's, which powered the displays.
A soundfile-playback exhibit designed to demonstrate the difference between synthesized sounds and their real-life counterparts. Four sound types (Violin, Piano, Trumpet, Birds) were included, each with a button to play the synthesized version, and another to play the real version. When pressed, a third, smaller button would illuminate the button corresponding to the real sound.
A simple soundfile-playback exhibit which plays a binaural recording of a herd of sheep being shepherded when its button is pressed.
All exhibits were built around the Raspberry Pi, with a Teensy LC providing an interface for the more complicated exhibits.",0.9516736268997192,489,1.8371820449829102

In eastern Texas, Caddo Lake State Park is a natural lake that is operated by the state as a wildlife management area. This lake is the only one of its kind in Texas. It is home to many different species of birds and is perfect for bird watching. It is also great for fishing.
The lake is the largest natural lake in Texas and straddles the border between Texas and Louisiana. It has a long, mysterious history. In the early 1900s, it was home to a pearl rush, where people made their fortunes collecting freshwater mussels. This lake is not ideal for swimming, because there are alligators and snakes, but it is perfect for soaking up the sights and sounds of water.
The park has a lakeside campground where you can camp. You can choose between tent sites and RV sites. There are also cabins for rent. Cabins built by the CCC in the 1930s are in excellent condition and are a great way to stay near the water. The park has four hiking trails that are great for exploring the lake and surrounding area.
The lake was once a flooded swamp. Before the lake was developed, it was a river port. During the mid-19th century, it was home to the biggest steamboat port in Texas. Its location made it an important river port. The lake was created in order to allow steamboats to travel the river.
The lake is surrounded by thick bald cypress trees. This beautiful ecosystem is home to numerous aquatic plants and a variety of fish. The park also features cabins built by the Civiliitimental Conservation Corps.

"Deep learning: why should you care?
Deep learning is currently taking the IT world by storm. Facebook, Bloomberg and Google are actively exploring deep learning techniques. Thousands of deep learning startups operating in various industries raise seed funding every day. If you like traveling, have the budget and want to find out more about deep learning technology, there are so many events dedicated to it that you can attend them on a weekly basis.
In fact, deep learning is simply a family of general machine learning methods that use neural networks with more than one hidden layer. So some people are probably wondering why the bar of expectations is set so high.
Like many other machine-learning algorithms, it is inspired by what we know about the biological brain. Like humans, it tries to automatically extract higher layer features from the input (observations). However due to its iterative multilayer architecture, it can learn to represent high-level features more accurately than the previous generation of neural networks. The key factor is that instead of hand-engineered features, deep learning algorithms use trainable features that extract from the observations automatically. This requires more calculations and more training data, but allows us to discover dependencies that were previously unavailable.
The idea of multilayer neural networks is not new: the deep learning paradigm is a reincarnation of traditional neural networks from the early 1990s, which were proposed to improve the quality of machine-driven, quantitative prediction processes. Back then, neural networks were used for prediction analysis and classification.
I remember when I was writing my Master thesis in 1998, neural networks was a buzzword in the IT community. Of course, I took the opportunity to train my first neural network for prediction of FOREX market currency exchange rates with the aim of using the results for my thesis. The training process took 2 weeks, accuracy was completely disappointing and the system could not operate in real time, which depreciated its real value dramatically. It was a big fiasco and I had to swiftly change the topic of my thesis.
Other people were a bit luckier than I was: there were some successful and many mediocre attempts to use neural networks in financial analysis, image recognition and non-linear classification. However, until the mid 2000s the use of full-scale neural networks was extremely challenging throughout the world, due to the lack of sufficient computational resources that made training the networks extremely time-consuming. Another problem that limited the widespread practical use of neural networks was the absence of a fully-fledged methodology to integrate them into statistical frameworks.
These limitations were overcome in the mid-2000s for two reasons: (1) progress in computer technology made it possible to significantly reduce the time needed to train neural networks; and (2) the emergence of new methods for system training made it possible to optimize the training process, in turn dramatically boosting final quality. Modern deep learning systems are widely used to understand raw data, in object classification (text recognition) and computer vision (for example, age estimation from photos) and even in text understanding.
With regard to machine translation, a deep learning system can accurately learn a hierarchy of features representing higher levels of abstraction (semantics) derived from lower levels (lexical features) via intermediate steps (morphology, syntax, etc.). In fact, it has enough power to help us achieve the holy grail of computational linguistics: a cheap way of incorporating semantics into machine translation processes.
In the next post, I will cover some methods of how deep learning can be used to improve the quality of machine translation in industrial settings.
